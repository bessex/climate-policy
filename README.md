Understanding how media representation shapes political outcomes for climate policy. 

Our research goal is to examine climate policy and its representation in the media and analyze whether this information can be used to predict political outcomes. This analysis will require a relatively large corpus of news articles from recent years. Articles will subsequently be labeled according to the media bias of the source (manually assigned by the editors at AllSides.com).

We expect to use clustering and regression techniques to explore the ways in which different political biases present climate policy and to uncover any potential correlation between media coverage and political outcomes. This may require sentiment analysis using a pre-trained model; however, the results will be incorporated as a part of our larger analysis. In order to correlate with political outcomes, we may also acquire congressional voting data for the specific policies we're examining. 

This topic is particularly compelling as it offers an opportunity to uncover the connection between media and political outcomes, especially in the context of climate policy. Furthermore, sentiment trends may have important ramifications for the future of climate policy. If the results can be generalized to policy writ large, these techniques may be powerful tools for future political analysis.
