    "body": "More than 80 student loan forgiveness bills and other student loan legislation was introduced during the 116th session of Congress (2019-2020), but only 2 bills were enacted. Four-fifths (80%) of the bills were introduced in the House and 20% in the Senate. More than a third of the student loan bills concerned student loan forgiveness. \n \nA quarter of the bills had bipartisan support. Yet, even with bipartisan support, it is difficult for legislation to reach the floor of the House or Senate for a vote. For example, bills to eliminate origination fees on federal student loans were introduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate, but were never reported out of committee. \n \nSessions of Congress last for two calendar years. At the end of a session, any legislation that has not been enacted into law will expire and will need to be reintroduced in the next session to be considered.\n \n \n  \n  \n   \n   Only about 2% of student loan bills introduced in the 116th session of Congress were passed by both ... [+] the House and Senate.\n \n   \n  getty \n  \n \n \nLegislation that Passed Both the House and Senate\n \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (H.R. 133). This bipartisan bill has passed the House and Senate and awaits the President\u2019s signature. The President has threatened to veto it, but it was passed with a veto-proof majority of 92-6 in the Senate and 359-63 in the House. In addition to providing a COVID-19 relief package, the legislation extends the tax-free status of employer-paid student loan repayment assistance programs by five years, until December 31, 2025. \n \n \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (H.R. 748).

The legislation provides a student loan payment pause and interest waiver through September 30, 2020 on federal education loans that are held by the U.S. Department of Education. The legislation also provides temporary tax-free status for employer-paid student loan repayment assistance programs (LRAPS), waives the non-federal share in campus-based federal student aid programs and provides emergency financial aid grants to college students. During the payment pause and interest waiver, suspended loan payments count as payments toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness, income-driven repayment plans and loan rehabilitation.

The student must be able to repay the debt and must agree to the transfer.

Introduced by Rep.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) on 1/28/2020, this bill requires private student loans to be included in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).

The loan payments would be 15% of discretionary income, defined as the amount by which total income exceeds 150% of the poverty line.

Interest rates on new loans could not increase by more than 0.5% compared to the previous year\u2019s loans. The interest rates would be fixed rates. Current interest rates are equal to the high yield on the last 10-Year Treasury Note auction in May plus a margin of 2.05% to 4.6%. In effect, this change in the interest rates eliminates the margin. \n \nGuaranteeing Respite After College Ends (GRACE) Act (H.R. 3792). Introduced by Rep. Kendra S.

Introduced by Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA-37) with 20 cosponsors on 6/13/2020, this bill creates a 10/10 student loan repayment plan in which loan payments are based on 10% of the borrower\u2019s discretionary income \u2013 the amount by which AGI exceeds 150% of the poverty line \u2013 with tax-free forgiveness of $45,520 of the remaining principal balance, plus any interest that has accrued on this balance, after 120 monthly loan payments (10 years).

Introduced by Rep. Peter A.

The bill provides partial loan forgiveness for borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) after 60 qualifying payments. The partial loan forgiveness would be retroactive. The number of repayment plans would be reduced to two, a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. Payments under the income-driven repayment plan will be based on 10% of discretionary income, which is defined as the amount by which adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds 225% of the poverty line, with forgiveness of the remaining debt after 300 loan payments (25 years).\n \nStrengthening Loan Forgiveness for Public Servants Act (H.R. 3096).

The bill also makes the 20- or 25-year forgiveness in income-driven repayment plans tax-free. The bill replaces the $2,500 cap on interest eligible for the student loan interest deduction with the interest on up to $750,000 of qualified education loans (twice that for married borrowers filing jointly). \n \nPhysician Assistant Higher Education Modernization Act (H.R. 1685). Introduced by Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA-37) with 8 cosponsors on 3/12/2019, this bipartisan bill increases the loan limits for graduate students in physician assistant programs and creates a loan forgiveness program for physician assistants who work in areas of national need. \n \nDebt-Free College Act of 2019 (H.R. 1571 and S. 672). Introduced by Rep. Mark Pcan (D-WI-2) with 35 cosponsors in the House and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) with 9 cosponsors in the Senate on 3/6/2019, this bill provides a debt-free in-state public college education through a federal-state partnership. This bill also provides full eligibility for federal student aid for Dreamers. This bill also repeals the suspension of federal student aid for students convicted of sale or possession of controlled substances while receiving federal student aid. \n \nREDI (Resident Education Deferred Interest) Act (H.R. 1554). Introduced by Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX-36) with 89 cosponsors on 3/6/2019, this bipartisan bill provides interest-free deferments on Direct Loans for borrowers serving in a medical or dental internship or residency. \u00a0\n \nEmployer Participation in Repayment Act of 2019 (H.R. 1043). Introduced by Rep. Scott H. Peters (D-CA-52) with 271 cosponsors on 2/7/2019, this bipartisan bill makes up to $5,250 per year in employer-paid student loan repayment assistance programs (LRAPs) tax-free. A similar provision was included in the CARES Act.\n \nPrivate Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act (H.R. 885). Introduced by Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN-9) with 14 cosponsors on 1/30/2019, this bill makes private student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy without requiring a demonstration of undue hardship.",

    "body": "On December 2, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) attempted and failed to pass H.R. 8, the dangerously flawed, so-called \u201cuniversal\u201d background check bill. As you may recall, Nancy Pelosi and her anti-gun allies in the\u00a0U.S. House passed this misguided legislation earlier this year. H.R. 8 would do nothing to prevent crime, could not be enforced without a federal gun registry, and would turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals for simply loaning a firearm to friends or family members.\nSen. Murphy tried to bypass regular order, normally consisting of a committee hearing and markup, and instead offered a \u201cunanimous consent\u201d request to pass H.R. 8. Under unanimous consent, the Senate can pass legislation without any debate or a recorded vote. Fortunately for law-abiding gun owners, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Sen. Murphy\u2019s unanimous consent request\u2013effectively blocking H.R. 8 from moving forward.\n In response, Sen. Grassley offered an alternative unanimous consent request for S.1775, the\u00a0Protecting Communities and Preserving the Second Amendment Act of 2021\u2013legislation that would actually reduce violent crime while bolstering protections for law-abiding gun owners.\n S. 1775 would increase prosecutions and penalties for those that violate the myriad of gun laws already on the books \u2013an approach NRA has supported for decades. Further, the bill would ensure that National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) contains appropriate records so the system is fast, accurate, and fair. Moreover, S. 1775 would prevent Americans from being unjustly stripped of their Second Amendment rights without due process, as well as strengthen protections for the interstate transportation of firearms and ammunition.\n Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, Sen. Murphy objected to S. 1775\u2019s consideration. This objection is merely more evidence that Sen. Murphy and his gun control allies in the U.S. Senate are not interested in prosecuting criminals or ensuring constitutional protections, but instead seek to limit the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.",

    "body": "House Minority Leader explains what's really in Democrats' election reform bill on 'Fox News Primetime'\n\n\n\n\nWith the \"Corrupt Politicians Act\" (H.R. 1/S. 1) floundering, Democrats are now planning to take over elections from Washington via last year\u2019s failed H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. \u00a0\nDespite its inspirational label, H.R. 4 is the Left\u2019s Trojan horse to accomplish many of H.R. 1/S. 1\u2019s policy goals through a back door.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll Americans \u2013 particularly Republicans in Congress \u2013 need to recognize H.R. 4 for the unnecessary power grab it truly is, and not be fooled by false propaganda about \"voting rights.\"\u00a0\nHANS VON SPAKOVSKY: MERRICK GARLAND'S MISLEADING VOTING CLAIMS \u2013 WHAT AG GETS WRONG ABOUT US ELECTIONS\nAll Americans can be proud that voting rights have never been stronger \u2013 or more widely enjoyed by Americans of every background \u2013 than they are today in 2021. It\u2019s the voting outcomes that Democrats don\u2019t like \u2013 and shredding long-held norms is their strategy du jour to change those outcomes.\u00a0\nH.R. 4 would put more power in the hands of the federal government to control state election procedures, make it harder for states to enact important election integrity safeguards, lower the legal standards for obtaining injunctions, and allow the federal government to use its new power to attack laws in the states well beyond voting rights.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nWe do not even know yet exactly what will be in this year\u2019s version. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it would not be re-introduced until the fall so that Democrats can fix its constitutional problems. \u00a0\nNot that unconstitutional power grabs have stopped Pelosi in the past. In reality, Pelosi\u2019s delay is more about a continuing current push to pass pieces of H.R. 1 before shifting to H.R. 4.\u00a0\nLast year\u2019s H.R. 4 would have resurrected the preclearance coverage formula of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, which required certain states and localities to receive approval from Washington for proposed election changes. Preapproval was required for even minor changes like moving a polling place from the firehouse to the community center! Should this be a matter for federal government intervention?\u00a0\nThe justification for preclearance made sense when the VRA was passed 56 years ago: to combat the abuses and actual voter suppression of the Jim Crow South. Over time, it became a political tool to keep D.C. bureaucrats in charge of voting rules in many states.\u00a0\u00a0\nBecause the VRA\u2019s preclearance system was obsolete, the Supreme Court invalidated Section 5\u2019s formula in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013.\u00a0\u00a0\nPredictably, the left was outraged and declared that the Supreme Court had gutted the VRA.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe motivation for H.R. 4 is clear: to improve Democrats\u2019 chances of winning elections.\u00a0\n But Section 2 of the VRA is still in force and prohibits any election procedure that denies or abridges \"the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" In other words, it protects voting rights against actual discrimination.\u00a0\u00a0\nDemocrats know this, as they frequently successfully use Section 2 in court to attack laws protecting the integrity of elections.\u00a0For example, it was used to invalidate both North Carolina\u2019s and Texas\u2019 voter ID laws.\u00a0\nThe VRA is one of the Democrats\u2019 favorite tools to attack good laws that protect the integrity of elections. Why are they so intent on \"reauthorizing\" it?\u00a0\nWithout reviving the obsolete preclearance system, Democrats do not have the power to overrule state election rules they do not like. It is far easier for a D.C. bureaucrat to veto a state law through preclearance than to have to fight the law in court, and win.\u00a0\u00a0\nH.R. 4 would resurrect the old preclearance system on steroids.\u00a0Under H.R. 4, a state would be subject to preclearance requirements after \"committing\" a certain number of voting rights violations, including challenges that do not find discriminatory intent and when the state enters into a consent decree or settlement.\u00a0\u00a0\nLiberal groups could file even more frivolous litigation to achieve settlements that ultimately subject states to the new preclearance requirements. Progressives will game the system under H.R. 4 to give D.C. power over any state they chose.\u00a0\nAdditionally, H.R. 4 would shift the burden of proof, requiring states to prove the innocence of their laws, rather than the federal government to show discrimination. Injunctions would be granted if the plaintiff simply raises \"a serious question\" without actual evidence. This standard is unprecedented in U.S. jurisprudence. It makes a mockery of our adversarial system.\u00a0\nDemocrats claim H.R. 4 is necessary because voter suppression has surged post-Shelby County. Yet minority turnout, especially in states previously subject to Section 5\u2019s preclearance requirements, is the highest it has ever been! Mississippi had the second-highest black turnout in the nation at 72.8% in 2020.\u00a0Where\u2019s the suppression?\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSince the VRA can still be used to fight actual voter suppression and minority turnout is surging in red states, the motivation for H.R. 4 is clear: to improve Democrats\u2019 chances of winning elections.\u00a0\nJohn Lewis would surely have agreed that stacking the election law deck to ensure a specific partisan outcome would have been anathema to the authors of the landmark Voting Rights Act. If Democrats don\u2019t like the results of fair elections \u2013 in which minority voter turnout has never been higher \u2013 they should run better candidates, who stand for principles more voters find attractive.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM HARMEET DHILLON",

Michael San Nicolas (D-GU), and H.R. 5913, the \u201cProtecting Investors from Excessive SPACs Fees Act of 2021,\u201d sponsored by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), were both introduced on November 9, 2021 and subsequently referred to the House Committee on Financial Services (the \u201cCommittee\u201d).\u00a0 On November 16, after a full committee markup, H.R. 5910 and H.R. 5913 passed the Committee and were ordered reported by a vote of 27-23 and 29-23, respectively.\n\nH.R. 5910\u00a0proposes to amend the securities laws to exclude all SPACs from the safe harbor for forward-looking statements (the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d).\u00a0 Currently, only forward-looking statements made in connection with the offering of securities by a blank check company are excluded from the Safe Harbor.\u00a0 The Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) defines a blank check company as \u201ca development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person\u201d that issues \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\u00a0 The House bill would amend Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act to replace the term \u201cblank check company\u201d with \u201ca development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to acquire or merge with an unidentified company, entity, or person.\u201d\u00a0 Without reference to issuing penny stocks, H.R. 5910 would exclude all SPACs from the Safe Harbor, not just SPACs issuing penny stock.\n\nIn May 2021, the Committee circulated a draft version of H.R. 5910 in advance of its hearing, entitled \u201cGoing Public: SPACs, Direct Listings, Public Offerings, and the Need for Investor Protections.\u201d\n\nH.R. 5913\u00a0proposes to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201c\u201840 Act\u201d) and the Exchange Act, to prevent investment advisers, as defined by the \u201840 Act, and brokers and registered representatives of brokers, as defined by Exchange Act, from recommending SPAC securities to a non-accredited investor unless the SPAC\u2019s promote or other economic compensation is less than 5% or the SPAC makes certain disclosures mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d).\u00a0 The legislation would compel the Commission to promulgate a rule requiring the disclosure by SPACs of compensation arrangements, such as a promote, granted to the sponsor of the SPAC when the arrangement would lead to dilutive effects affecting investors in the SPAC. \u00a0The dilutive effects of the awards of promotes have been widely criticized.\n\nIn April 2021, the first SPAC-focused legislation introduced, S. 1405, the\u00a0\u201cSponsor Promote and Compensation (SPAC) Act,\u201d attempted to address the issue of dilutive effects of the compensation structures of SPACs through enhanced disclosure and transparency. The Senate bill was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in April, but has not advanced since.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler testified for the second time as Chair before the Committee in early October. In his\u00a0prepared remarks, due to certain fees and potential conflicts inherent within SPAC structures, Chair Gensler asked the Staff of the Commission for recommendations relating to enhancing disclosures by SPACs so investors can better understand the associated costs and risks. When questioned about timing a proposed rule, Chair Gensler mentioned he had received preliminary recommendations on enhanced SPAC disclosure but was not prepared to confirm a timeframe.\n\nIn her opening statement during the November 16 full committee markup, Committee Chairwoman, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), highlighted that \u201cSPACs\u2026can go public and avoid key IPO requirements,\u201d which, she continued, exposes retail investors to \u201creal risks.\u201d \u00a0As SPACs continue to search for initial business combination targets, we expect regulatory and legislative efforts to try to address these and other perceived issues associated with the popular IPO alternative.",

That included supplemental funding so that the agency could handle COVID-19-related expenses. \n\n\nAn increase that averages out to roughly $8.9 billion per year would represent a significant boost to the agency\u2019s budget. However, the relative bounty for the IRS in H.R. 5376 comes with some congressional direction. \n\n\n\nPart 3 of H.R. 5376 spells out the specific allocations to the IRS to enhance the agency\u2019s resources and improve compliance efforts. The breakdown is as follows: \n\n\n \n Taxpayer services: $3,181,500,000;\n \n Enforcement: $45,637,400,000;\n \n Operations support: $25,326,400,000; \n \n Business systems modernization: $4,750,700,000;\n \n Task force to design free, direct e-file system: $15,000,000;\n \n Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration: $403,000,000;\n \n Treasury Office of Tax Policy: $104,533,803;\n \n Tax Court: $153,000,000; and\n \n Treasury departmental offices for oversight and implementation support to help the IRS implement the IRA: $50,000,000.\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal: $79,621,533,803 \n\nEnforcement is the biggest line item, and it's the one that H.R. 5376's drafters hope will help support the revenue estimate of $124 billion in increased collections over the 10-year budget window. \n\n\nThe bill is fairly vague on expectations for the IRS's spending with the increased enforcement budget. It lists \u201cnecessary expenses for tax enforcement activities,\u201d as well as legal and litigation support and enforcement of criminal statutes regarding tax law violations. \n\n\nThe bill also specifies \u201cdigital asset monitoring and compliance activities\u201d and investigative technology for use in criminal investigations as items on which the IRS should spend the money.\n\n \n  \n   \n   Cryptocurrency of the Bitcoins lying on the american dollar banknote. Business concept of new ... [+] digital money\n \n  getty \n  \n\n\n\nThe IRS has been working on digital asset compliance for years, but an infusion of funds could allow the agency to rather significantly step up its efforts, as well as its criminal investigations. \n\nThe IRS explained in a March fact sheet that \u201ctoday [the IRS Criminal Investigation division] currently devotes only about six percent of its investigative time to cybercrimes/crypto currency, so it is just scratching the surface of the amount of criminal activity that is being detected.\u201d\n\nThe next largest proposed line item is for operations support, which encompasses all the mundane elements of running a big federal agency, like rent, facilities costs, and vehicles, that generally don\u2019t affect taxpayers directly. \n\nBut H.R. 5376 specifies that the IRS can use this allocated amount for \u201cinformation technology development, enhancement, operations, maintenance, and security.\u201d \n\nThe IRS\u2019s technological woes are well documented and can have concrete effects on taxpayers, so this dedicated amount should help ameliorate some of those deficiencies. \n\nThe item for business systems modernization could have a similar salutary effect on customer service because the bill stipulates that it must be spent on \u201ctechnology to provide a more personalized customer service,\u201d and not used for the operation and maintenance of legacy systems. \n\nMost of the items on which H.R. 5376 instructs the IRS to spend its allocations give the agency until 2031 to incur the expense. Not so the allocation for a task force on developing an IRS-run free, direct e-file tax return system. \n\nUnder the bill, the IRS has nine months to set up a task force to produce a report on how it would create and operate a free, direct e-file system, including what the system would cost to administer. The details of what would be included in the system will presumably be part of the report, and those details will matter.\n\nOne item that H.R. 5376 contemplates is \u201cdifferential coverage based on taxpayer adjusted gross income and return complexity.\u201d Part of the report would feature \u201ctaxpayer opinions, exceptions, and level of trust, based on surveys, for such a free direct efile system,\u201d so there would be some consultation of taxpayers before any changes are implemented. \n\nThat\u2019s appropriate because, depending on its particulars, an IRS-run direct e-file system could represent a significant change in the relationship between taxpayers and the tax system. The H.R. 5376-authorized study would be a major development for tax administration, but it\u2019s not a novel idea \u2014 it was included in last year\u2019s Build Back Better Act.",

    "body": "Mourning and outrage continue\u00a0to reverberate across the nation following a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school\u00a0that killed 19 children and two teachers on Tuesday. And, amid a long history of gun violence in the United States, increased gun control legislation is still uncertain in Congress.\n\nThere are notably two gun bills that have been passed in the House, but not yet in the Senate: H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, both of which\u00a0would tighten gun sales regulations by\u00a0expanding background checks.\n\nThe Tuesday shooting in Uvalde, Texas, marks the deadliest shooting at a U.S. grade school since the 2012 attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nLive updates:Victims of deadly Texas school rampage were inside one classroom, official says; shaken community mourns\n\nIn the aftermath of horrific shootings in Uvalde, Buffalo and elsewhere, many Americans continue to call on Congress to take immediate action on gun control legislation.\n\n'Enough':Steve Kerr gives emotional speech after school shooting; LeBron James, more react\n\nPresident Joe Biden also called\u00a0on lawmakers to \u201cstand up to the gun lobby,\u201d and Vice President Kamala Harris said, \"As a nation, we have to have the courage to take action.\"\n\nWhat would House gun control bills H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 do? And what is the outlook for Senate votes? Here's what you need to know.\n\n'Enough is enough':Biden calls on lawmakers to take action after Uvalde school shooting\n\nH.R. 8, or\u00a0The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, would expand background checks on individuals seeking to purchase or transfer firearms \u2013 including for private individuals and groups, closing the \"Gun Show Loophole.\" The requirements would apply to online sales.\n\nWhile current federal law requires background checks only for licensed gun dealers, H.R. 8 would make it illegal for anyone who is not a licensed firearm importer, manufacturer or dealer to trade or sell firearms. Still, the legislation would not create a registry or other federal mechanisms for review.\n\nThe Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 is the current version of H.R. 8, which passed in March 2021.\u00a0The bill also previously passed in 2019, when Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif.,\u00a0originally introduced it. Both House votes received some bipartisan support.\n\nH.R. 8\u00a0did not receive a Senate vote in 2019.\u00a0Thompson reintroduced the legislation in 2021.\n\nAlso in March 2021, the House passed H.R. 1446, or the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021.\n\nH.R. 1446\u00a0would close the \"Charleston Loophole,\" a gap in federal law that lets gun sales proceed without a completed background check if three businesses days have passed. The legislation would extend\u00a0the initial background check review period to 10 business days \u2013 and, if that period elapsed,\u00a0require the purchaser to ask the FBI to complete its investigation before receiving authorization.\n\nH.R. 1446 is linked to a 2015 shooting\u00a0in Charleston, South Carolina, where a white supremacist obtained firearms through\u00a0the loophole and later killed nine Black people at Mother Emanuel AME Church.\n\nHouse Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., who introduced H.R. 1446, called the bill \"an important step Congress must take to address the epidemic of gun violence in this country.\"\n\nSimilar to H.R. 8, H.R. 1446 was previously passed in 2019 \u2013 but it stalled in the Senate, which was then under Republican control.\n\nMarch 2021:House passes bills to expand background checks for gun sales and close 'Charleston loophole'\n\nOn Wednesday, The U.S. Senate Periodical Press Gallery announced\u00a0that both H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 have been placed on the Senate's Legislative Calendar of Business. But it's currently\u00a0unclear when they will be brought to the chamber's floor.\n\nAlso on Wednesday,\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., signaled that he wouldn't bring a vote on gun control legislation this week, because he doesn't expect enough\u00a0Republican votes.\u00a0But Schumer said he would call for\u00a0a Thursday vote on a motion to proceed with the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act (H.R. 350), which the House passed last week following the mass shooting in Buffalo.\n\n\"We are going to vote on gun legislation. The American people are tired of moments of silence,\" Schumer said on Wednesday. \"We can use the domestic terrorism bill tomorrow to begin \u2026\u00a0considering gun safety amendments.\"\n\nSchumer's plea to GOP:Be in 'shoes of these parents'\n\nThe future of both H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446\u00a0remains uncertain, particularly because of the projected lack of\u00a0Republican votes. In the House, both bills received some bipartisan support, but\u00a0it's unlikely that the Senate will reach the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster \u2013 as most Senate Republicans have historically not supported the increased gun control legislation.\n\nWhen Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., requested unanimous consent for the Senate to vote on H.R. 8 last December following a school shooting in Michigan, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, objected.\n\n\"This bill is hostile toward lawful gun owners and lawful firearm transactions,\" Grassley said in December. \"So-called universal background checks will not prevent crime and will turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals.\u201d\n\nIn the hours following the\u00a0Tuesday shooting in Uvalde, House members called on the Senate to act.\n\n\"Our work is in saving lives, but the Senate\u2019s inaction is failing. No excuses. Abolish the filibuster and pass meaningful gun legislation. Now,\" Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"The House has taken a significant step to curb gun violence by passing a bill to require background checks,\" Thompson wrote. \"Senate Republicans need to stop playing politics with the lives of our children \u2013 every day that they wait, more people die. That\u2019s unacceptable.\"\n\nMurphy also delivered a powerful speech to his colleagues on Tuesday.\n\n\"What are we doing?\" Murphy\u00a0asked. \"Why do you spend all this time running for the United States Senate? Why do you go through all the hassle of getting this job, of putting yourself in a position of authority, if your answer is that as the slaughter increases, as our kids run for their lives, we do nothing?\"\n\n'What are we doing?':Sen.

    "body": "The 118th Congress has reached a milestone of seeing 50 bills and resolutions that have been introduced so far which cover the crypto regulatory landscape in a variety of ways. The number of bills does not even include draft legislation on stablecoins from either Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) or Representative Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), nor a much-discussed but not yet public bill that would cover the entire digital asset regulatory sphere from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). \n\n\nThese numbers may be eye-popping but by no means surprising. The amount of legislation currently introduced in Congress reflects the passing of the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act that became law in 2021, representing the first time a new law that directly impacted the crypto industry was passed. With the surge in the crypto markets that continued after that bill became law last year up until the recent crash, much has also been reported in the media regarding a surge of crypto lobbying efforts as well as attempts to influence politicians with significant campaign fundraising as well. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the types of policy impacts that digital assets touches from foreign relations, monetary policy, consumer protection, and interpretations over how digital assets are considered, whether as securities or commodities for the industry has broadened attention among a larger pool of policymakers. Combine multiple policy impacts with emerging technologies such as decentralized finance and NFTs, makes the exploration of new legislation for the industry a fascinating and complex path for D.C. policymakers. \n\n\nNot only is the innovative technologies of digital assets and distributed ledger technologies disruptive, but also has created new policy scenarios such as ransomware where Bitcoin is requested as payment and sanctions when Ukraine has been able to leverage crypto donations to benefit both its military and aid in the humanitarian crisis of war, while the U.S. seeks to sanction Russia and not allow cryptocurrency to be used as a back door to their efforts. \n\n\n\nBased on research completed at the Value Technology Foundation (VT \n  \n  VT \n F), a 501(c)(3), the 50 bills identified are broken into six different categories. The categories include crypto taxation, central bank digital currency (CBDC), crypto clarity on regulatory treatment of digital assets and digital asset securities, supporting blockchain technology, and issues of sanctions, ransomware, and implications involving either China or Russia\u2019s use of blockchain or cryptocurrency, and access and limitations on use of crypto by U.S. elected officials. Below is a discussion of the first three categories, which will be followed up with a Part II overview on the remaining three categories tomorrow.\n\n\nI. Crypto Taxation \n\n \n  \n  \n   \n   WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 09: Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) speaks during a news conference with Sen. Pat ... [+] Toomey (R-PA) on bipartisan agreement to fix the digital asset reporting requirements in the infrastructure bill while looks on, on Capitol Hill on Monday, Aug. 9, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Times via Getty Images \n  \n\n\nH.R. 3684 became public law on November 15, 2021, and is required to be implemented in terms of the crypto tax reporting requirements by January 1, 2023. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided a definition of digital assets and created a new definition for a \u2018broker\u2019 as the IRS would consider someone for purposes of required tax reporting, as, \u201c...any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\nThe crypto industry took exception as to how this wording could potentially include cryptocurrency miners, stakers, and programmers, who would not have access as a cryptocurrency exchange would to the information necessary to report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and be in compliance with the law. While the U.S. Treasury is promulgating how the industry will need to comply, there have been no less than five bills introduced in an attempt to modify or reverse the impact of the legislation. \n\n\n\nSenator Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced S. 3249, a bipartisan bill with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), in an attempt to change to language that had been agreed upon for the original bill; however due to the ways Amendments were permitted to be introduced during the debate on the Senate floor, the language was prevented from making its way into the final text. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) sought with the introduction of S. 3206 to repeal the provisions of H.R. 3684 entirely. \n\nIn the House of Representatives, Representative Patrick McHenry (R-NC) sought with the Keep Innovation In America Act (H.R. 6006) to \u201c...expand the definition of broker, for purposes of tax information reporting, to include any person who (for consideration) stands ready in the ordinary course of a trade or business to effect sales of digital assets at the direction of their customers.\u201d This new definition on who is a broker would clarify the language and is a bipartisan bill with 19 co-sponsors in the House, with Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH) leading on the Democratic side. Congressman Darren Soto (D-FL) also made two attempts to help clarify the language in the bill with H.R. 5082, the Cryptocurrency Tax Clarity Act, and H.R. 5083, the Cryptocurrency Tax Reform Act. \n\nAside from what is now Public Law 117-58 and the bills described to change the way tax reporting is handled for digital assets, Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) had introduced previously the Safe Harbor For Taxpayers With Forked Assets Act of 2021 (H.R. 3273) which would exclude from gross income, for income tax purposes, any amount received as forked convertible virtual currency. It also would establish a safe harbor period to suspend any penalties to a taxpayer who receives a forked convertible virtual currency until the IRS issues regulations or guidance, or legislation is enacted, to make clear what is required. Congresswoman Susan K. Delbene (D-WA) with Congressman David Schweikert (R-AZ) introduced the bipartisan Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2022 (H.R. 6582) that would exempt personal transactions made with virtual currency when the gains are $200 or less. Delbene stated that not having a de minimus exemption, \u201c...makes the everyday use of virtual currency near impossible, discouraging people from using it and inhibiting the growth of our digital economy.\u201d \n\nII. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Bills \n\n \n  \n  \n   \n   UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 16: Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill., walks down the House steps at the Capitol ... [+] following passage of tax reform on Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)\n \n   \n  CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images \n  \n\nThe Central Bank Digital Currency Study Act of 2021 (H.R. 2211) was introduced by Congressman French Hill (R-AR) with Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL), who were the original Representatives that prodded the Federal Reserve about the potential need for a CBDC. This bill would require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, (Fed) in consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to study the impact of the introduction of a CBDC. The Report would focus on inclusion, accessibility, safety, privacy, convenience, speed, and price considerations for individuals and small businesses, impacts to monetary policy and systemic risks to the global financial system, among others. The Executive Order on Digital Assets issued by President Biden on March 9th captures many of the considerations in this bill by making the study of and potential implementation of a CBDC as urgent. \n\nThe 21st Century Dollar Act (H.R. 3506) was also sponsored by Hill and co-sponsored by Congressman Jim Himes (D-CT) where a holistic approach to how to keep the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency is presented, which of course does include the idea of a CBDC. The Automatic Boost to Communities Act (H.R. 1030) would require that as part of stimulus payments during Covid-19, a form of payment in a new \u2018digital dollar\u2019 would be made available, including the ability to use a digital dollar wallet to receive the funds. Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced (S. 2543), a bill with nine co-sponsors in the Senate that seeks to study in depth the national security implications of China creating a CBDC of its own, which is commonly known as e-CNY. \n\nEmmer introduced H.R. 6415 in the House, which Cruz introduced as a companion bill in the Senate (S. 3954) that limits how the Fed can interact with the American public with respect to any new CBDC that may be introduced. The bill says, \u201c... a Federal reserve bank may not offer products or services directly to an individual, maintain an account on behalf of an individual, or issue a central bank digital currency directly to an individual.\u201d Meanwhile, the E-Cash Act (H.R. 7231) was introduced by Representative Stephen Lynch (D-MA) that focuses the U.S. Treasury on creating a digital dollar to replicate cash that diverts from the notion of a CBDC that would be created by the Federal Reserve. \n\nThis Congress also saw for the first time a CBDC introduced based on an existing digital asset, in this case bitcoin in El Salvador. With El Salvador making the digital currency legal tender, Senator James Risch (R-ID) and Senator Ed Menendez (D-NJ), the Ranking Member and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee respectively, introduced the Accountability for Cryptocurrency In El Salvador Act (ACES) Act (S. 3666). This bill expressed concern about the decision of El Salvador to take such a step in its monetary policy and would prompt the U.S. Department of State to study a variety of potential implications to the U.S. and the global financial system. \n\nIII. Clarity on Regulatory Treatment of Digital Assets and Digital Asset Securities\n\nThe Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (H.R. 5045) was introduced by Emmer and offers protection for \u2018non-controlling\u2019 block\u00adchain services And software developers. This would prevent any blockchain developer or provider of a blockchain service from being treated as a money transmitter or financial institution unless, \u201c...the developer or provider has, in the regular course of business, control over digital currency to which a user is entitled under the blockchain service or the software created, maintained, or disseminated by the blockchain developer.\u201d \n\nThe Token Taxonomy Act (H.R. 1628) as introduced by Representative Warren Davidson (R-NC) sought to address the challenges the SEC has had in providing clear guidance around what are digital asset securities and digital assets. McHenry introduced the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act of 2021 (H.R.5496) that would make into law a safe harbor for tokens that had originally been introduced by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. \n\nThe Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act (H.R. 4741) was introduced by Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA) soon after the Infrastructure Act became law that covered regulations for the entire digital asset industry. The Securities Clarity Act (H.R. 4451) was introduced by Emmer that sought to clarify that, \u201c...an investment contract asset (for example, a digital token) is separate and distinct from the securities offering that it may have been a part of.\u201d The approach of the Securities Clarity Act was technology-neutral, and applies equally to all assets offered and sold, whether tangible or digital. The Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021 (H.R. 1602) sponsored by McHenry, was bipartisan and co-sponsored by Lynch. The bill passed the House of Representatives and sought to create a SEC and CFTC working group to help provide regulatory clarity to digital assets. \n\nSoto introduced two bipartisan bills including the U.S. Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act of 2021 (H.R. 5100) that directs the CFTC to describe how price manipulation could happen in virtual markets and make recommendations for regulatory changes to improve the CFTC's price manipulation prevention procedure. The Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act of 2021 (H.R. 5101) would direct the CFTC to report on virtual currency markets and U.S. competitiveness. In addition, the Digital Taxonomy Act (H.R. 3638) would direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to report to Congress on actions related to digital tokens. Parts of the Digital Taxonomy Act were included in the Consumer Safety Technology Act (H.R. 3723) that passed out of the House of Representatives. \n\nA follow-up story will be published tomorrow that will include a discussion of bills introduced to support blockchain technology, bills addressing issues of sanctions and ransomware, and access and limitations on use of digital assets by U.S. elected officials. The full report on the legislation for the 118th Congress will be released later this year and available on www.valuetechnology.org.",

    "body": "Now, Biden's never-ending quest for power has taken a new, dark turn: With their new elections bill, H.R. 4 , Democrats are trying to control how individual states run their local elections. States are frequently referred to as \"laboratories of democracy.\" And yet Democrats want to eviscerate their autonomy and force local leaders to ask the federal government for permission to pass commonsense election integrity legislation. It's totalitarian, and as usual with the left, it's all about power. H.R. 4 is a bad bill, and it would be bad law. Its central proposition is to revive an outdated policy known as \"preclearance.\" Preclearance is an obscure legal mechanism that would force individual states to seek approval from the Department of Justice before making any changes to their own election laws, including widely supported changes such as voter ID requirements. This is the same Department of Justice that recently took the stunning step of suing Georgia for passing election integrity legislation. Democrats are attempting to revive a rule from the 1960s to influence elections - and it bears mentioning that this rule was deemed unconstitutional in a 2013 Supreme Court case . The left is so desperate to control local elections that they're going back in time and against the Constitution. Does that seem a little shady and overly complicated? That's the point: They're hoping they can sneak one by the American people. They have realized that openly calling for bans on voter ID won't work - and that's why so many prominent Democrats have flip-flopped on that issue. They learned something from the failed Texas Democrats' laughable vacation to Washington. Their extreme positions and attention-seeking antics aren't getting results with the American people, so instead Democrats are trying to hide their power-grabs behind obscure sections of outdated laws. The danger of H.R. 4 isn't solely limited to its push for preclearance. The bill contains several other typical Democratic attacks on election integrity. These include efforts to make cleaning up voter rolls more difficult, as well as forcing states to take inaccurate census data. The bill would subject strict state-level voter ID laws to partisan federal review. None of this is necessary, and all of it is about power. Democrats don't care that the reforms they're pushing are not popular with the American people. In fact, polling shows that 68 percent of voters believe state legislatures should decide the voting rules and regulations for their state, not the federal government. That number alone invalidates their reasoning for H.R. 4's necessity. Polling also shows strong support for voter ID across the board - including from a majority of Democrats and minority voters. Democrats in D.C. evidently care more about expanding their influence on local elections than they do about the will of their constituents. Democrats are revealing their true intentions, and Americans ought to pay attention. This far-left party has no interest in promoting safe, secure, transparent elections. They don't care that Americans support commonsense fixes to the voting process. Democrats find the concept of local leaders passing legislation without the approval of D.C. bureaucrats inherently offensive. Joe Biden thinks that the federal government should play a massive role in your day-to-day life - especially when it comes to how you cast your ballot. Americans will reject H.R. 4 just like they rejected H.R. 1 because freedom still matters. Ronna McDaniel is chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. Follow her on Twitter @GOPChairwoman",

But there now are, at last, signs of a dawning realization that this is not good legislation.\n\nOver the weekend, the Daily Beast posted an article by Jessica Huseman of Votebeat, a nonprofit news group covering electoral issues. She calls H.R.1\u2019s tenets \u201claudable\u201d but says the bill \u201cwas written with apparently no consultation with election administrators, and it shows.\u201d An unnamed Democratic state-level official is quoted as saying that he\u2019d follow the law: \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019s not going to be a total clusterf\u2014 the first election.\u201d\n\nMs. Huseman knocks H.R.1\u2019s \u201calarmingly prescriptive solutions,\u201d its \u201cdeeply unrealistic time frames,\u201d and its added costs with \u201cno assured long-term funding.\u201d How\u2019s this for reportorial color? \u201cElection administrators used the F-word a lot during my chats with them,\u201d she writes, \u201cfrustrated because they\u2019ve eagerly sought federal funding and basic attention to their offices, only to be handed impossible goals.\u201d\n\nThese columns have reported some of H.R.1\u2019s flaws already, but Ms. Huseman points out two hilarious provisions we hadn\u2019t explored. The bill requires states to offer voter registration via \u201can automated telephone-based system.\u201d She calls this \u201ca wild, almost certainly nonsecure idea that no state currently uses and that election officials are baffled by.\u201d Some of her sources suggest it was added to the bill at the demand of disability advocates.\n\nH.R.1 also tells states to accompany mail ballots and applications with \u201ca self-sealing return envelope.\u201d Ms. Huseman: \u201cThese envelopes are about 30 percent more expensive than the envelopes currently in use for ballots, and their glue gums up the USPS\u2019s machines\u2014making voting more expensive and less efficient. It\u2019s not clear what would justify such a change, as even the most disadvantaged voters have access to their own spit.\u201d",

It\u2019s revealing that Speaker Nancy\u2019s Pelosi\u2019s first legislative priority is cementing Democratic political power.\n\nLast week House Democrats reintroduced as H.R.1 a voting and campaign-finance bill that would grease the Democratic voting machine nationwide and restrict political opposition. They also introduced a bill to provide statehood for the District of Columbia that would guarantee Democrats two new Senate seats.\n\nH.R.1 imposes California-style election rules nationwide. The bill requires every state to register voters based on names in state and federal databases\u2014such as anyone receiving food stamps or who interacts with a state DMV. It mandates same-day and online voter registration, expands mail and early voting, and limits states\u2019 ability to remove voters from rolls. Overall the bill is designed to auto-enroll likely Democratic voters, enhance Democratic turnout, with no concern for ballot integrity.\n\nThe bill also strips state legislatures of their role in drawing congressional districts, replacing them with commissions that are ostensibly independent. In practice commissions have turned out mostly to favor Democrats, as in New Jersey and California. If states want such commissions, so be it. But this is an attempt to impose one Pelosi standard from coast to coast.\n\nH.R.1\u2019s campaign-finance provisions would also limit the political speech of conservatives and Republicans. The bill requires some nonprofits to disclose publicly the names of donors who give more than $10,000, even if those groups aren\u2019t taking part in candidate elections. The left\u2019s pressure groups and media will then stigmatize donors. The bill also raises disclosure requirements for political ads on radio and TV, requiring the head of an organization to approve messages and list the group\u2019s top donors by name.",

Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), illustrates the concern among a handful of more moderate lawmakers about the far-reaching measure to lower drug prices, known as H.R. 3, that House Democratic leaders have included in their $3.5 trillion package now moving through committees. A summary of Peters and Schrader's bill states that it would \"preserve innovation\" from drug companies. The pharmaceutical industry has attacked H.R. 3 as threatening innovation. The summary also states that it has policies with \"bipartisan support,\" in addition to lowering drug prices. The measure is also cosponsored by centrist Reps. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) and Lou Correa (D-Calif.). The bill was first reported on Friday by The Wall Street Journal While the new rival bill highlights the concerns of some moderates in the House with H.R. 3, that legislation was already widely expected to be altered before the final version of the bill, given the need to satisfy Senate Democratic moderates. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is working on alternative legislation that is expected to be less far-reaching, though that measure is not finalized. The center of H.R. 3 is allowing the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices, with a cap on prices based on what other wealthy countries pay for drugs. The Peters-Schrader bill allows negotiation only in much narrower circumstances, when older drugs in a certain part of Medicare, known as Part B, no longer are protected by exclusivity but still do not face competition. The bill also includes other measures, like capping what seniors in Medicare must pay out of pocket for drugs, that have wide support and are included in some form in H.R. 3 as well.

Down the road, this means more ailments and earlier deaths for everyday Americans. In other words, just another day at the office for Democrats.\u00a0\nH.R. 3 would force pharmaceutical manufacturers to haggle over prices with federal functionaries.\u00a0But this is not the bargaining between buyers and sellers that occurs daily across America. H.R. 3 defines\u00a0\"negotiation\"\u00a0as Washington bureaucrats dictating an amount that they feel like paying for a drug, based on overseas price controls mandated via socialized medicine. Those fixed prices would regulate all sales \u2013 to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers.\u00a0\nAnd what if a drug company resists this new policy? That's when federal extortion kicks in.\u00a0\nPharmaceutical firms that will not swallow Uncle Sam's prices would face taxes on gross revenues (not net profits) that\u00a0start\u00a0at 65 percent. But that tribute rises every 90 days that any such enterprise refuses to be bludgeoned.

CBO forecasts that \"Negotiations would reduce prices by 57 percent to 75 percent, relative to current prices.\" Of course, even a 75 percent sales drop beats a 95 percent cut.

Vance reacts on 'Fox  Friends.'\n\n\n\n\nThe 2020 election was a pivotal moment for the United States and election security. The election exposed several concerning issues in both congressional races and the presidential election. My race for New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District\u202fwas not certified for almost 100 days after New Yorkers cast their votes in November. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s clear that our nation needs commonsense reforms to ensure fair, accurate and transparent elections and restore confidence.\u202f\u00a0\nIn March, House Democrats passed H.R. 1, the so-called For the People Act. This partisan bill is an unconstitutional power grab that would codify some of these worst policies from the 2020 election while also opening the floodgates for almost anyone, including ineligible votes, to be counted. \u00a0\nDAVID MARCUS: AOC IS THE ONLY HONEST DEMOCRAT ON THE BORDER CRISIS\nH.R. 1 would ban commonsense voter ID laws from being enacted, permit convicted non-citizens and felons to vote, give away taxpayer dollars to fund campaigns, and dramatically expand automatic voter registration \u2013 a giveaway to political operatives seeking to boost their ballot harvesting operations. \u00a0\nThis bill would be a disaster for election integrity.\u202fH.R. 1 isn\u2019t for the people, it\u2019s for the politicians.\u202f\u00a0\n\nFortunately, H.R. 1 has hit a wall in the Senate. Its passage depended on every Democrat supporting it, in addition to at least 10 Republicans. But just last week, Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, announced he would oppose the bill, dealing it a final blow.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith H.R. 1\u2019s prospects fading, Democrats, including Manchin, are shifting their attention to H.R.4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. But don\u2019t be fooled, H.R. 4 is just as bad as the For the People Act. \u00a0\nThis substitute legislation is yet another highly partisan bill. It masquerades as a cure to end racial discrimination, but instead, centralizes election control in the federal government and, in effect, enacts the worst aspects of H.R. 1.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Democrats are attempting to pull a bait and switch on the American people. H.R. 4, like H.R. 1, would federalize our election system, give more power to unelected career bureaucrats in Washington, and unconstitutionally erode the ability of states to oversee and administer elections.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Democrats\u2019 attempt to pass H.R. 4 and overturn\u202fShelby v. Holder\u202fis clearly unconstitutional and merely a justification for Democrats to claw back power from states.\n The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would require states to seek permission from the federal government before making even minor changes to election rules. The smallest change, such as simply moving a polling place across the street, would require permission from career bureaucrats at the Department of Justice (DOJ). President Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and unelected officials at the DOJ would have the power to overrule good-faith decisions made by state and local governments without any justification.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThis would effect changes to voter ID laws, signature matching, absentee voting, maintenance of voter rolls, and the location of polling places.\u202f\u00a0\nFurthermore, H.R. 4 would create an even more onerous formula for determining discrimination in voting rights than the one employed by the original Voting Rights Act. The bill would attempt to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in\u202fShelby v. Holder, which struck down the formula for Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\u00a0\nSection 5 was adopted in 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act became law. It required states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to receive pre-approval from the DOJ before making any changes to their election laws. \u00a0\nHowever, since the 1960s, states have made great progress eradicating inequities in election laws. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled Section 5 was no longer necessary because of the reforms and elimination of race-based election laws.\u202f\u00a0\nYet Democrats persist in claiming that our current system suppresses minority voters, and that new legislation is needed to provide the federal government veto power, as was outlined in the Voting Rights Act. But this is just false. \u00a0\nIn April 2021, the Census Bureau\u202fconcluded that the 2020 election attracted \"the highest voter turnout of the 21st\u202fcentury.\" The census also found that minority groups registered and turned out to vote in the highest numbers ever in our history.\u00a0\nThe Democrats\u2019 attempt to pass H.R. 4 and overturn\u202fShelby v. Holder\u202fis clearly unconstitutional and merely a justification for Democrats to claw back power from states. This legislation violates the principles of federalism and exceeds the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThe pandemic last year magnified the irregularities experienced in elections across the nation. Commonsense reforms are needed to restore voter integrity and to ensure that every legal vote counts. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act would only aggravate the chaos of the 2020 elections and undermine the integrity of our election system.\u202f\u00a0\nThat is why I will continue to work tirelessly as co-chair of the Congressional Election Integrity Caucus to foster meaningful discussions on election reforms and drive principled policy solutions that safeguard our sacred right to vote.\u202f\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

It\u2019s intentional.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli noted that H.R. 1, dubbed the For the People Act, would automatically register adult non-citizens from state databases \u2014 including but not limited to state motor vehicle and public health departments \u2014 as voters if enacted as law.\n\n\u201cOne of the aspects of [H.R. 1] is that it requires \u2014 it\u00a0mandates \u2014 that states put every adult \u2014 \u2018individual\u2019 is the word used in the bill, not \u2018citizen\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s in their state databases \u2026 into their voter registration database, in other words, to register them to vote automatically,\u201d he remarked.\n\nHe continued, \u201cNon-citizens who are here legally and illegal aliens alike come into contact with all of our state and local government agencies. That happens quite regularly, all the time, and so all of those people will be swept onto the voter rolls under H.R. 1. The other side would say, \u2018Well, no. He\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t make it legal for non-citizens to vote.\u2019\u00a0Technically, that\u2019s true, but they eliminate the penalty for it. You heard that right, no penalty for committing an alleged crime, and they sweep them all under the voter rolls. That tells you that\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli elaborated on Democrats\u2019 plan to automatically register non-citizens on voting rolls with H.R. 1. In a column published at RealClearPolitics, he wrote:\n\nThere are several dangerous provisions of H.R. 1 \u2013 and its Senate counterpart, S. 1 \u2013 that will force states to register many of the illegal aliens now crossing our border to vote.\u00a0Under H.R. 1, the federal government would require every state to automatically register to vote every adult that comes into contact with a state agency.\u00a0\u00a0That requirement would hold whether it\u2019s the DMV giving out driver\u2019s licenses or I.D.s, the public health department delivering vaccines, or the local government delivering a zoning permit or welfare benefits. Sweeping in everyone that comes in contact with a state agency, while also threatening a huge federal criminal penalty for state and local government officials if they dare to clarify someone\u2019s status as part of the registration process, will guarantee that millions of non-citizens, including illegal aliens, are placed on our voter rolls.\n\nCuccinelli determined, \u201c[Democrats] believe these are future votes, including before they are citizens, mind you. They will vote illegally, and that is the expectation under the radical left\u2019s\u00a0H.R. 1 bill, and they\u2019ll vote Democrat. That\u2019s their presumption.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThat\u2019s the only conclusion you can draw from something like H.R. 1. There\u2019s no other conclusion if you think everything was put there thoughtfully and purposefully, except to conclude that they are trying intentionally to throw the door open to massive cheating.\u201d",

    "body": "To protect innocent Americans from \u201clawless\u201d police seizures, Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Tim Walberg (R-MI) reintroduced a bill on March 9 that would significantly overhaul the federal government\u2019s civil forfeiture laws. Civil forfeiture lets the government seize and keep valuable property without ever convicting the owner of a crime or even filing criminal charges. And under federal law, innocent owners who want to reclaim their seized property must prove they weren\u2019t involved in any wrongdoing, flipping the presumption of innocence straight on its head.\n\nIn a bitterly divided political landscape, the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act (H.R. 1525) is a refreshing display of bipartisanship, receiving an equal number of Democratic and Republican co-sponsors.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 13: Storm clouds fill the sky over the U.S. Capitol Building, June 13, 2013 ... [+] in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\n\u201cSeizing property and handing it over to the government without proof of wrongdoing is fundamentally un-American,\u201d said Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D-CA), one of the original co-sponsors for the FAIR Act. \u201cIn the United States, we are innocent until proven guilty, and the government may not seize our property without just cause. It\u2019s past time to reform our civil asset forfeiture system and make it fairer for the American people.\u201d\n\nFirst, H.R. 1525 would eliminate the most abusive type of civil forfeiture: administrative or \u201cnonjudicial\u201d forfeiture, which somehow manages to have even fewer protections. Instead of an independent, neutral judge hearing the case, under administrative forfeiture, the seizing agencies themselves decide whether to forfeit the property. That is a blatant conflict of interest, especially since federal law lets agencies keep up to 100% percent of the proceeds from forfeited property.\n\nIf an owner fails to file a claim quickly enough, that triggers a \u201cdefault judgment,\u201d with the seized property automatically forfeited to the federal government. Aside from real estate and assets valued at more than $500,000, almost any property can be taken through nonjudicial forfeiture.\n\nGiven such a stacked deck, it\u2019s no surprise that federal agencies overwhelmingly prefer administrative forfeiture. According to a report by the Institute for Justice, 78% of all forfeiture cases processed by the U.S. Department of Justice were administrative. In other words, barely a fifth of the Justice Department\u2019s forfeiture cases actually involved some level of judicial oversight.\n\nRates are even more abysmal for other federal departments. At the Treasury Department and the Department of Homeland Security, administrative forfeiture accounted for 96% and 98.6% of their entire forfeiture caseloads respectively. By only allowing forfeiture to occur \u201cthrough judicial process,\u201d the FAIR Act would effectively end the legal shortcut used to process almost all civil forfeiture cases on the federal level.\n\n\u201cInnocent until proven guilty has little meaning if law enforcement can seize your assets before you ever appear in a court on a criminal charge,\u201d noted Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), who also co-sponsored the FAIR Act.\n\nIn addition to requiring actual judges to hear forfeiture cases, the bill would add multiple new safeguards to further protect due process. The FAIR Act would squarely place the burden of proof onto the federal government\u2014where it belongs\u2014and also require \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that a seized property was linked to criminal activity. Currently, federal agencies can permanently confiscate property based on a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d i.e., more likely than not, a much lower standard of proof.\n\nSince many property owners do not have the means to fight an expensive legal battle to reclaim what was taken, the FAIR Act would also guarantee legal representation to those who cannot afford it.\n\nCritically, H.R. 1525 would eliminate the financial incentives that drive so many forfeiture cases. If enacted, any and all forfeiture proceeds would be directed away from the coffers of federal agencies and instead deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. Since 2000, the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department have forfeited well over $50 billion.\n\nMoreover, the FAIR Act would curtail many abusive seizures conducted on the state and local level by ending a federal program known as \u201cequitable sharing.\u201d Under equitable sharing, state and local law enforcement agencies can partner with the federal government, forfeit property under federal law and then keep up to 80% of the proceeds.\n\nIn other words, equitable sharing rewards police and prosecutors who bypass stricter limits on civil forfeiture set by state laws. And the program can be incredibly lucrative. Over the past two decades, the federal government has paid out more than $8.8 billion in equitable sharing funding to state and local agencies.\n\nMarine veteran Stephen Lara encountered this first-hand. While driving to California to see his two kids in February 2021, Stephen was pulled over by the then Nevada Highway Patrol. Even though carrying cash and distrusting banks are not crimes, troopers seized his entire life savings\u2014nearly $87,000. It took Stephen over 20 years to scrimp and save that money, including during tours of duty he served in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nStephen was never charged with a crime. Officers didn\u2019t even write him a traffic ticket.\n\nAfter taking Stephen\u2019s money, Nevada state troopers kicked his case over to the DEA to proceed through equitable sharing. Since Nevada requires clear and convincing evidence to forfeit property in civil court, it would be easier for the agencies to win under federal law.\n\nFortunately, after the Institute for Justice filed a lawsuit on Stephen\u2019s behalf and sparked a national firestorm, the DEA agreed to return Stephen\u2019s money in October 2021. His lawsuit against the Nevada State Police is still ongoing.\n\nAlthough equitable sharing was initially pitched as a way to fight crime, after analyzing clearance rates across thousands of different agencies, a study by the Institute for Justice concluded that \u201cmore equitable sharing funds do not translate into more crimes solved.\u201d But there was evidence that \u201cduring periods of fiscal stress,\u201d police were using forfeiture to \u201craise revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtecting Americans\u2019 property rights isn\u2019t a partisan issue and we\u2019re glad to see lawmakers from across the aisle working together to pass true reforms,\u201d said Institute for Justice Senior Attorney Dan Alban, who heads IJ\u2019s National Initiative to End Forfeiture Abuse.",

House Speaker Nancy\u00a0Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck\u00a0Schumer, D-N.Y., believe they know better.\u00a0\nIn introducing H.R. 4, Pelosi referenced both Arizona\u2019s legislative efforts to ensure the integrity of its elections and Brnovich v. DNC as a catalyst for the bill\u2019s re-introduction. Pelosi and her misguided allies in Congress have their sights locked on overriding any state-led resistance to their charge toward the nationalization of our elections. \u00a0\nThe Democrats see these bills\u00a0as an opportunity to centralize the power of the ballot box in the D.C. swamp, where one political party, not individual state legislatures, can determine what is best for the entire nation.\u00a0\u00a0\nAmericans should be very alarmed about any potential success for these power-grabbing endeavors.

They also favor prohibiting former executive branch officials from ever lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.\n COLLEGE PARK, Md. Dec. 14, 2022\n  The public consultation survey of 2,606 registered voters was conducted by the at the University of Maryland (PPC). Bipartisan support for these proposals has remained steady since PPC's first public consultation survey on lobbying policies in 2017.\n  To ensure that respondents understood the issue, they were given a short briefing on the proposal and asked to evaluate arguments for and against. The content was reviewed by Congressional proponents and opponents of the legislation to ensure that the briefing was accurate and balanced and that the arguments presented were the strongest ones being made.\n  Currently, former Members of Congress are prohibited from lobbying Congress for two years after leaving office. Sixty-five percent of respondents (Republicans 65%, Democrats 67%) favored a proposal in current legislation that calls for extending this period to five years: Public Service Integrity Act (H.R. 414) by Rep. Posey (R) and the Cleaning up Washington Act (S. 751) by Sen. Tester (D). 32% favored going further and prohibiting Members from lobbying for life (BLAST Act, H.R. 1412 and S. 546).\n  Extending the waiting period for senior Congressional staffers from the current one year to two years\u2014as called for in H.R. 414 by Rep. Posey (R) \u2013 was favored by 74%, including three quarters of both Republicans and Democrats.\n  Currently, senior executive branch officials are prohibited from lobbying their former agency for 1-2 years depending on how senior they were. Seventy-one percent (72% of both Republicans and Democrats) favored extending this period to five years as called for in the Cleaning up Washington Act (S. 751) sponsored by Sen. Jon Tester (D).",

Senate Votes  MALTA AMBASSADOR: The Senate confirmed the nomination of Constance J. Milstein to be the U.S. ambassador to Malta. Milstein, currently an executive at Ogden CAP Properties, a New York City real estate company, was an aide to the Army secretary in the Obama administration. The vote, on Aug. 6, was 57 yeas to 34 nays.  Yea: Manchin  Nay: Capito  IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CLAIMS: The Senate rejected a motion to waive a point of order applied to an amendment sponsored by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376). The amendment would have required the Surgeon General to develop a plan for handling changes in immigration levels that would result from ending a suspension of asylum claims due to the federal government's declared COVID emergency. The vote, on Aug. 6, was 56 yeas to 44 nays, with a three-fifths majority required for approval.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  TAXPAYER AUDITS: The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376), that would have barred the Internal Revenue Service from using the bill's increase in agency funding to audit taxpayers with annual taxable incomes below $400 thousand. Crapo said in the absence of such a limitation, \"supersized IRS funding will squeeze billions from the middle-class workers and small businesses through ramped-up audits.\" An opponent, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said: \"Billionaires often have little or no taxable income for years on end. So under this amendment, the billionaires who live off their borrowings would be immune from audit.\" The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st nay vote.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  DRUG PRICES: The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would have excluded certain Medicare Part D prescription drugs and breakthrough therapy drugs from the bill's drug pricing provisions. Marshall said the exclusion would promote the development of \"new innovative drugs for life-threatening illnesses, like Alzheimer's and cancers.\" An opponent, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said it \"would water down the new negotiations program, so it would be harder to negotiate over the most expensive drugs in Medicare today.\" The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st nay vote.  Story continues  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  ENERGY PROJECT PERMITS: The Senate rejected a motion to waive a budgetary point of order against an amendment sponsored by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376). The amendment would have streamlined permitting for infrastructure and energy projects such as natural gas pipelines. Capito said faster project reviews would ease \"inflation, permitting, and energy supply challenges\" that are hurting the U.S. An amendment opponent, Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said it \"would undermine protection of our water quality, weaken air quality protections, harm wildlife, and would have significant impacts on vulnerable communities.\" The vote, on Aug. 7, was 49 yeas to 50 nays.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  OFFSHORE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION: The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would have required the Interior Department to hold at least 10 sales of leases, over the next 5 years, to produce oil and natural gas in offshore waters that are part of the Outer Continental Shelf. The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st nay vote.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  EXPANDED IRS: The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would have removed the bill's increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service. Cruz called the increase a \"terrible idea\" that would \"make the IRS larger than the Pentagon, the State Department, the FBI, and the Border Patrol all combined.\" An opponent, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the new staffers were needed to ensure that \"wealthy tax cheats\" do not \"get away with breaking the law scot-free.\" The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st nay vote.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  INSULIN SUBSIDIES: The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would have reinstated a federal government rule, repealed by the Biden administration, to authorize health centers funded by the government to provide deeply discounted supplies of insulin and epinephrine to patients at the centers. Kennedy said the rule \"would substantially and dramatically lower the cost of insulin for millions of Americans.\" An opponent, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called the amendment part of a Republican effort to derail the attempt to pass the underlying bill. The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st nay vote.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  BORDER SECURITY: The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would have provided $500 million for building pedestrian fencing and barriers on the border with Mexico. Sullivan said the spending was needed to prevent \"crime; victims of human trafficking, many of them children; a fentanyl epidemic killing our young people; chaos \u2014 all fueled by a lawless border.\" An opponent, Sen. Gary C. Peters, D-Mich., said the offsetting cut in spending at the Homeland Security Department would derail an effort to protect government workers from harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with vice president Harris casting a 51st nay vote.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  SMALL BUSINESS TAXES: The Senate passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would exempt aggregations of businesses that are owned by a single entity from the bill's minimum corporate book tax, and extend by 1 year a cap on the allowable state and local tax deduction for federal income tax payers. Thune said the amendment would \"help ensure our nation's small- and medium-size businesses aren't hit with a misguided and entirely inappropriate $35 billion tax hike.\" An opponent, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said \"there are no tax increases on small businesses in our bill.\" The vote, on Aug. 7, was 57 yeas to 43 nays.  Nay: Manchin  Yea: Capito  BUSINESS TAXES: The Senate passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., to a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376) that would strike the 1-year extension of a cap on the allowable state and local tax deduction for federal income tax payers and replace it with a 2-year extension of the cap on excess business losses. Warner said the amendment \"will allow us to move forward on this historic legislation.\" An opponent, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the 1-year extension he had proposed in a separate amendment was the better policy. The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st yea vote.  Yea: Manchin  Nay: Capito  TAX, SPENDING PROGRAMS: The Senate passed a tax and spending bill (H.R. 5376), sponsored by Rep. John A. Yarmuth, D-Ky. The bill's spending measures include changes to Medicare prescription drug programs and various subsidies for non-fossil fuel sources of energy and energy efficiency programs, while its tax policy changes include a 15 percent alternative minimum tax on large companies and about $80 billion of increased funding for the Internal Revenue Service. A supporter, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said it \"will help fight inflation, invest in domestic energy production and manufacturing, reduce carbon emissions, and lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans.\" An opponent, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called the bill \"a long list of reckless tax increases and spending.\" The vote, on Aug. 7, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st yea vote.  Yea: Manchin  Nay: Capito",

    "body": "states from using real election results to show minority voters weren't hurt by a law. H.R. 4 equates protecting Democrats with protecting racial minorities. It was written for Democrats to get and keep power through federal mandates. Washington, D.C. sees plenty of bad ideas, but rarely ideas this bad. Our founders believed that power was best left closest to the people. It's why they left power over elections to the states. A change to the original constitutional agreement would be disastrous for our union. If enacted, H.R. 4 would put DOJ bureaucrats in charge of nearly every change in our elections. Radicals inside the DOJ Voting Section, where I used to work, will have absolute power over state elections. For instance, this bill would allow the DOJ to reject any state's voter ID law. No need to prove in court that the law would hurt minorities \u2014 quite the opposite. If a state can't prove a law has zero discriminatory effect, the bureaucrats will reject the law. H.R. 4 reverses the time-tested burdens that underpin our legal system. It forces states to beg for federal approval. This is not what the public wants. A recent poll shows that 8 in 10 Americans support voter ID laws. Americans want to trust their elections. H.R. 4 would make our elections less secure. Moreover, the original Voting Rights Act worked. It has never been easier to vote , and this is reflected in high minority voting rates. A federal takeover of elections is not necessary. H.R.4 is about taking power away from the people and giving it to the D.C. swamp. It's about giving D.C. bureaucrats complete and total control of how we run our elections. Federal bureaucrats should stay out of our elections. The Constitution gives states the power to run their own elections, and that's exactly what the people want. J. Christian Adams is the president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a former Justice Department attorney, and current commissioner on the United States Commission for Civil Rights.

    "body": "On Wednesday, the House Oversight and Reform Committee will mark up House Resolution 51, the pending D.C. statehood bill. The bill, which has enough co-sponsors to pass the House and nearly enough for the Senate, given filibuster circumvention, would grant the new state two senators and one representative. These seats would likely be claimed by Democrats, prompting congressional Republicans to question the bill's constitutionality Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right Though the bill is written to address many of these concerns , one largely ignored provision in the bill remains suspect: H.R. 51 would admit D.C. as a state without D.C. first drafting a state constitution by specially elected convention. The Constitution likely requires such a convention, and no state has been admitted without one. Unless members of Congress revise H.R. 51 to require an elected convention, the Supreme Court could plausibly strike down the bill. Statehood advocates should revise the bill to address this critical oversight. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement The Constitution has a few requirements for admitting new states. Under one of these requirements, the guarantee clause , a prospective state must have a \u201crepublican form of government.\u201d Early framers of state constitutions understood \u201crepublican government\u201d to require drafting a state constitution by a specially elected convention . And, in an early, watershed case , the Supreme Court upheld the legitimacy of Rhode Island's disputed state constitution, noting the document was drafted by a specially elected state constitutional convention. Historically, drafting a constitution in convention has been the only path to statehood. In my recent book on state constitution-making, I surveyed all 411 attempts to draft state constitutions since 1776 and found that no state successfully entered the union without first specially selecting a constitutional convention. In this sense, H.R. 51 is unorthodox. The bill imitates the \u201c Tennessee Plan ,\u201d established in 1796 when Tennesseans, in compliance with the Constitution's guarantee clause, elected a state constitutional convention, drafted a state constitution and applied to Congress for statehood. All states to later use this Tennessee Plan held state constitutional conventions when applying for statehood, as did D.C. when applying for statehood in 1982 Advertisement Story continues below advertisement H.R. 51 does not follow this element of the Tennessee Plan. The bill would admit D.C. as a state under a 2016 constitution drafted not by an elected convention but by a panel of lawyers appointed by D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). The document was then approved by a commission including Bowser, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelsohn (D) and D.C.'s \u201cshadow\u201d congressional representatives . This commission then presented the 2016 constitution for public hearings, dubbed a \u201cconvention,\u201d and offered the document for an approval vote. As such, D.C. residents were not given the option to elect convention delegates to draft a constitution. Some residents in hearings condemned this process as undemocratic. This oversight is a liability for H.R. 51. If the bill passed, the Supreme Court could reject the act for admitting D.C. under a constitution that failed the requirements of the guarantee clause. Members of Congress should revise H.R. 51 to require D.C. to elect a state constitutional convention after passage. All states admitted to the union have used this method, and D.C.'s state constitutional drafting commission signaled in hearings that it would be open to such a convention. This simple revision is the safest path for D.C. to get statehood. Read more: Jamal Holtz: D.C. needs statehood more than ever, and the Capitol riot proves it Michael D.

    "body": "All gun control bills share the same basic goal: a world in which fewer people own firearms. Some bills simply ban certain types of firearms or ammunition outright. Others place obstacles in the path of owning firearms or ammunition to make them more difficult and expensive to obtain, thereby shrinking the market for them. The fundamental flaw of these approaches is that they treat all law-abiding firearm owners as would-be criminals, when the reality is that most firearm-related assaults and homicides are committed by people who completely disregard the law, including laws against taking human life.\n H.R. 127\u00a0combines both failed approaches. It bans common types of ammunition and original equipment magazines for most self-defense firearms. And, it makes all firearms more difficult to obtain and possess through a punitive licensing and registration scheme. In its details, however, H.R. 127 is so outrageous, persecutory, and unworkable that its main function is simply to display the hostility of its author and supporters toward firearms, those who own them, and those who want to own them.\n H.R. 127 would ban common types of ammunition, including every shotgun shell larger than .410.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 The bill states: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to possess ammunition that is 0.50 caliber or greater.\u201d\n o\u00a0\u00a0 Violations of this ban would result in the imposition of a fine of\u00a0at least\u00a0$50,000 and imprisonment of\u00a0at least\u00a010 years, mandatory penalties not seen in many violent or infamous federal crimes, including\u00a0torturing someone to death\u00a0outside the U.S. or\u00a0committing treason during wartime.\n   o\u00a0\u00a0 Hunting whitetail deer would be legally impossible in at least 10 U.S. states if these restrictions went into effect.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 The bill would also make it impossible for Americans to follow\u00a0President Biden\u2019s advice\u00a0to keep a double-barreled, 12 gauge shotgun for self-defense, rather than an AR-15.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 Innumerable numbers of shotgun shells currently possessed by law-abiding people for lawful purposes would suddenly become contraband.\n \n H.R. 127 would force Americans to relinquish hundreds of millions firearm magazines with no compensation.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 The bill states: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device\u201d, and defines such devices to include those \u201cthat can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition,\u201d excluding certain integral .22 rimfire magazines.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Industry production figures show that there are hundreds of millions of 11+ round magazines.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 As with its ban on shotgun shells, H.R.127\u2019s magazine ban would apply retroactively, affecting items already owned by millions of Americans for lawful purposes, with no compensation for owners forced to relinquish property that was lawful when obtained.\n H.R. 127 would require the federal government to register\u00a0some 400 million guns\u00a0in the span of only 3 months.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 The bill states that registration information would have to be provided to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive, \u201cin the case of a firearm acquired before the effective date of this section, within 3 months after the effective date of this section.\u201d\n o\u00a0\u00a0 But BATFE would also have to create the registration system during those 3 months.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 Because the U.S. (intentionally) does not already have a national firearms registry, it would be impossible for the government to fairly and effectively enforce this system with respect to existing gun owners.\n The firearm registry database would have to be made available to \u201call members of the public,\u201d as well as \u201call branches of the United States Armed Forces,\u201d among others.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 This would facilitate private discrimination against gun owners, including in such things as employment and access to essential services such as banking, insurance, or housing.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 It also seems to presuppose that the military, which is prohibited by law from engaging in domestic law enforcement, has some role in policing civilian firearm ownership.\n Ironically, criminals who possess firearms illegally would self-exempt themselves from the registration requirement, and under\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court case law, could not be required to disclose their illegal firearm possession through registration.\n \nH.R. 127 would retroactively criminalize firearm ownership by young adults.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, there is no federal prohibition on adults aged 18 or older possessing otherwise lawful firearms.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 The bill, however, would require a license to possess any firearm, and licenses would only be available to those aged 21 or older.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 Millions of young adults, including those in the military, would become ineligible to possess firearms for their own lawful purposes under this legislation, including any firearms they already owned.\n H.R. 127 would discourage voluntary mental health treatment, including for combat veterans or victims of violent trauma, by permanently prohibiting the issuance of a license to anyone who \u201chas been hospitalized \u2026 with a mental illness, disturbance, or diagnosis (including \u2026 addiction to a controlled substance \u2026 or alcohol) \u2026 .\u201d\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 Anyone who had been hospitalized with a \u201cbrain disease\u201d would also be ineligible for a license, including those suffering from brain cancer, epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n H.R. 127 would effectively price lawful firearm ownership out of reach for many of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 It would require the holder of a firearm license to pay a tax (masquerading as government-issued \u201cinsurance\u201d) of $800 per year.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 License applicants (and even other members of their household, as directed) would also have to undergo a psychological evaluation at their own expense.\n H.R. 127 has a long way to go before becoming law.\n \no\u00a0\u00a0 The bill has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing, and it currently has zero cosponsors.\n o\u00a0\u00a0 While it is not presently moving, it does show how far gun control advocates would like to go in attacking the right to keep and bear arms.",

This law received extensive bipartisan support, as it passed the House 335 to 97 and the Senate by voice vote. And it\u2019s expected to be signed into law by President Biden given his administration\u2019s support of this proposed law. Let\u2019s take a look at what this law does and what it means for employees.\n \n \n\n\n \nThe Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021\n \nCompared to many other laws passed by Congress H.R. 4445 is pretty short and straightforward. Basically, it amends the Federal Arbitration Act to make it easier for victims of sexual assault and/or harassment to bring suit in court and not be forced to arbitrate their legal claims. H.R. 4445 provides the following:\n \n \nFirst, prospective plaintiffs, not the defendants, get to choose whether to litigate their sexual assault or harassment claims in court or through arbitration. Individuals are no longer forced to arbitration and have this right to choose even if they previously signed an agreement limiting their legal remedies to arbitration only.\n \n \nSecond, individuals may choose to bring suit individually or as a class (through a class-action lawsuit). This right also exists regardless of whether the individual signed an agreement waiving their right to collective legal action.\n \n \nThird, the applicability of H.R. 4445 to a given case is to be decided under federal law and by a federal judge, not an arbitrator. \n \nFourth, this law would partially apply retroactively. What this means is that any existing forced arbitration clauses or contracts are now voidable, even if the individual signed the forced arbitration agreement before H.R. 4445 officially becomes law. However, prior cases that have already been completed through forced arbitration cannot be reopened and litigated in court.\n \n \nFifth, H.R. 4445 isn\u2019t just limited to the employment context. In addition to employees, other people potentially affected by this law include clients, customers, patients and consumers. This is because many consumer services, like property leases, ridesharing apps, home improvement contracts and so on, often require the consumer to sign a contract forcing them to arbitrate any legal claims concerning sexual harassment or assault (instead of going to court).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n  \n  \n   \n   WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 10: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) pats Sen. Lindsey Graham ...

The bipartisan legislation will prevent perpetrators from being able to push survivors of sexual harassment and sexual assault into the secretive, biased process of forced arbitration (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Times via Getty Images \n  \n \nWhy H.R. 4445 Is So Important\n \nThis new law is more than just giving victims of sexual harassment and assault \u201ctheir day in court.\u201d It\u2019s also about forcing companies to put more effort into addressing sexual assault or harassment claims.\n \nNow that companies know it\u2019s far more likely allegations of sexual misconduct could result in a public lawsuit, they will try harder to prevent it from happening in the first place. It\u2019s true that arbitration isn\u2019t always confidential. However, it\u2019s usually easier for a company-defendant to keep what goes on during arbitration private compared to a conventional civil suit in state or federal court.\n \nSo H.R. 4445 is also about greater transparency. As we\u2019ve seen with the #MeToo movement, sometimes it\u2019s not a legal judgment or court case that will motivate companies to change. Instead, it\u2019s an incident or allegation going viral and/or becoming a major topic of discussion from the water cooler to the dinner table. \n \nWhen things aren\u2019t public, it\u2019s all too easy for companies to make sexual harassment claims go away by offering the accuser a confidential settlement. Sure, this might bring justice to that particular victim. But the confidential nature of the settlement means that the harasser can more easily find a new victim.",

    "body": "has seen 18 bills that have been introduced that directly impact cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, or central bank digital currencies. Last Congress, the main focus was around the introduction of Facebook's new Libra project - renamed Diem - with an intense focus on the potential impact of stablecoins. Back in 2019, the Blockchain Association did an outstanding effort on the Hill with helping to differentiate between Bitcoin and other more centralized cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the birth of a digital dollar or central bank digital currency (CBDC) made a splash in the crypto community, while Coin Center, the leading think tank in Washington D.C. on policy matters related to cryptocurrency, presented the dangers of losing privacy in moving forward with a U.S. digital dollar. Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, speaks as Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican ... [+] from Wyoming, right, listens during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Monday, Aug. 9, 2021. The Senate moved closer to passing a $550 billion infrastructure package after a drawn-out debate pushed action into this week and left the status of several proposed changes unsettled. Photographer: Ting Shen/Bloomberg This article seeks to lay out for those newly interested in crypto regulation what some of the legislation is about that has been introduced. The sections will be divided into bills that cover bills that aim at providing regulatory clarity for crypto, the technology underlying bitcoin called blockchain, and consideration of a U.S. CBDC. U.S. Policy On Crypto And Providing Regulatory Clarity Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) has introduced three bills already, including the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that would provide a safe harbor from licensing and registration for certain non-controlling blockchain developers and providers of blockchain services. The idea would be to prevent blockchain platforms with no direct control over tokens from needing to register as money transmitters. His most well-known bill is probably the Securities Clarity Act (H.R. 4451). The Securities Clarity Act states that an investment contract asset (for example, a digital token) is separate and distinct from the securities offering that it may have been a part of. The approach is technology-neutral, and applies equally to all assets offered and sold, whether tangible or digital. This new defined term would refer to any asset sold as part of an investment contract that would not be considered a \u201csecurity\u201d but for its sale as part of an investment contract. Both the Securities Clarity Act and the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act received the endorsement of Coin Center, Blockchain Association, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Emmer also introduced the Safe Harbor For Taxpayers With Forked Assets Act of 2021 (H.R. 3273) that holds harmless taxpayers attempting to report gains or losses of their forked digital assets and delineates that receipt of a forked virtual currency may not constitute a taxable event. This legislation is designed to provide a safe harbor until the IRS provides clear and consistent rules for forked cryptocurrencies. Similar to the Securities Clarity Act is another bill introduced by Congressman Warren Davidson (R-NC). Davidson introduced the Token Taxonomy Act (H.R. 1628) that specifically excludes digital tokens from being securities for regulatory purposes. This bill also focused on three tax-related policies, including the exclusion from gross income any gains from virtual currency transactions up to $600. The other concepts included tax-free treatment of some virtual currency exchange transactions under Section 1031 that is typically associated with real property and offer benefits to holding virtual currencies in IRA accounts. The other bill that intersected with the tax treatment of virtual currencies was of course the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684) that sought to amend Section 6045(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require, \u201cany person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.'' Although an Amendment to change this language to specifically exclude bitcoin miners and software providers from the tax reporting requirement was agreed upon, it was ultimately not accepted in the Senate and now waits for deliberation by the House of Representatives before being sent to President Biden's desk for signature. Meanwhile, Representative Don Beyer (D-VA) surprised many of the regular Members of Congress heavily involved in developing legislation for crypto by introducing a comprehensive bill called the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act (H.R. 4741). The bill would create statutory definitions for digital assets and digital asset securities and provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with authority over digital asset securities and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with authority over digital assets. Additionally, the bill would provide legal certainty as to the regulatory status for the top 90% of the digital asset market (by market capitalization and trading volume) through a joint SEC/CFTC rulemaking, and require digital asset transactions that are not recorded on the publicly distributed ledger to be reported to a registered Digital Asset Trade Repository within 24 hours to minimize the potential for fraud and promote transparency. Additionally, the bill would explicitly add digital assets and digital asset securities to the statutory definition of \u201cmonetary instruments,\u201d under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), formalizing the regulatory requirements for digital assets and digital asset securities to comply with anti-money laundering, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. Finally, the bill would provide the Federal Reserve with explicit authority to issue a digital version of the U.S. Dollar, clarify that digital assets, digital asset securities and fiat based stablecoins are not U.S. legal tender, and provide the U.S. Treasury Secretary with authority to permit or prohibit US Dollar and other fiat-based stablecoins, as well as direct the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to issue consumer advisories on \u201cnon coverage\u201d of digital assets or digital asset securities to ensure that consumers are aware that they are not insured or protected in the same way as bank deposits or securities.Finally, the bill would require legislative recommendations from FinCEN, SEC and CFTC to provide clarity on dividing lines between who must register as a money services business versus who must register as a securities or commodities exchange. For all the work that has gone into some of the bills previously discussed, the Eliminate Barriers To Innovation Act of 2021 (H.R. 1602) has made the most progress, having already passed the House of Representatives and now awaits the Senate. The bill was introduced by the House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Patrick McHenry (R-NC) with Chairman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) of the Financial Technology Task Force and would form a joint CFTC And SEC working group on digital assets to help provide clarity in what is a security and what is a commodity among digital assets. The working group would be composed of public and private representatives to study and issue a report to Congress. A companion bill from the Token Taxonomy Act was introduced by Congressman Darren Soto (D-FL) in the form of the Digital Taxonomy Act (H.R. 3638). This bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to report on its efforts to address unfair or deceptive trade practices related to digital tokens. Soto has been consistently active in looking for ways to support the industry and assist with the growth of blockchain technology. Blockchain Technology For Consumer Protection Soto introduced both the Blockchain Innovation Act (H.R. 3639), and the Blockchain Technology Coordination Act of 2021 (H.R. 3534). The Blockchain Innovation Act would require the Department of Commerce to consult with the Federal Trade Commission and other relevant agencies to study potential applications of blockchain technology, while the Blockchain Technology Coordination Act would establish a \u2018National Blockchain Technology Coordination Office' within the Department of Commerce. The Consumer Safety and Technology Act (H.R. 3723), introduced by Congressman Jerry McNerney (D-CA), and co-sponsored by Soto, would require the Department of Commerce to consult with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on potential applications of blockchain technology and also require the FTC to report on efforts to address unfair or deceptive trade practices with digital currencies. Meanwhile, Congressman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) and Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D-CA), along with Senator Todd Young (R-IN) and Senator Ed Merkley (D-MA), introduced the Blockchain Promotion Act of 2021 (H.R. 3612, S.1869). This bill would direct the Department of Commerce to establish the Blockchain Working Group to submit a report to Congress that contains a recommended definition of the distributed ledger technology commonly referred to as blockchain technology. Congressman Ted Budd (R-NC) introduced the Financial Technology Protection Act (H.R. 296) that would provides for the investigation of new financial technologies (e.g., digital currencies) and their use in terrorism and other illicit activities. Specifically, the bill would establish a Independent Financial Technology Task Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit Financing, which must research terrorist and illicit use of new financial technologies and issue an annual report. Additionally, The Department of the Treasury would be required to establish a fund to provide a reward for a person who provides information leading to the conviction of an individual involved with terrorist use of digital currencies as well as the creation of a FinTech Leadership in Innovation and Financial Intelligence Program to support the development of tools and programs to detect terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies. Finally, Representative Bobby Rush (D-IL) introduced the RESCUE Act for Black and Community Banks (H.R. 154) that requires the Comptroller General of the United States to carry out a study on blockchain technology and determine. whether such technology could be used to increase investment by lower-income individuals in startups and other crowd-funded companies. Central Bank Digital Currency: A U.S. \u2018Digital Dollar' No less than ten Senators support a bill designed to examine the national security implications of the People's Republic of China's efforts to create an official digital currency (S. 2543). Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the bill that would require the President to report within one year on the (1) risks arising from potential surveillance of transactions; (2) risks related to security and illicit finance; and (3) risks related to economic coercion and social control by the People's Republic of China. Particularly after 5G, the threat of China's design of a new digital currency has quickly gotten the attention of lawmakers this year. Meanwhile both Representative Bill Foster (D-IL) and Representative French Hill (R-AR) introduced the Central Bank Digital Currency Study Act of 2021 (H.R. 2211) that would set out a comprehensive study on the impact of the introduction of a U.S. CBDC. Both Foster and Hill led the way originally in writing a letter to the Federal Reserve asking the agency to start considering the possibility of a CBDC. The study in this bill would cover areas such as BSA/AML concerns, cross-border remittances, financial inclusion efforts, and data privacy and security issues, to name a few. Hill also introduced another bipartisan bill with Representative Jim Himes (D-CT) called the 21st Century Dollar Act (H.R. 3506), that focuses not just on a CBDC, but more broadly on the question of how to keep the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. The bill would require the development of a report on a \u2018Dollar Strategy' for the United States. Finally, Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) introduced the Automatic Boost To Communities Act (H.R. 1030) that seeks to create monthly stimulus payments during the Covid-19 crisis. As a method of delivery, the bill authorizes digital dollars, or dollar balances consisting of digital ledger entries recorded as liabilities in the accounts of any Federal reserve bank and digital coins or currency instruments issued by the United States Treasury as legal tender. These digital dollars would be held as bearer instruments in any digital dollar cash wallet approved by the United States Treasury. A person could also have a digital dollar account wallet maintained by the Federal Reserve as well. With still over a year to go in watching how the 117th Congress may still act on cryptocurrency and blockchain policy, the bills this article helped explain provides a good primer on the main issues Congress is sorting through as it relates to cryptocurrency, blockchain, and CBDC.

These legislative efforts would support key resources for youth, including increasing access to mental health professionals in schools, training programs on suicide prevention awareness, increased funding for research into mental health disparities in youth of color, and increased support for efforts to diversify the behavioral health workforce.Emergency room suicide prevention efforts would also be addressed by broadening access to screening, implementing updated protocols, leveraging new technology, and providing follow-up care to connect patients with resources upon discharge. We are also supportive of efforts to intensify data surveillance, expanding real-time data collection of suicide and self-harm that will better inform prevention. First responder suicide prevention efforts were also included to ensure that the mental health needs of first responders are being addressed and new best practices are developed.Additional legislative efforts included improvements to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by strengthening standards and publicizing the change to 9-8-8 as the suicide prevention and mental health crisis line in July 2022.We applaud the sponsoring legislators and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, especially Chairman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) for their leadership in passing these vital pieces of mental health and suicide prevention legislation. I urge the Senate to prioritize passage of these bills, so that increased access to mental health and substance use care and suicide prevention resources are more readily available to support patients, families, and providers.I am grateful for our over 32,000 volunteer Field Advocates for making their voices heard, and for continuing to contact their Members of Congress. They show us that when we advocate together, that suicide prevention and mental health are a top priority.\"is dedicated to saving lives and bringing hope to those affected by suicide. AFSP creates a culture that's smart about mental health through education and community programs, develops suicide prevention through research and advocacy, and provides support for those affected by suicide.

    "body": "WINTER HAVEN, Florida \u2014 Florida will take decisive action and \u201cimmediately sue\u201d in the event of the radical left\u2019s House-passed H.R.1, or the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d becoming law, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) told Breitbart News on Monday.\n\nIn a conversation on the role of \u201cwoke\u201d corporations, some of which have targeted Georgia over its recent election integrity law, DeSantis noted these politically active entities are not speaking out against radical objectives the left is pursuing, such as packing the Supreme Court or pursuing H.R. 1. which would essentially nationalize U.S. elections and strip states of their ability to implement basic election integrity measures, such as voter identification.\n\n\u201cAnd I know are they out there protesting H.R. 1 in the Congress which is outrageous and unconstitutional? No. I don\u2019t hear that,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nWhen pressed further on what the state would do in the event of the \u201cFor the People Act\u201d becoming law, DeSantis vowed his administration would take prompt action.\n\n\u201cWe would immediately sue that it\u2019s unconstitutional and I think we would win on that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at a minimum, even the most positive view of H.R. 1\u2019s constitutionality would acknowledge you can\u2019t apply it to a presidential election because the Constitution says electors are chosen by the state legislatures, and you can\u2019t apply it to state elections, because the elections provision that they\u2019re citing in the federal \u2014 that only applies to federal legislative elections.\u201d\n\nNotably, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody (R) is one of over a dozen state attorneys general who signed a letter deeming H.R. 1 \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and vowing to \u201cseek legal remedies to protect the Constitution, the sovereignty of all states, our elections, and the rights of our citizens\u201d if the measure becomes law.\n\nDemocrats, he explained, are \u201ceffectively trying to commandeer\u201d Florida to run congressional elections \u201cin a way that we don\u2019t want to run them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think it would be a real serious standoff. But we will not run a presidential election like that, and we will not run the state elections like that regardless of what ends up happening in the courts,\u201d DeSantis promised, predicting it would be struck down and warning Democrat attempts to abolish the filibuster, if successful, will backfire.\n\n\u201cBut I do think it would be struck down, and I do think D.C. statehood would be struck down too as being unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they abolish the filibuster, to push through a couple of these radical things, and those radical things end up getting nixed in the courts, then they\u2019re going to end up giving a Republican majority no filibuster, so it will backfire on them big time if they end up going down that road.\u201d",

    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said that measures to contain prescription drug pricing would be included in the infrastructure legislation. Specifically, Pelosi stated that \u201cone of the considerations that members are discussing is whether we have aspects of H.R. 3, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now legislation\u201d incorporated in the forthcoming infrastructure bill.Should the infrastructure bill be enacted, with \u201caspects of H.R. 3\u201d that include measures which peg U.S. prices of a number of prescription drugs to an international price index, it may have negative ramifications for the biopharmaceutical industry.Prominent legislators, including Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), are aggressively pursuing ways to tackle drug pricing. On March 23 rd, in a Senate subcommittee hearing on prescription drug prices, lawmakers discussed authorizing Medicare to negotiate prices of certain brand-name drugs and to base these prices on assessments of the drugs\u2019 clinical benefits.The U.S. has never had a publicly funded, independent health technology assessment organization evaluate prescription drugs, diagnostics, and devices, and subsequently provide recommendations on pricing and reimbursement. To have Medicare negotiate drug pricing based on evidence produced by a health technology assessment entity would constitute a major change.But, the direct price control measures in H.R. 3 go further, and are of more immediate consequence to the biopharmaceutical industry.The H.R. 3 bill, which passed the House in December of 2019 but has not been taken up by the Senate since, would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare. However, this negotiation process would cap the prices of a select number of drugs in both Medicare Part B and D, based on an international price index. Namely, the bill would require a drug\u2019s price to be set at or below 120% of the average price across six high-income countries: Australia, Canada, U.K., France, Germany, and Japan.The pharmaceuticals chosen for index-pricing would be selected on the basis of their high cost and lack of competition. The subset would include at least 50 and up to 125 drugs, plus all single-source insulin products. And, the indexed prices would apply not only to Medicare but could extend to Medicaid and the private sector as well.According to a report published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the legislation would save the government $450 billion. Medicare and other beneficiaries stand to gain financially through lower out-of-pocket spending, as their co-insurance is calculated on the basis of list prices.However, while monetary gains accrue to stakeholders like the government, others will lose out, most notably the biopharmaceutical industry, through lost revenue. Moreover, lower out-of-pocket costs notwithstanding, Medicare beneficiaries and others could be faced with reduced access to newer treatments, particularly in the long term. This is because price controls of the kind envisioned may lead to diminished R&D in future drug development.How much of an impact the H.R. 3 proposed measures would have on innovation - for brevity, defined as numbers of newly approved drugs - is subject to debate. Biopharmaceutical industry groups maintain that H.R. 3 could have potentially devastating consequences, as it would reduce earnings by more than 60% on average for the companies most impacted. In turn, this could reach back to negatively impact investments in companies\u2019 R&D programs, leading to more than 60 fewer medicines over a 10-year period. A CBO report\u2019s estimates were much less dire, as it predicts that H.R. 3 would lead to between eight and 15 fewer drugs launched during the next decade.Given that H.R. 3 targets high-cost drugs this would disproportionately impact new treatments in the rare diseases and oncology spaces; areas of high unmet need. Conspicuously, H.R. 3 aims at high-cost drugs but does not distinguish between the value of different drugs. Some high-cost drugs may be of considerable value, that is, cost-effective, particularly in spaces with limited or no availability of treatment alternatives.Unlike the discussion in the March 23rd Senate subcommittee hearing, which referenced the role of health technology assessment to inform Medicare negotiations, H.R. 3 narrowly focuses on cost without regard for value.It\u2019s unclear exactly how the biopharmaceutical industry would respond to the implementation of H.R. 3 steps. But, speculatively several scenarios could play out.Launch prices for new drugs introduced into the U.S. would likely be higher, especially those granted regulatory approval first in the U.S. before other markets. The higher initial prices may be a reaction to what could happen to the prices of companies\u2019 existing portfolio of drugs. This is because H.R. 3 also includes the imposition of new rebates for existing drugs whose prices increase faster than inflation.Furthermore, H.R. 3 may have repercussions regarding whether, where, and at what prices drug companies will launch new products in the six reference countries to avoid having low prices available for inclusion in the international pricing index. Companies may decide to delay or not enter markets where lower prices would adversely affect their U.S. revenues.An unintended consequence of H.R. 3 could be a reduction in the pool of investment capital for risky projects with the potential for large rewards, for example in the oncology and orphan disease spaces.It\u2019s difficult to predict the precise series of responses by the biopharmaceutical industry to drug price containment actions subsumed under the pending infrastructure bill. But one thing is clear, the industry must gird itself for possible impediments to its ability to price products as it sees fit.",

Within those standards, states will still have the ability to administer elections, the way they always have.\n\nThe same fear-stoking arguments about the national government telling states how to run their elections were made during the Jim Crow era when black Americans were blocked from the ballot box through terror and violence. With passage of the Voting Rights Act, we worked to move away from that.\n\nWhat we are seeing now is an attempt to go back to an era in which there are discriminatory laws on the books to stop certain groups from voting and consolidate power for the minority. I am a voting-rights attorney and member of Congress representing Dallas, Texas. The restrictions taking place in my home state and others are egregious and have put our democracy at a tipping point.

It\u2019s time for Congress to Act. We need stronger gun laws,\u201d\u00a0Julianne Moore told her 1.9 million Instagram followers.\n\nThe Atlanta shooting suspect bought his gun at retail, which means a background check for the gun sale was part of the process.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, NBC News reported that the shooter\u2019s gun was \u201cpurchased legally.\u201d This means H.R. 8\u2019s expansion of background checks, implementing them so they occur at private points-of sale versus only at retail points-of-sale, would have done nothing to hinder, much less stop the Atlanta attack.\n\nH.R. 1446 impacts background check extensions, which come at the behest of FBI reviewers conducting the checks. NBC News noted that the shooter bought his gun the same day he used it criminally. Therefore, it appears no background check extension was in play, which means H.R. 1446 was irrelevant re: the Atlanta shootings.\n\nAnother Hollywood gun control activist, actor Bill Eichner, also reacted to the Atlanta shootings by pushing background checks.\n\nAgain, the Atlanta shooter bought his gun at retail and a background check is part of that purchase process.\n\nHours before calling for background checks, Eichner tweeted in support of an \u201cAssault Weapons\u201d Ban, writing, \u201cDestroy the filibuster and get this shit done!\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta shooter did not use an \u201cassault weapon\u201d in his attacks.

    "body": "At a virtual town hall meeting in August, generations of Japanese American community organizers spoke alongside leaders from the Black reparations movement.\n\nCalled \u201cReparations Then, Reparations Now!\u201d the meeting coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians hearings, which marked a turning point in the Japanese American redress movement.\n\n\u201cJust as Black Americans supported our community\u2019s struggle for redress, we will strive to support and show solidarity with Black people as they fight for reparations today,\u201d said Michael Nishimura, a 29-year-old doctoral student and organizer.\n\nThe event was hosted by the Japanese American social justice organizations Nikkei Progressives and Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress, which are part of a growing coalition of organizations pushing for the passage of H.R. 40, the federal bill to create a commission to study reparations for Black Americans.\n\nOriginally introduced by Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan in 1989, H.R. 40 has recently gained momentum amid the country\u2019s reckoning over race and justice. The House Judiciary Committee advanced it in April, and the bill awaits a vote in the House.\n\nOver the past year, Japanese Americans have been key proponents of H.R. 40, organizing letter-writing campaigns, webinars, phone-banking sessions and town hall meetings that have been \u201cessential\u201d to the effort, according to Kenniss Henry, co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America's national legislative commission.\n\nIn addition to contributing people power, Japanese American organizers are sharing something perhaps more valuable: their first-hand knowledge of the redress process.\n\nJapanese Americans are one of the first and only groups to receive redress from the U.S. government.\n\nDuring World War II, people of Japanese descent were considered a domestic threat to the United States. After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii, an estimated 120,000 people of Japanese descent \u2014 including American citizens \u2014 were sent to concentration camps, euphemistically called \u201crelocation centers.\u201d\n\nJohn Tateishi, 82, was sent to Manzanar, one of the United States\u2019 10 concentration camps, when he was just 3 and later became national director of the redress campaign for the oldest Asian American civil rights group, the Japanese American Citizens League. He traced the origins of the community\u2019s reparations movement to the 1960s, when third-generation Japanese Americans, called sansei, had graduated from college and started challenging the older generation\u2019s silence about World War II, which he said was the result of complex cultural factors and trauma.\n\n\u201cIn that process began the reparations demand, that they wanted some justice for what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nOrganizing on the ground in their own communities also helped fuel the redress movement. Veteran organizer Kathy Masaoka, 73, said the grassroots struggles against planned redevelopment, gentrification and evictions in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo in the 1970s, for instance, birthed organizations that would go on to play key roles in the reparations fight.\n\nGroups such as the JACL and Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress started formally lobbying the government over the reparations, and by 1980, the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was formed to study the subject. In 1981, it held historic hearings in cities across the country.\n\nCivil rights organizations including the American Jewish Committee, an early supporter, the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League also played crucial roles in lobbying for the bill.\n\nIn 1988, the Civil Liberties Act was signed by President Ronald Reagan. The act included a formal apology for the \u201cgrave injustice\u201d of internment, $20,000 checks to more than 80,000 survivors and a fund for public education on the subject of internment.\n\nTateishi received his reparations check by mail in 1990.\n\nWithin a year of the bill\u2019s passage, Tateishi started receiving requests to speak at meetings about Black reparations.\n\n\u201cI presented a caveat that what I was going to talk about may not have any application or interest in their strategies,\u201d said Tateishi, author of the 2020 memoir \u201cRedress: The Inside Story of the Successful Campaign for Japanese American Reparations.\u201d \u201cWe faced a very different kind of situation than African Americans do and did with the American public.\u201d\n\nSolidarity between Japanese Americans and Black Americans around federal reparations is decades old. The civil rights movement \u201cwas deeply embedded in our early formation and early thinking,\u201d Masaoka said of the Japanese American redress movement. Representatives of the JACL attended the March on Washington in 1963.\n\nOpposition to the Vietnam War and the push for ethnic studies classes in California colleges were other uniting forces for African American, Asian American, Native American and Chicano students.\n\nBlack politicians \u2014 including the late Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif.; the late Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif.; and the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 were also integral to the redress movement, said traci kato-kiriyama, an artist and organizer with the group Nikkei Progressives. In his historic testimony on the House floor in 1987, Dellums recalled watching his childhood friend, who was Japanese American, being taken away from his home.\n\n\u201cThis Black American cries out as loudly as my Asian American brothers and sisters on this issue,\u201d Dellums said, urging Congress not to strip key provisions from the Civil Liberties Act.\n\nIn fall 2020, the Japanese American organizations Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress and Nikkei Progressives formed a joint committee to study reparations for Black people in the U.S.\n\nBoth groups had previously signed a letter entitled \u201cWhy We Can\u2019t Wait,\u201d along with 300 other civil rights, faith-based and social justice groups, urging legislators to pass H.R. 40.\n\nOne of their first actions as a coalition was drafting an open letter signed by 46 formerly incarcerated Japanese Americans, including former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and \"Star Trek\" actor George Takei, to again urge House leadership to support H.R. 40.\n\nAnother partnership has formed between kato-kiriyama of Nikkei Progressives and Dreisen Heath, who leads the U.S. reparations work for Human Rights Watch. Since February, they have been meeting every Wednesday over Zoom as part of what they call the \u201creparations legislative working group.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s designed to communicate the reparations strategy that\u2019s being discussed among lawmakers, congressional staff and national advocacy organizations with organizers on the ground.\n\nUsually, about 45 organizers attend the meeting, Heath said, including representatives from the JACL, American Civil Liberties Union, Color of Change, Movement for Black Lives and a number of faith organizations, including the National Council of Churches, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice.\n\nH.R. 40, as well as its Senate companion, S. 40, is both a concrete political goal and what Heath called a \u201ccentral organizing tool.\u201d The coalition comprises over 450 different organizations that are committed to a national reparations movement.\n\n\u201cThe local constituencies and grassroots organizing groups are extremely key to how we move this work forward,\u201d Heath said.\n\nWhen Masaoka testified in February during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on H.R. 40, she told lawmakers that Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress and Nikkei Progressives support H.R. 40 because \u201cone, it is the right thing to do; two, it is long overdue; and three, because we know it is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought that was a pretty powerful statement to make,\u201d said Masaoka, whose testimony was prepared with help from organizers at the JACL, the ACLU and the Japanese American social justice organization Tsuru for Solidarity. \u201cIt is what we as a community can really offer to the struggle and to the campaign.\u201d\n\nIn the days leading up to the hearing, the community had been mobilizing. Tsuru for Solidarity organized a letter-writing drive and sent 300 letters, mostly from formerly incarcerated Japanese Americans and family members, to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a form letter,\u201d organizer Lisa Doi, 30, said. \u201cIt was [an opportunity to] sit down, take out a blank piece of paper and write down why you support H.R. 40. It was really moving.\u201d\n\nIn these letters, Doi said, community members reflected on how their own history of racial violence during internment was \u201ca starting point for solidarity\u201d with Black Americans that are facing what is admittedly a \u201cmuch longer history of racial violence.\u201d\n\nSome of the letters also talked about the impact of receiving redress and how the movement, legislation and reparations initiative \u201cstarted a healing process\u201d within the Japanese American community.\n\nIn March, the coalition co-sponsored a virtual education session with the ACLU, the National African American Reparations Commission and the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, or N'COBRA, dedicated to discussing the overlap between the two movements. Recent months have also included an H.R. 40 town hall, a week of action and a 12-hour day of action that included three live email and phone-banking sessions.\n\nFor Heath, the work is constant.\n\n\u201cWhen I close my computer, my mind doesn\u2019t stop thinking about reparations,\u201d she said.\n\nShe has testified in front of Congress twice regarding reparations, and she authored the 2020 report \u201cThe Case for Reparations in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nHeath has been the central link connecting Japanese American community organizations to the legacy Black reparations advocacy organizations, according to Kenniss Henry, the N\u2019COBRA national legislative commission co-chair.\n\n\u201cWe were intimately aware of the Japanese American groups and all the work that they had done,\u201d Henry said, but it was Heath who brought them formally into the fold.\n\nIn April, the House Judiciary Committee voted to send the bill to the House floor, where it awaits scheduling for a floor vote. Despite the grassroots momentum, the bill faces steep odds.\n\nOrganizers said it\u2019ll be hard to push it through during an election year, and some Democrats have yet to sign on to co-sponsor the bill. And, they said, President Joe\u00a0Biden has not signaled that he considers reparations a legislative priority.\n\nBut organizers are still optimistic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closer than we\u2019ve ever been before,\u201d Heath said.",

    "body": "\u201cI have proposed an alternative drug pricing reform model that will keep Democrats' promise to lower out-of-pocket costs for medicines, in part by empowering the secretary of health and human services to negotiate prices,\u201d Peters said on Tuesday. Peters and fellow Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader from Oregon, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, drafted a narrower alternative to the more sweeping measure favored by the liberal wing of the party, known as H.R. 3, that would allow the government to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. GOP lawmakers have long opposed direct negotiation of drug prices, saying that doing so would stifle innovation of future cures and treatments. The rival legislation from Peters and Schrader would \u201cpreserve innovation\u201d by giving the government narrower negotiating power for drugs that have no other competitors on the market. Peters also has support from Democratic Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York, Lou Correa of California, and Stephanie Murphy of Florida. While H.R. 3 would cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors under Medicare at $2,000, Peters's legislation would adjust the cap on out-of-pocket costs with income, ranging from $1,200 to $3,100, so that the poorest seniors enrolled in the government healthcare program would get the greatest amount of assistance. Peters said in a statement Tuesday that he looked forward to working with his Democratic colleagues to \u201cachieve reforms that help patients, support future innovation and grow American jobs.\u201d House Democrats first passed H.R. 3, or the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, in December 2019, but it stalled before getting a vote in the then-majority-GOP Senate. The Congressional Budget Office, a federal agency that provides economic advice to Congress, estimated that the price negotiation provision in H.R. 3 could save the federal government more than $456 billion over a decade. The CBO has not yet issued an updated score for the Peters bill or for other healthcare proposals being pushed by Democrats in this Congress, such as expanded benefits under Medicare to include hearing, dental, and vision coverage. The Energy and Commerce Committee reconvened Tuesday morning to debate the Democrats' drug price negotiation proposal, which the party plans to include in the $3.5 trillion social infrastructure package known as the Build Back Better Act in the House.

    "body": "Pelosi, D-Calif., discusses ongoing security threats to members of Congress after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot during a news conference on Jan. 28, 2021.\n\n\n\n\nCongressional Democrats have a plan to forever keep Republicans from winning elections and influencing policy decisions with H.R. 1 in the House, and the similar S. 1 in the Senate.\nThey want to empower the government to police more speech, force states to allow vote-by-mail and taxpayer funding of candidates, and silence Americans through fear by exposing their support for issue groups.\nThe fact that these bills are the first filed shows how high a priority they are, even though the nation is still in the middle of a pandemic and economic catastrophe. Under President Barack Obama, H.R. 1 was the stimulus, under President George W. Bush, it was \"No Child Left Behind.\" It\u2019s also a sign that President Biden\u2019s agenda is being dictated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and The Squad.\nLIZ PEEK: BIDEN'S FIRST 10 DAYS\u00a0\u2013 HERE'S HOW HE INFURIATED HALF THE NATION IN RECORD TIME\nThe mess of bad and unconstitutional policies in H.R. 1 are an existential threat to the Republican Party. They would shatter the ability of Americans to effectively organize, support causes they believe in, and hold government accountable.\nH.R. 1 would undermine state election oversight, like efforts to clean up old voter rolls. It eliminates any restrictions on vote-by-mail. Taxpayers would be on the hook for matching\u00a0600%\u00a0of campaign contributions to subsidize candidates they may disagree with \u2013 a practice that has\u00a0been ripe for corruption.\u00a0\nIt empowers federal regulators to categorize and regulate speech, including online.\nNew standards for \"coordination\" would be broad and confusing. All speech that simply mentions a candidate could be illegal four months out from an election\u00a0if groups speak to the public. Worse, at any time, any funded communication that mentions an issue that might be associated with a politician could be illegal.\u00a0\nThe government just has to say the speech \"promotes,\" \"attacks,\" \"supports\" or \"opposes\" a potential candidate.\nWho would be doing the regulating? A newly-partisan Federal Election Commission, since the president would appoint the chairman, who would have new powers, and be a tie-breaking vote on a five-person board (down from a bipartisan six-person board).\u00a0\nOn top of that, H.R. 1 would also force groups to disclose the personal information of supporters in multiple ways, including tacking the names of top supporters on advertisements.\nDemocrats can dress this up with talk of \"dark money\" and pretend they\u2019re worried about money in politics, but they\u2019re only worried about Americans with right-of-center views speaking out.\nA Cato Institute poll released last summer found 62% of respondents don\u2019t believe\u00a0they can express opinions publicly.\nNo billionaires will be harmed in the making of this legislation. The point is to silence dissent and shut down debate through fear, intimidation\u00a0and overregulation.\nAmericans already feel they cannot engage in healthy debate. A Cato Institute poll released last summer found 62% of respondents don\u2019t believe\u00a0they can express opinions publicly.\nIt\u2019s obvious why. There is a growing list of people who have been harassed, doxed, or worse, over their views \u2013 from well-known politicians being yelled at on planes, to\u00a0truck drivers\u00a0getting fired for contrived social media controversies.\u00a0\nWe want moms starting groups to advocate for homeschooling, we want church-goers effectively petitioning government to reopen, we want taxpayers advocating for more reasonable tax rates. They won\u2019t if they fear for their personal safety and security.\nIt is a disgrace that the rights of Americans to associate with and support organizations are\u00a0under threat more than 60\u00a0years after the Supreme Court rebuked Alabama\u2019s attempt to get the private information of NAACP supporters.\u00a0\nIt is clear that privacy is core to our freedoms of speech and association.\nThere is still bipartisan opposition. The ACLU slammed H.R. 1 in 2019\u00a0saying, \"They will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day.\"\nDemocrat leadership doesn\u2019t care. H.R. 1 is their top priority and defeating it should be Republicans' top priority.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nFortunately, the American people understand what is at stake, and they believe in their right to privacy and security: 70% of voters support private giving\u00a0and 70% don\u2019t think anyone has a right to know what groups they contribute to, according to a People United for Privacy survey.\u00a0\nMany Republicans have not been as strong in defense of speech as they should. Now is the time for all right-of-center elected officials, organizations\u00a0and voters to unite on this issue.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "body": "Newt Gingrich tells 'The Ingraham Angle' that Democrats today voted for the most radical position on abortion anywhere on the planet.\n\n\n\n\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  \n\nThe Contract with America became famous because it was the centerpiece of the House Republican campaign, which won a majority for the first time in 40 years.\u00a0\nAs I mentioned in part two of this series, the Contract campaign stood on President Ronald Reagan\u2019s shoulders.\nThe Contract\u2019s Capitol Steps rally of candidates was modeled after the one with Reagan in September 1980. We knew it would draw media attention \u2013 because we had already done it.\nREPUBLICANS, REAGAN STILL HAS LESSONS TO TEACH US IF WE WANT TO BUILD AN AMERICAN MAJORITY\nIn fact, Reagan himself had described a contract at that 1980 event saying, \"This occasion marks the first time that legislative and executive candidates of a party have come together to propose a contract with the American people. But the times demand a unique response: For too long, government has been distant and uncaring, now we must return government to the people.\"\nThe Contract was written with an understanding that nothing that was supported by fewer than 60 percent of the American people could be included. Ideally, we were aiming to only include issues with 70 percent support or more. By definition, that meant we were writing a bipartisan document that appealed far beyond the Republican base.\nFinally, most of the specifics in the Contract grew straight out of President Reagan\u2019s policies. For example, candidate Reagan had advocated a work-oriented welfare reform in his first race for governor in 1966. We finally passed it into law in 1996 (and it became the most successful conservative reform of our lifetime).\n \n      FILE \u2013 Pres. Ronald Reagan walking and giving thumbs up gesture on the South Lawn after returning from Massachusetts.\n      (Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images)\n\n\nWe added one other rule to our development of the Contract. We knew that the news media was our active opponent (many of its members had worked as Democratic staffers previously). So, we insisted that some of our favorite conservative issues (specifically, right to life and school prayer) would not be included in the Contract.\u00a0\nIf we had included them, The New York Times and others would focus solely only on those issues and the rest of our agenda would be buried. This was a tough decision, because I am strongly pro-life and believe America would be much better off with prayer back in school. However, looking back, it was the right move because the media would have totally ignored all the strong points of the Contract and distorted it as a narrow, southern, right-wing document.\nThe biggest misunderstanding about the Contract was its bipartisan nature. The news media had to find an explanation for our stunning victory after four decades in the minority, and left-wing pundits could not blame the arrogance, corruption and failures of their friends in the Democratic Party. Therefore, they had to blame me \u2013 and interpret our victory as narrowly partisan.\nHowever, note how the Contract was framed in a speech on the House floor on Sept. 22, 1994, a week before the Capitol Steps signing ceremony:\n\"There is not a negative word here about the Democratic Party. There is not a negative word here about President Clinton and his administration. It is an effort on our part to be positive.\n\"You might say, why are we being positive about this? I think that there are two very profound reasons why it would be good to have a positive campaign in October 1994, rather than a negative campaign.\n \n      FILE \u2013 UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 09, 1998: Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., makes his first visit to the Capitol after announcing that he will be stepping down from his position as speaker. \u00a0(Photo by Douglas Graham/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images)\n      \n\n\n\"The first reason is that people are so frustrated, people are so hostile, people are so angry, that you do not need to go out and get them madder. You don\u2019t have to go out and beat up on President Clinton or beat up on the Congress. People get it. They are already fed up.\n\"What people want to know, I think, is what are you going to do differently? Our challenge to the Democrats is if they do not like our 10 bills, what are theirs? If they do not like our three reforms, what are theirs? Let us have a debate between ideas, but let us not have the kind of negative smear tactics that have driven the country, I think, to distraction, and have broken down any willingness to have a decent political debate.\nOur bipartisan, American majority approach enabled House Republicans to survive the 1996 loss of the presidential campaign \u2013 and retain the majority for the first time since 1928. The American people endorsed the positive attitude, positive reforms, and focus on an American rather than a Republican agenda.\n \"We are prepared to debate on the issues: Is it a good idea to have a balanced budget amendment, a line-item veto, or not? Is it a good idea to have an effective, believable, and timely death penalty for violent offenders, or not? Should we encourage work and family in the welfare system, or not?\n\"These are real policy proposals. We are going to have next Tuesday a whole set of bills.\u00a0\n\"All 10 bills are already going to be written and available.\n\"There is a second reason, I would argue, why it would be good to actually try to have a debate in October on the issues. I think this country is in trouble. People have talked about the economic recovery and all this stuff. Nonsense. The underlying core pattern of where America is at is real trouble.\n\"If you do not believe me, watch any major city local television news, including Washington, for two nights. The child abuse, the rape, the murders, the cocaine dealing, the problems of American life are unbelievable. I am a history teacher, and I tell every audience that as a matter of history, not politics, as a matter of history, it is impossible to maintain American civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, 15-year-olds killing each other, 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, and 18-year-olds getting diplomas they cannot read. I don\u2019t think that is debatable. I think it is clear.\"\nMy speech has modeled on Reagan\u2019s statement on the Capitol Steps 14 years earlier. He said: \"Speaking personally, I can remember the many times in California when I reached out to members of the other party in order to pass important legislation. I know that all of us here today, as a team, will also seek close cooperation with the other side throughout our terms.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThe bipartisan appeal of the Contract with America can be seen in the voting pattern on the House floor.\u00a0\nThe specific Contract items averaged getting 63 Democrats voting with the House Republicans. I know this is the opposite of the news media mythology, so don\u2019t take my word for it. Here are the key votes in 1995:\n*H.R. 1, \"Congressional Accountability Act of 1995\" - 228 Republicans and 200 Democrats voted yea. 0 nay votes. 1 Independent voted yea, 4 Members not voting.\n*H.R. 2, \"Line Item Veto Act\" - 223 Republicans and 71 Democrats voted yea. 4 Republicans voted yea, 129 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent voted nay, 7 Members not voting.\n*H.R. 3, \"Taking Back Our Streets Act of 1995.\" The House passed elements of this package in:\n*H.R. 666, \"Exclusionary Rule Reform Act\" \u2013 220 Republicans and 69 Democrats voted yea, 7 Republicans and 134 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent nay, 3 Members Not\u00a0Voting;\n*H.R. 729, \"Effective Death Penalty Act\" \u2013 226 Republicans and 71 Democrats voted yea, 1 Republican and 130 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent nay, 5 Members not voting;\u00a0\n*H.R. 667, \"Violent Criminal Incarceration Act\" \u2013 206 Republicans and 59 Democrats voted yea, 20 Democrats and 135 Republicans voted nay. 1 Independent nay, 13 Members not voting;\u00a0\n\n*H.R. 728, \"Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act\" \u2013 220 Republicans and 18 Democrats voted yea, 9 Republicans and 182 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent nay, 5 Members not voting.\n*H.R. 4, \"Personal Responsibility Act of 1995\"(Welfare reform) - 225 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted yea, 5 Republicans and 193 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent voted nay, 2 Members not voting.\n*H.R 5, \"Unfunded Mandate Reform Act\" - 230 Republicans and 130 Democrats voted yea, 73 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent voted nay, 1 Member not voting.\n*H.R. 6, \"American Dream Restoration Act\" \u2013 passed as part of H.R. 1215, \"Contract With America Tax Relief Act\" \u2013 219 Republicans and 27 Democrats voted yea, 11 Republicans and 176 Democrat voted nay. 1 Independent voted nay, 1 Member not voting.\n*H.R. 7, \"National Security Revitalization Act\" - 223 Republicans and 18 Democrats voted yea, 4 Republicans and 176 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent voted nay, 13 Members not voting.\n*H.R. 8, \"Senior Citizens' Equity Act\" \u2013 also passed as part of H.R. 1215 noted above.\n*H.R. 9, \"Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995\" - 219 Republicans and 58 Democrats voted yea, 8 Republicans and 132 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent voted nay, 17 Members not voting.\n*H.R. 10, \"Securities Litigation Reform Act\" \u2013 elements passed in H.R. 1058, \"Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\" 226 Republicans and 99 Democrats voted yea, 0 Republicans and 98 Democrats voted nay. 1 Independent nay, 1 Present vote, 10 Members not voting.\n*H.J.Res.1, \"Proposing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\" \u2013 228 Republican and 72 Democratic yea, 2 Republican and 129 Democratic nays. 1 Independent nay, 3 Not Voting. \u00a0Passed 2/3 by a total vote of 300 to 132.\n*H.J.Res.73, \"Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States with respect to the number of terms of office of Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives\" \u2013 189 Republican and 38 Democratic yea, 40 Republican and 163 Democratic nay. 1 Independent nay; 1 Present and 3 Not Voting. Total vote of 227 to 204 failed to reach 2/3 required.\nOur bipartisan, American majority approach enabled House Republicans to survive the 1996 loss of the presidential campaign \u2013 and retain the majority for the first time since 1928. The American people endorsed the positive attitude, positive reforms, and focus on an American rather than a Republican agenda.\nThe ability to legislate with a bipartisan majority continued in 1997, when we moved to balance the federal budget (which succeeded in balancing for four years for the only time in your lifetime).\nWhen we initially passed H.R. 2015 - Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the initial vote was\u00a0 270 \u2013 162 (with 219 Republicans and 51 Democrats voting yes and 154 Democrats, 7 Republicans and 1 independent voting no).\nWhen the final balanced budget conference report came up, it passed by a vote of 346-85 (with 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats voting for the measure and 32 Republicans, 52 Democrats, and 1 Independent voting against it).\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe had achieved this line of bipartisan majorities for conservative reforms because we had followed the lesson of President Reagan and the strategies he had learned at General Electric.\u00a0\nIf you are determined to be an American majority, and you are committed to listening to and learning from the American people, it is amazing how much the grassroots will help you legislate in a bipartisan way.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH",

    "body": "WILMINGTON, Del., (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Thirty business leaders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have joined a letter to the three states' Congressional Delegations voicing their opposition to a drug-pricing bill currently before the House of Representatives, H.R. 3, and similar efforts in the U.S. Senate. Citing a recent study, these groups warned of a resulting regional job loss totaling 131,500 as well as $35.4 billion in lost economic output annually combined between the three states if the bill were enacted. In addition to the potential job and economic impact, the letter also forewarned of significant decreases in construction activity, tax revenue, charitable donations, vendor spending and other adverse consequences. \u201cNot only would H.R. 3 significantly harm our region's workforce and economy, it also would severely curtail the life sciences' ability to research and discover the next generation of vaccines, treatments and cures at a time when global human health needs them more than ever,\u201d said Michael Fleming, President of Delaware Bio ( www.delawarebio.org \u201cThis bill would dramatically reduce the nearly $100 billion the life sciences invests annually in R&D as they pursue new treatments and cures for some of the world's most dreaded diseases,\u201d said Dean J. Paranicas, President and Chief Executive Officer of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey ( www.hinj.org \u201cSimply put, H.R. 3 is bad for patients, bad for global health and bad for Pennsylvania's, Delaware's and New Jersey's economies,\u201d said Christopher P. Molineaux, President and Chief Executive Officer of Life Sciences Pennsylvania ( www.lifesciencespa.org The business leaders urged federal representatives in the three states to oppose H.R. 3 and instead focus on policies that will actually lower patients' out-of-pocket costs.

O'Brien sent letters to members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee urging them to oppose H.R. 471, the Safer Highways and Increased Performance for Interstate Trucking (SHIP IT) Act. The legislation, introduced by Representatives Jim Costa (CA-21) and Dusty Johnson (SD-AL), would jeopardize the safety of workers, motorists and any American that uses an interstate highway \u2013 all while doing nothing to address the root causes of our nation's supply chain woes.\n\nInternational Brotherhood Of Teamsters. (PRNewsFoto/International Brotherhood of Teamsters)\n\n\"Supply chain challenges and bottle necks over the last few years have laid bare a number of critical issues in the trucking industry, including the prevalence of poor working conditions, rampant and illegal misclassification of drivers under labor law, and the scourge of fly-by-night contracted and subcontracted motor carriers,\" O'Brien said in his letter to the U.S. House of Representatives. \"H.R. 471 looks to wrong and dangerous short-term 'solutions' to the very real legal and economic issues present in commercial trucking.\"\n\nThe SHIP IT Act would allow for the introduction of heavier, more dangerous trucks on the road that are prone to more frequent and more severe crashes. It would also grant the Secretary of Transportation unjustifiable authority on size and weight requirements and gut fatigue protections for drivers carrying agricultural goods.\n\n\"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters welcomes important conversations about improving the trucking industry \u2013 for both drivers and the American consumer,\" O'Brien said. \"However, H.R. 471 is simply an anti-safety bill in sheep's clothing.\"\n\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.2 million hardworking men and women throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, on Wednesday compared House Democrats to the \"devil\" for authoring and passing major democracy reform and voting rights legislation known as HR 1.\u00a0\n\"Everything about this bill is rotten to the core,\" Lee told Fox News of the legislative package. \"This is a bill as if written in hell by the devil himself.\"\u00a0\nHR 1, which is also known as the For the People Act and passed the House largely along party lines earlier this month, would reform campaign finance, set stricter rules for lobbyists, and widen access to voting, including by expanding voter registration, mail and early voting, and election security measures.\u00a0\nThe senator said he disagrees with \"every single word in H.R. 1, including the words 'but,' 'and,' and 'the'\" and argued that Congress is attempting to undermine state control over elections \"in an effort to ensure an institutional, revolutionary Democratic Party of sorts, one that can remain in power for many decades to come.\"\u00a0\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \"This takes all sorts of decisions that the federal government, really, has no business making \u2014 takes them away from the states, makes them right here in Washington, DC by Congress,\" he went on.\u00a0\nWhile the Constitution delegates most of the authority over elections to the states, it still has the power to oversee and pass legislation concerning the administration of federal elections.\u00a0\nCongress has previously passed major, nationwide election reform legislation in bills including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.\u00a0\nBecause the Senate filibuster requires a 60-vote majority to pass legislation, H.R. 1 faces serious challenges to passage in the upper chamber.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        Some voting rights advocates, including powerful Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, have argued that the Senate filibuster should be reformed to allow civil and voting rights legislation like H.R. 1 to be more easily adopted.\u00a0\nH.R. 1 requires states to enact online, automatic, and same-day voter registration and to give voting rights to the formerly incarcerated, and softens voter ID laws by allowing voters to sign sworn affidavits instead of showing an ID. It is already a federal crime to lie about your identity while casting a ballot.\nThe bill also requires all states to hold 15 days of early voting as well as no-excuse mail voting while offering online ballot tracking, prepaid postage, and the option for voters to return their ballots at drop boxes.\nNotably, many of H.R. 1's provisions are already in place in Utah, which Lee represents and has won two statewide elections in over the past decade. Utah has online and same-day voter registration, offered two weeks of early voting in most counties in 2020, and has a non-strict non-photo ID law that allows voters to sign an affidavit if they don't have the required ID.\u00a0\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        And beginning in 2018, Utah has sent all registered voters a mail-in ballot, which goes beyond H.R. 1's requirement for states to simply allow voters to request a ballot without an excuse.",

Kurt Schrader from Oregon, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, drafted a narrower alternative to the more sweeping measure favored by the liberal wing of the party, known as H.R. 3, that would allow the government to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. GOP lawmakers have long opposed direct negotiation of drug prices, saying that doing so would stifle innovation of future cures and treatments.The rival legislation from Peters and Schrader would \u201cpreserve innovation\u201d by giving the government narrower negotiating power for drugs that have no other competitors on the market. Peters also has support from Democratic Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York, Lou Correa of California, and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.BIDEN RELEASES PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN THAT WOULD LET GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICESWhile H.R. 3 would cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors under Medicare at $2,000, Peters's legislation would adjust the cap on out-of-pocket costs with income, ranging from $1,200 to $3,100, so that the poorest seniors enrolled in the government healthcare program would get the greatest amount of assistance.Peters said in a statement Tuesday that he looked forward to working with his Democratic colleagues to \u201cachieve reforms that help patients, support future innovation and grow American jobs.\u201dHouse Democrats first passed H.R. 3, or the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, in December 2019, but it stalled before getting a vote in the then-majority-GOP Senate. The Congressional Budget Office, a federal agency that provides economic advice to Congress, estimated that the price negotiation provision in H.R. 3 could save the federal government more than $456 billion over a decade. The CBO has not yet issued an updated score for the Peters bill or for other healthcare proposals being pushed by Democrats in this Congress, such as expanded benefits under Medicare to include hearing, dental, and vision coverage.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The Energy and Commerce Committee reconvened Tuesday morning to debate the Democrats\u2019 drug price negotiation proposal, which the party plans to include in the $3.5 trillion social infrastructure package known as the Build Back Better Act in the House.

    "body": "H.R. 1 , the For the People Act, and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, are commonly framed as bills to reform our democracy. But they're also key to our economic future. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right For our country to succeed economically, our market-based system must function alongside strong, effective government. Strong, effective government, in turn, requires a functioning democratic process. By repairing our democracy, H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 could pave the way for policies that achieve the interdependent objectives of strong growth, widespread economic well-being and reduced inequality. These bills are so important that if they can garner majority support, Senate rules should be changed so that they can be passed even without 60 votes. Faith in democracy and faith in markets go hand in hand. People support pro-growth policies when they believe they will share in the benefits of growth. For these benefits to be widely shared, we need an inclusive growth policy agenda. This can be achieved only if elected officials feel accountable to the broader public. And there is broad accountability only if voting is widespread. H.R. 1 expands the ease and accessibility of voting. Under the bill , Americans would automatically be registered to vote when they apply for state services. States would also be required to allow voters to register online. The legislation would implement universal voting by mail; provide at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections in every state; and, wherever possible, make polling places located adjacent to public transportation. The bills also include new campaign finance measures, such as improved disclosures and small-dollar matching, that would give voice to lower- and middle-income people and help ensure that income inequality does not translate as readily into political inequality, and vice versa. This legislation could also serve as a balm for our increasingly polarized politics. H.R. 1 bans partisan gerrymandering and requires the use of independent commissions to draw congressional districts. Mapping rules would be made consistent throughout the country, and the public would have a chance to review the maps and comment before they are finalized. Districts that heavily favor one party could become competitive again, and each side would be incentivized to win a broad majority of voters \u2014 not simply a vocal sliver of primary voters. When elected officials believe it's in their self-interest to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, they are more likely to ground decisions in facts and analysis and to engage in principled compromise. They are also more resistant to the pull of populism and nationalism. H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 would be worthy priorities under any circumstances. But we are not facing any circumstances. The current political moment makes protecting the democratic process not merely important but absolutely crucial. Over the past decade, a rash of laws suppressing the vote has advanced across the country. Such efforts have accelerated since the 2020 election . As of last month, more than 250 such bills were pending in 43 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice These vote-restricting laws could render the political process unable to correct itself. That means our choice isn't between reforming our democracy now or reforming it later: It's between reforming our democracy now and not being able to reform our democracy because it's too late. Ideally, H.R. 1, which the House of Representatives passed this month , and H.R. 4, a version of which the House passed in 2019, would pass with wide bipartisan majorities after a traditional Senate debate. But if the bills don't garner 60 votes, yet a majority is ready to pass these bills into law, the Senate should declare that H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 are so important that the 60-vote threshold for breaking a filibuster and ending debate should no longer apply to them, regardless of where senators stand on the broader question of eliminating or reforming the filibuster altogether. In business, government and life, bad processes inevitably lead to bad outcomes. The process by which our leaders are elected is broken and growing worse. Repairing that electoral process \u2014 if necessary, by bypassing the legislative filibuster \u2014 isn't just about abstract ideas of fairness and equality. It's also an essential act to advance policies that improve Americans' well-being, thereby strengthening the foundation of both our democracy and our market economy.

    "body": "Comedian Sarah Silverman is the latest celebrity urging Congress to pass H.R. 1, the so-called \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d that would gut voter identification requirements, protect illegal immigrants, and federalize election oversight by seizing power from states.\n\nSarah Silverman created a video message for RepresentUs, a self-described \u201cpost-partisan\u201d group whose stated goal is to ensure electoral integrity. The organization has aggressively pushed for mass-mail voting, claiming it will make elections safer and more inclusive.\n\n\u201cYou gotta ask yourself: What kind of politician wants to keep people from voting?\u201d Silverman said in the video. \u201cI mean, make no mistake about it, these fucked up voter suppression laws that are popping up everywhere state by state, they\u2019re not because of voter fraud. They\u2019re because of voter turnout.\u201d\n\nShe also urged senators to stop being \u201cassholes\u201d and vote for the bill.\n\nSilverman is the latest in a slew of left-wing Hollywood celebrities who have publicly supported H.R. 1. while slamming so-called \u201cvoter suppression\u201d laws in states including Georgia and Florida.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, H.R. 1 is designed to\u00a0nationalize elections and make permanent changes to voting rules, which would virtually ensure Democrat victories in perpetuity. In\u00a0a recent interview on PBS\u2019 NewsHour, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) admitted Democrats will have a better chance of holding the House in 2022 if H.R.1. becomes law.\n\nThe bill also\u00a0protects illegal immigrants from prosecution if they are registered to vote automatically and never made an affirmative declaration that they were U.S. citizens.\n\nLast year, Represent Us executive director Josh Silver urged people to \u201cpush against\u201d then-President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric against mass-mail voting. Silver erroneously claimed\u00a0voting by mail is the same thing as absentee voting.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, the two are not the same.\u00a0Universal mail-in voting doesn\u2019t require a voter to request a ballot. Instead, registered voters are mailed a ballot unsolicited.\u00a0By contrast, absentee voting requires a voter to request an absentee ballot before election day.\n\nThe House has already approved H.R. 1 but the bill is facing headwinds in the Senate, including from\u00a0Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV).\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter\u00a0@HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at\u00a0dng@breitbart.com.",

    "body": "refusing to pass gun-control measures and called for changes to the filibuster to enable gun legislation by the Democratic-led House to reach the floor.  Speaking to her constituents of New York's 14th congressional district during a town hall, Ocasio-Cortez said \u201cwe need to finish the job\u201d on gun control and pass measures that have cleared the House. These include H.R. 8 \u2014 a measure that would make background checks stricter \u2014 as well as H.R. 1808, which would ban \u201csemiautomatic assault weapons,\u201d and H.R. 1454, which would expand the definition of firearms to include custom-built firearms (termed \u201cghost guns\u201d).  Ocasio-Cortez said the bills had not advanced in the Senate because of Democratic senators Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), who have refused to consider reforms to the Senate cloture (filibuster) rule \u2014 which requires 60 votes to limit debate and move to a vote on nonbudgetary legislation. She added that \u201ca carve-out on the filibuster for H.R. 8\u201d was necessary, allowing it to be passed without reaching the 60-vote threshold.  \u201cThis is not just a Republican problem. We have obstructionists,\u201d she said of her own party in a reference to Manchin and Sinema, before accusing them of letting \u201cblood spill\u201d in favor of the filibuster. \u201cAll this blood is spilling, and yet the filibuster is more important\u201d to the two senators, she said.  \u201cThey are complicit in the violence,\u201d she added, \u201cand I will not make excuses for Democratic senators who refuse to act on this issue.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez then repeated her call for the Senate to \u201celiminate or amend\u201d the filibuster.  Ocasio-Cortez also took aim at Manchin's response to the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, where \u2014 after attending a bipartisan meeting on gun legislation \u2014 he reportedly said in relation to proposals on gun reform that \u201cit feels different right now,\u201d \u2014 an apparent departure from his to the House's gun legislation. Citing these comments, she said of Manchin and Sinema: \u201cThey said the same thing after Parkland and the same thing after Sandy Hook. . . . I'm sick of them.\u201d  Story continues  Moreover, Ocasio-Cortez accused both senators, as well as other Democrats, of receiving \u201cdark money\u201d from political interest groups to maintain the Senate's filibuster rules. In reference to the shooting at Robb Elementary School, she said \u201c19 babies' lives\u201d were \u201cnot worth the dark money they are receiving to preserve the filibuster; I want to say that very directly.\u201d  According to reporting by the New York Times , both Manchin and Sinema have received money from , which have opposed gun restrictions proposed by congressional Democrats. At the time of this writing, neither Manchin's nor Sinema's offices had responded to National Review 's requests for comment.  During her town hall, Ocasio-Cortez addressed a variety of topics, including inflation, congressional redistricting in New York, and Puerto Rican statehood. She announced that she would be visiting Puerto Rico to conduct \u201cfield hearings\u201d on legislation to approve a binding plebiscite for the territory, to seek either statehood or independence from the United States.  Responding to a question about controlling inflation, she said inflation has been \u201cout of control\u201d this year. However, she said the \u201cactual inflation rate\u201d should be measured as \u201caround 3 percent,\u201d instead of the 8.5 percent reflected in the , because corporations are \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of current economic conditions.

    "body": "H.R. 1 is poised to be the most important democracy reform enacted by Congress since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But in the wake of its passage in the House on a strict party-line vote on March 3, some anxious scholars and pundits worry it cannot pass the Senate and are urging Democrats to pull back. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right That advice is wholly misguided, both politically and morally. This is not the time to compromise on H.R. 1. It is not time for Democrats to negotiate against themselves. This is the time to make the argument for every facet of H.R. 1 even more strongly. H.R. 1 is an omnibus reform package that covers a wide range of flaws in our current representative democracy. Building on the work of the late representative John Lewis, the bill would assure that every qualified voter had equal freedom to vote, and that no state could deploy complex rules to suppress anyone's right to participate. It would end the partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, increase election security and, for the first time in U.S. history, give candidates for Congress a real opportunity to rely on small contributors alone to fund their campaigns. The bill would also impose substantial ethics regulations on Congress, the Supreme Court and the president. And it would be funded by fines, penalties and settlements from corporate tax, lobbying and financial fraud cases. The breadth of its ambition is a strength, not weakness. Americans are deeply skeptical of their government. Overwhelmingly, they believe that Congress serves not them, but the special interests who pay for campaigns. Many are deeply and rightly angry at the efforts by states to suppress their vote . Others are frustrated with legislatures that draw districts to permanently entrench a political minority as a majority. And practically everyone thinks that every branch of our government must commit to higher ethical ideals. We are told we have the greatest democracy in the world. Yet very few who know anything about how it actually functions believe this. H.R. 1 responds to these frustrations by addressing each aspect directly. Not every American is concerned with every part. But any American awake to political reality is convinced of at least part. Voters in Iowa are less concerned with gerrymandering \u2014 because that doesn't happen in Iowa. But many voters in Iowa are appalled by a campaign funding system that just gave them the second-most-expensive Senate race in U.S. history, with 75 percent of the money coming from outside the state. The strategy of H.R. 1 is to address the common perception that our government doesn't work for us, even if the particular flaws that might anger any group of citizens may be different. If H.R. 1 gets dismembered, this common purpose disappears. Yes, of course, Congress should address the growing problem of vote suppression. But if that's all it addresses, many members have less cause to champion it. Congress should address gerrymandering, but Iowa Michigan, Arizona, California, and Ohio already have, and so the urgency is less for their representatives. Practically every American laments the corrupting influence of money in politics, but why should voters in districts without adequate polling places worry about how campaigns are funded? We all see problems with our democracy, but the problems we all see are not the same. Mistaken pragmatists, however, insist that Democrats should satisfy themselves with reforms in voting rights and possibly gerrymandering. They would abandon reforms in campaign finance and transparency, as well as ethics. But no voter is going to turn against a representative because they've passed ethics reform. And a key potential swing vote in the Senate right now has been a longtime advocate of campaign finance and transparency reform. As governor of West Virginia, Joe Manchin III (D) pressed the state to publicly fund judicial elections. As a U.S. senator, Manchin has been a longtime co-sponsor of campaign finance reform in Congress as well, observing that \u201cthe people of West Virginia are also deeply troubled by the increasing role that money is playing in our politics.\u201d In that same speech, Manchin lamented the time that members must spend raising money from a very few number of large donors \u2014 one of the problems that H.R. 1 addresses. There's no doubt that passing H.R. 1 will be difficult and could be blocked by the filibuster. But it is a mistake to believe that going smaller would make it easier. Instead, what we need now is a clear articulation of the very simple principle that stands behind everything in this bill \u2014 that in a representative democracy, the institutions of that democracy must be representative. Ours are not. Without the reforms of H.R. 1, our precariously majoritarian system will become predictably minoritarian. And for that, there is neither moral nor political justification, let alone strategic wisdom. Read more: Robert E. Rubin: H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 would reform our democracy. They'd also help our economy.

    "body": "Outraged, he used this platform to plead with Senate Republicans to move forward on a years-long legislative effort that would require background checks on all gun sales: H.R. 8.  The bill, also known as the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, was championed by Democrats after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting that left 26 dead nearly a decade ago and passed by the House in 2021. But it has since languished in the Senate for more than a year.  \u201cThere's 50 senators, right now, who refuse to vote on H.R. 8,\u201d Kerr said. Kerr \u2014 a longtime gun-control advocate whose father was shot to death in 1984 \u2014 had biting words for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his Republican colleagues: \u201cThere's a reason they won't vote on it: to hold on to power.\u201d  Now calls are mounting for H.R. 8's passage amid public outrage over the deadliest mass shooting at an American school in nearly a decade. But legal and firearms experts are not optimistic the bill will become law, even after the tragedy in Uvalde, Tex.  \u201cWhen similar legislation failed after Sandy Hook, despite sky-high popular support among the public, I think it left a lot of advocates pessimistic,\u201d Jake Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University School of Law, told The Washington Post. \u201cThat doesn't mean this time won't be different, but I suspect that's the concern.\u201d  In a nod to the uphill battle ahead, Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday that the chamber would not quickly vote on either H.R. 8 or H.R. 1446, which would close what's known as the \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d that allows some licensed gun sales to be completed before a background check is finished. While delaying a vote could give Democrats and Republicans more time to hash out a possible deal, Schumer expressed skepticism that the Senate would get the votes needed to pass the bill into law.  \u201cMy Republican colleagues can work with us now,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI know this is a slim prospect, very slim, all too slim \u2014 we've been burned so many times before \u2014 but this is so important.\u201d  After Texas tragedy, Schumer says Democrats will negotiate on guns  H.R. 8 would close a loophole that does not require background checks in transactions involving unlicensed and private sellers, such as purchases online or at gun shows. The bill is considered to be among the first major new firearm restrictions to advance in Congress in a generation.  \u201cIt's a bill that we have to pass. It's not an option to give up,\u201d Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), a longtime supporter of the legislation sponsoring the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 in the House, told The Post on Wednesday. \u201cWe've got 19 more reasons yesterday why it's not an option to give up.\u201d  In the Uvalde shooting's aftermath, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deflected criticism that the state's lax gun laws put students at risk. At a news conference Wednesday, Abbott downplayed the shooter's relatively easy access to firearms, pointing out that residents 18 and older have been legally allowed to buy long guns \u2014 a category that includes the style of gun used in the Uvalde shooting \u2014 for more than 60 years. The governor also speculated that the alleged shooter, who authorities say legally purchased a pair of semiautomatic rifles recently, probably suffered from mental illness \u2014 although he said authorities found no mental health record.  Weakened gun laws put Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the defensive  Thompson said the outline of H.R. 8 was first sketched in the days after the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn. After Congress proposed a bipartisan bill in 2013 that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers and banned assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines, more than 50 senators, including some Republicans, signaled their support and gave observers hope that the measure could pass.  When it failed to get the necessary votes to pass, President Barack Obama lashed out at gun-rights groups and senators who voted against the bill, saying its defeat in the spring of 2013 amounted to \u201c a pretty shameful day for Washington .\u201d  Proposals on background checks did not pass the House chamber again until Democrats regained control years later. In 2019, the House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act , which called for expanding federal background checks for gun purchases and transfer, by a vote of 240 to 190, with mostly Democrats and eight Republicans.  Yet the 2019 bill died in committee in the Senate, with Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), then the majority whip, noting at the time it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that a House gun bill would get Senate consideration as long as Republicans were in control of the chamber. President Donald Trump made a veto threat if it did somehow get passed by the Senate.  \u201cIt went to the Senate where it languished,\u201d Thompson said.  There was renewed optimism last year when Democrats regained slim control of the Senate to go along with their majority in the House. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 passed the House last year by a vote of 227 to 203 \u2014 another largely Democrat-heavy vote with the support of eight Republicans. But this version of the background-check bill has again gone without a vote, as it remains unlikely to pass.  If a vote were held today, Thompson said, \u201cI'm assuming we'd have 50 votes.\u201d  \u201cThe problem is you don't have 10 Republican senators courageous enough to allow the bill to come up for the vote,\u201d he said.  The Senate's sponsor of the bill, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), expressed his anger on Tuesday and pleaded with his colleagues to find a way to put politics aside and work together to stop the carnage of mass shootings.  After Uvalde, angry Democrats assail GOP over resistance to gun laws  \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Murphy said, his voice raised. \u201cWhy are we here if not to try and make sure fewer schools and few communities go through what Sandy Hook has gone through, what Uvalde is going through. \u2026 I am here on this floor to beg, to literally get down on my hands and knees and beg my colleagues: Find a path forward here. Work with us to find a way to pass laws that make this less likely.\u201d  So far, Republicans have not given any indication whether they will engage in a potential compromise on H.R. 8. McConnell called the Texas shooting the work of a \u201cderanged young man\u201d and asked for prayers on Wednesday but did not mention any possible legislative action. GOP senators like Thune suggested that a potential Republican response could be centered \u201caround the issue of mental health,\u201d while Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), said they hoped lawmakers would look at legislation to improve school security.  Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said it would be wise for states to adopt red-flag laws \u2014 which would enable law enforcement, if given a court order, to seize guns from someone considered a danger to themselves or others. Romney also suggested he supported background checks.  \u201cBackground checks and updating our background check technology is something that I think is an appropriate federal responsibility,\u201d he said in a statement.  Schumer is urging Americans who want H.R. 8 to pass to vote gun control-resistant legislators out of office. But Eugene Volokh, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and an expert on constitutional law and gun-control laws, argued that voters and legislators might not think a background-check law would do much to help curb school shootings.  \u201cI think most voters would say this background-check bill is not really connected to mass shootings, other than being connecting to the general subject of guns,\u201d Volokh said. \u201cWhile you can never say never on a compromise, there isn't a real appetite on the left or the right to make compromise.\u201d  For his part, Thompson said he's grateful to see public figures outside politics turning attention to the issue. In addition to Kerr, another member of the Warriors \u2014 Damion Lee \u2014 told reporters that it's currently \u201c easier to get a gun than baby formula .\u201d  \u201cI'm furious. I'm heartbroken. I'm saddened. I'm frustrated,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis is not rocket science.\u201d  Mike DeBonis, Colby Itkowitz, Marianna Sotomayor, David Nakamura and Karin Brulliard contributed to this report.",

    "body": "year, according to the annual Future of Work report from Monster. Will your organization make a strong comeback or suffer from the same status-quo strategies that plagued it before COVID?As a CEO and the author of Why Simple Wins, I\u2019ve studied the effects of complexity on employees and leaders \u2014 and witnessed a familiar pattern, regardless of industry. New hires at all levels enter with high hopes and energy. For the first six months, they\u2019re eager to contribute and willing to challenge any system or process that slows them down. But after a year or so, when they realize the full weight of the complexity they\u2019re up against, they become increasingly frustrated and defeated. From here, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they exit stage left.If a constantly revolving door describes your company, explore the short Q&A related to Human Resources below. Organizations of any size can use it, from start-ups to multinational corporations, and it should be completed by the CHRO, head of H.R. or another relevant leader with the power to make change. Your answers will reveal how complicated your H.R. ecosystem is \u2014 and where the traffic jams are. From there, you\u2019ll discuss with your team and determine solutions.Start by answering the following five statements with either \u201cConsistently,\u201d \u201cSometimes,\u201d \u201cRarely\u201d or \u201cNever.\u201d Answer individually and be ruthlessly honest in your assessments.1. I can explain my and my colleagues\u2019 roles in one or two jargon-free sentences.2. When I hire/my team hires a qualified candidate, excessive levels of approval are not required.3. I believe that this organization rewards employees simplification efforts.4. Performance reviews here are easy to complete.5. Performance reviews here are meaningful and help employees improve their performance.To tally points, use this scorecard for each answer:\u00b7 \u201cConsistently\u201d = 0\u00b7 \u201cSometimes\u201d = 1 point\u00b7 \u201cRarely\u201d = 2 points\u00b7 \u201cNever\u201d = 3 pointsIf you calculated 1 to 4 points, you\u2019ve got pockets of complexity. Your H.R. department is functional but at least one \u201cRarely\u201d or \u201cNever\u201d answer may be reducing productivity or complicating your onboard strategy.If your sum is 5 to 9 points, your H.R. department is showing symptoms of complexity. Results and valuable work have lapsed into policies and processes, and if left unchecked, the red tape will creep into every aspect of H.R. and the rest of your company.If you scored 10 to 14 points, your H.R. department has a major complexity problem. It\u2019s likely that the entire organization is suffering from complacency, possibly even at the C-suite level, and core values have been replaced by frustration and fear. From meetings and hiring to incentive programs and technology, nothing is easy to accomplish.Lastly, if you tallied a sum of 15, H.R. has officially reached dangerous levels of complexity. It\u2019s paralyzed your ability to recruit talent and is likely affecting every other aspect of your business. Resources are presumably being wasted on a massive scale, yet employees are numb to it. Some aspects of H.R. may not be functioning at all, putting your entire business at risk of failure.Now, share the diagnosis and five statements with your teams via email and ask them to generate the likely reasons why complexity has hijacked H.R. \u2014 and their ideas for simplifying. Then schedule a remote meeting to discuss both reasons and solutions, which should be captured on a virtual whiteboard.After discussing the feasibility of solutions, take a vote on which to implement immediately \u2014 and do it. Examples of solutions might include \u201celiminate annual performance reviews\u201d or \u201cdefine roles by outcomes, not tasks\u201d and \u201coverhaul our onboarding program.\u201d To establish accountability, publicly assign the tasks related to the solutions to people or teams along with completion dates.The past year has been enormously draining on H.R. professionals. From keeping our employees safe and helping them navigate unemployment or transition to remote work, we owe H.R. a debt of gratitude. If you have the power to remove complexity from their work lives and simplify routine tasks, don\u2019t hesitate. The benefits of improved morale and employee empowerment will have a ripple effect that starts in H.R. and spreads across your business.",

    "body": "On June 8, ProPublica published a \u201cbombshell\u201d report that was shared by many Democrats and media figures. The story details what ProPublica characterizes as troubling tax avoidance by the twenty-five richest Americans, and on top of this, the article falsely declares that the wealthy in the United States \u201caren\u2019t paying their fair share.\u201d\n The most troubling part of ProPublica\u2019s purported expos\u00e9 isn\u2019t actually the information it reveals, it\u2019s how that information was obtained. Billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk legally reduced their tax burden by exploiting loopholes in a deeply flawed tax code. But the unlawful leak of these Internal Revenue Service (IRS) documents is an unprecedented breach of privacy, and shows that no American is safe from targeting by left-wing bureaucrats.\n This is exactly why legislation like H.R. 1, which has been relentlessly promoted by President Biden and his leftist allies, is so dangerous. Among other provisions, H.R. 1 would require organizations involved in \u201ccampaign-related disbursements\u201d to disclose the names of donors who give $10,000 or more.\n While Democrats claim this is meant to root out corruption, it would prevent countless Americans from participating in the political process due to fear of harassment. Intimidation of Americans due to their political affiliation is something that leftists have tried before, and they aren\u2019t shy about their desire to do it again. Illegal leaks from the IRS to ProPublica offer a sneak peek at what Americans would face if H.R. 1 was passed. The disclosure of donor lists would open up millions of people who participate in our civic process to ridicule.\n Even the liberal American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has pointed out that political donors could face threats of harassment or violence if their information is released. Individuals and groups of all political stripes know that the disclosure of donor rolls under H.R. 1 would violate privacy rights and scare our fellow citizens out of donating to political causes.\n   With politics growing more heated by the day, encouraging harassment of Americans for their views, and their donations to groups which represent those views, is the last thing we should be doing. All of us should feel free to engage in the civic process without fear of retribution or intimidation. When we become too scared to make our voices heard, we\u2019re no longer a free country.\n But the left is more than happy to drift in this direction, so long as it allows them to consolidate their power. Although H.R. 1 seems unlikely to pass given Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s vow to vote against the bill, this is far from the end of the road for legislation that would require the disclosure of donor rolls. There\u2019s no doubt Democrats will continue to support any effort to scare Americans out of donating to conservative groups.\n ProPublica is being cheered by the left for reporting the illegally leaked tax records of wealthy Americans, but the real scandal here isn\u2019t actually tax avoidance. ProPublica\u2019s story successfully exposed what we should be more concerned about: the stunning incompetence, and potential malice, of liberal bureaucrats within the IRS.\n Americans must continue to fight against H.R. 1 and any legislation that requires the disclosure of donor lists. If millions of conservatives are too scared to raise their voices, the far left will use our silence to solidify their grip on power, and our country will be lost.\n \n Noah Wall is an executive vice president at FreedomWorks.",

    "body": "Electrocution, convulsion, possession, all of the above, all at once. That\u2019s what it looks like, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s H.R., frontman of Bad Brains, leading his untouchable hardcore punk band through a blazing three-night stand at New York\u2019s CBGB in December 1982 during which various forces appear to be guiding his body: electric currents, neural misfires, holy spirits. But there\u2019s only one force at work here, music, and he\u2019s channeling it through the entirety of his physical form until total abandon and complete self-awareness seem to conjoin. Is that what freedom is?\n This all happens inside the 60 minutes of \u201cBad Brains Live at CBGB 1982,\u201d which doesn\u2019t really play like a concert film so much as camcorder evidence of a supernatural event repeated three times within 72 hours. We need footage like this to exist. Otherwise, we might not fully believe the eyewitnesses who still describe Bad Brains as the greatest live band to ever visit our plane.\n  That said, we probably wouldn\u2019t dismiss believers as the kind of people who saw the Virgin Mary in their toast, either. That\u2019s because the two indomitable albums that Bad Brains dropped in this era \u2014 a self-titled debut from 1982 and 1983\u2019s \u201cRock For Light,\u201d both being self-reissued this year along with most of the band\u2019s \u201980s output \u2014 are crammed with anthems of exhilarating speed, secret finesse, deep purpose and immutable optimism. The world has sped up over the past four decades, but this music still feels fast. In increasingly hyperbolic times, it remains extraordinary.\n And from those fortunate enough to have caught it in the air between 1979 and 1983, the testimony is practically unanimous. \u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like them,\u201d said Denise Mercedes, guitarist of the Stimulators, describing her first Bad Brains show in the pages of \u201cNYHC,\u201d Tony Rettman\u2019s oral history of New York hardcore. \u201cThe moment that they hit, it was like a bomb going off. It was louder, it was faster.\u201d\n So, an explosion? That might describe Bad Brains\u2019 kinetic power as a physical sensation, but it doesn\u2019t fully account for the music\u2019s meaning. And as detonative as their songs felt, this band wasn\u2019t destroying anything. Instead, they were inventing a powerful sound that adhered to their foundational credo of \u201cpositive mental attitude,\u201d a can-do concept that H.R. had borrowed from the popular 1937 self-help tract \u201cThink And Grow Rich.\u201d The group\u2019s advocacy for that mind-set, abbreviated in H.R.\u2019s lyrics as \u201cP.M.A.,\u201d registered in bright contrast to the nihilistic gloom that clouded the dawn of the punk era. Instead of shouting at an impending apocalypse, Bad Brains seemed to be barreling their way toward whatever might come after.\n These albums teem with other cosmic contradictions, too. The songs sound furious and ecstatic, the performances feel raw and precise, and all together, what seems like a molten volatility ultimately cools into a sustained act of supreme control. The only unambiguous feature of the Bad Brains\u2019 sound is speed.\n     Bad Brains, circa 1981, pictured from left: Dr. Know (Gary Miller), H.R. (Paul Hudson), Earl Hudson (front) and Darryl Jenifer. (Glen E. Friedman from the book \u201cMy Rules\u201d)  \n Tempo is a clockable thing. It\u2019s a quantitative way to try to understand music\u2019s qualitative mysteries. But with Bad Brains, speed is something to commit your attention to, even if you\u2019ve heard the songs 500 times. There\u2019s a nonperishable generosity to music that moves this fast. It can reveal new information each time it races by.\n Still, it\u2019s easy to get dazed by the simple physical feat of it. Imagine four Olympians sprinting 100-meters in lockstep toward a photo-finish tie for gold and you\u2019re starting to get a picture of the kinesthetic telepathy between guitarist Gary \u201cDr. Know\u201d Miller, bassist Darryl Jenifer, drummer Earl Hudson and his older brother H.R. (born Paul Hudson). According to the band, Earl set the tempo, starting the songs with a simple four count, but in Bad Brains nobody leads, nobody chases, nobody hurries ahead, nobody lags behind. Speed becomes an expression of collectivity. Or maybe even a virtue.\n In terms of a career, the quartet didn\u2019t get off to the quickest start. Bad Brains formed in Washington in the late \u201970s, first as Mind Power, a jazz fusion group inspired by Chick Corea and Mahavishnu Orchestra, but eventually changed its name and vision after discovering the Sex Pistols and the Damned. Hoping to combine those British sneers with the radiance of Jamaican reggae, they proceeded to make an unprecedented noise that would inspire the D.I.Y. ethos of Minor Threat and their peers, quickly making Washington the epicenter of American hardcore.\n When Bad Brains relocated to New York in 1981, they kick-started the scene there, too, then spent the rest of the decade dodging fame. One of the band\u2019s earliest managers, Mo Sussman, shopped the group to major labels as \u201cthe Black Beatles,\u201d but the band had already developed a phobia of the fine-print on record contracts \u2014 especially H.R., whose mercurial behavior foreshadowed his later struggles with mental health. Later in the \u201980s, when H.R. reportedly skipped out on a meeting with Chris Blackwell, the Island Records founder credited with launching Bob Marley and U2, it seemed like Bad Brains would remain an off-and-on proposition.\n Back in 1981, the band was still all the way on, at least onstage. \u201cThe way the world was moving in that era was making all of us play faster,\u201d Jenifer, the band\u2019s most discreet virtuoso, told Filter magazine in 2007. \u201cWe intended to play fast, but not as fast as we morphed into playing. We were only speeding up with the times, the motion of the whole scene.\u201d\n    The front cover of Bad Brains\u2019 1982 self-titled album. (Bad Brains)  \n  That\u2019s one way to survive on a planet that\u2019s spinning too fast: Outpace it. You can hear the band winning the race on their self-titled debut, something they recorded quickly and erratically across the spring, summer and fall of 1981 at 171-A, a four-track recording studio and performance space on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side where the band sometimes lived and rehearsed. The results sound as bright, scorching and unrepeatable as that lightning bolt striking the Capitol dome drawn on the album\u2019s iconic cover. It\u2019s the kind of record that forms a permanent crease in your memory the moment you first encounter it.\n Listen for the 501st time and you\u2019ll hear new sparks shooting off it, too. For instance, ever notice that the most torrential moments of Dr. Know\u2019s guitar solos tend to move up the fretboard like a rainstorm in reverse? Or how at the end of an especially locomotive burst of words, H.R. likes to curl his last syllable into a vertical shriek? Now listen to the rhythm section and try to imagine that 100-meter dash again, only this time at a 45-degree incline. Velocity is speed plus direction. This is ascension music \u2014 a sound rising in the direction of higher consciousness.\n    H.R. of Bad Brains does a backflip onstage at CBGB in Manhattan, circa 1982. (Glen E. Friedman from the book \u201cMy Rules\u201d)  \n It seems absurd that a book like \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d had any kind of formative influence over a developing punk scene skeptical of capitalism, spirituality and the notion of hope in general, but everything about Bad Brains seemed to defy the odds. Written during the Great Depression by failed businessman Napoleon Hill, the book offered techniques for amassing personal wealth through positive thinking, and its success as perennial bestseller helped to establish the entire concept of American self-help \u2014 an optimism industry that Barbara Ehrenreich meticulously debunks in her 2009 book \u201cBright-Sided: How Positive Thinking is Undermining America.\u201d Ehrenreich describes \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d as one of the \u201cclassics of self-delusion\u201d designed to \u201charness the subconscious mind to conscious greed.\u201d\n H.R. allegedly latched onto the idea of \u201cpositive mental attitude\u201d by complete accident, pulling the book off his father\u2019s bookshelf after an argument about the direction of his life. In \u201cFinding Joseph I,\u201d a 2017 biography of H.R. by Howie Abrams and James Lathos, the singer described the band\u2019s abiding ideology as swirl of tenacious self-improvement and wishful clairvoyance: \u201cI think the philosophy was to have something positive to say \u2014 have some kind of prophetic message that would prove to people that we could do something better.\u201d\n  What kept Bad Brains\u2019 P.M.A. from evaporating into hardcore woo-woo was the band\u2019s ability to shape reality, to transpose its optimism into a sound that literally moved people \u2014 including H.R., who occasionally punctuated his bandmate\u2019s nonstop sound-gestures by landing backflips onstage, something he first practiced as a child while swimming in the ocean. That physicality extended to the audience, too. Before it became ritualized, slam-dancing emerged as an instinctual response to hardcore punk, and the term \u201cmosh\u201d is believed to originate from Bad Brains speaking in reggae slang and Jamaican patois from up onstage, asking the crowd to \u201cmash it up.\u201d\n In all that push and shove, a sort of End Times optimism began to foment around the Bad Brains. The band grew more fervent in its spirituality and had fully adopted Rastafarianism by 1982 with H.R. singing about the fall of Babylon, a biblical concept that dovetailed neatly with the doom-saying so common to punk at the outset of the Reagan era. Just as he had repurposed Hill\u2019s pseudo-metaphysical greed mantra into an underground humanist rally cry, he learned how to articulate a pacifist vision in a serrated punk snarl. \u201cWe don\u2019t want no violence, we don\u2019t need no wars,\u201d H.R. sings on \u201cRock for Light,\u201d the band\u2019s brightest flash of utopianism. \u201cWe just want what\u2019s right: Rock for light.\u201d\n    In a combined-frame image, Bad Brains performs at the Rock Hotel in Manhattan in July 1985. From left, Dr. Know (Gary Miller), H.R. (Paul Hudson), Earl Hudson and Darryl Jenifer. (Photo illustration by Steven Hanner)  \n It\u2019s strange how we use the word \u201ctimeless\u201d to praise the music we feel most loyal to \u2014 especially since music is a temporal art that relies on time in order for it to be experienced. And while it might be tempting to think of recorded sound as a replayable swatch of frozen time, scientifically, only light experiences true timelessness. Einstein taught us that time and space are relative: The closer you get to traveling through space at the speed of light, the slower time will move \u2014 and at light speed, time stops. The mathematical physicist Roger Penrose had a nice way of putting it: \u201cEternity is no big deal to a photon.\u201d\n    The front cover of Bad Brains' \"Rock For Light\" album. (Bad Brains)  \n Try keeping these ideas in your head space when listening to \u201cRock For Light,\u201d an album in which producer Ric Ocasek helped push Bad Brains even closer to light speed by speeding up the tapes while remixing the album with Jenifer in 1991. The forthcoming \u201cRock for Light\u201d reissue restores the performances to their original speed (slower) and pitch (lower). It sounds infinitely better. (Maybe we can forgive a guy who named his band the Cars for wanting to make a fast thing go faster.)\n And at life speed, the band\u2019s ideas hit harder, especially the title track\u2019s cosmic refrain: Rock for light, rock for light, rock for light. In this moment, and in so many others, Bad Brains invite us to yearn with them, to move with them, to sprint alongside them as they accelerate into a realm of pure energy and total freedom where this music might live forever and eternity is no big deal.",

    "body": "Hours later, McConnell called the legislation \"a solution in search of a problem\" and promised that Republicans \"will not be supporting it,\" dooming its chances unless the Senate changes its rules. That didn't deter Democrats' key centrist. \"I work with everybody, I want to find out where they are at, what we can do, I'm working on the voting thing very hard and I'm out there talking to every Republican I can,\u201d Manchin told reporters after the meeting. \u201cI was seeing if there was a pathway forward.\u201d Still, the West Virginian's entreaties to the GOP are unlikely to convince the necessary 10 Senate Republicans to sign onto the bill. The legislation so far has zero Republican cosponsors. \u201cThis is not something that the federal government has been historically involved in for good reason,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Every state conducts elections differently.\u201d The latest legislation, led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), would establish some federally mandated voting rules, such as requiring early voting options and expanding access to mail ballots, but is more scaled back than an original version that would have broadly remade the election process. The new bill could come to the Senate floor as early as next week. Klobuchar in a statement Tuesday said that the legislation will \u201cset basic national standards to make sure all Americans can cast their ballots in the way that works best for them, regardless of what zip code they live in.\u201d The latest package is meant to serve as a substitute for a sweeping piece of legislation that included a slew of ethics and campaign finance provisions that would have completely remade how candidates and officeholders can raise and spend money, along with the much-discussed election provisions. The House and Senate designated the original bill H.R. 1 and S. 1, respectively, to mark its importance to Democratic leadership. The new version of the ethics and elections reform bill includes standards for states that require voter identification. But that provision isn't as strict as Manchin's original proposal, which called for a nationwide ID requirement. Instead, the new proposed legislation lays out guideposts for states to follow if they were to institute voter ID. In addition, lawmakers added a provision that's intended to protect the certification of election results and independence of local officials. The legislation would also establish grants for states that would go toward election administration and would allow for states to opt in to public financing for House races, a scaled down version of the nationwide program originally in H.R. 1. The compromise bill keeps a provision from the original version that would require a much larger swath of politically active groups to disclose their donors and adds more transparency requirements for online advertising, which have generally trailed TV ads. The new bill also scraps a plan from H.R. 1 that would have required states to establish independent commissions for congressional redistricting. It would, however, ban partisan gerrymandering. Democrats argue the legislation is necessary to combat laws in Republican-led states like Texas and Georgia that have added voting restrictions. With Republicans largely opposed to the bill, final passage is impossible without changes to the upper chamber's rules. Senate Republicans used the filibuster to block H.R. 1, which previously passed the House in March, and argued the legislation amounts to a federal takeover of elections. Manchin meanwhile, had previously called the legislation too broad. The latest election and ethics reform bill is the result of months of negotiation between Klobuchar, Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as Democratic caucus members Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Angus King of Maine, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Alex Padilla of California and Jon Tester of Montana. But without the support of 10 Senate Republicans, Klobuchar's legislation will almost certainly face the same fate as the original package: a filibuster. Civil rights leaders have long warned that Senate Democrats must make a choice between protecting voting rights and the filibuster, and they have urged the caucus to at least carve out an exception to the rules for voting rights legislation. \u201cI always think we can get at least 10,\u201d Manchin said Tuesday, citing the success of the bipartisan infrastructure deal. \u201cI think it's very important, I'm working as hard as I can.\u201d Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have repeatedly said they have no interest in scrapping the filibuster, even if it's just for voting rights legislation, and Manchin said the topic didn't come up in his meeting with McConnell. Some advocates for H.R. 1 have privately hoped that the impending filibuster of the election and ethics reform package will highlight Republicans stonewalling the legislation and get Manchin and others to reconsider their stance on Senate rules. Schumer has not tipped his hand on rules changes. But the New York Democrat has vowed that \u201cfailure is not an option.\u201d \"Let me be clear, Republicans refusing to support anything on voting rights is not an excuse for Democrats to do nothing,\" Schumer said Tuesday. \"The Senate must act.\"",

    "body": "For our country to succeed economically, our market-based system must function alongside strong, effective government. Strong, effective government, in turn, requires a functioning democratic process. By repairing our democracy, H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 could pave the way for policies that achieve the interdependent objectives of strong growth, widespread economic well-being and reduced inequality.\n\nThese bills are so important that if they can garner majority support, Senate rules should be changed so that they can be passed even without 60 votes.\n\nFaith in democracy and faith in markets go hand in hand. People support pro-growth policies when they believe they will share in the benefits of growth. For these benefits to be widely shared, we need an inclusive growth policy agenda. This can be achieved only if elected officials feel accountable to the broader public. And there is broad accountability only if voting is widespread.\n\nH.R. 1 expands the ease and accessibility of voting. Under the bill, Americans would automatically be registered to vote when they apply for state services. States would also be required to allow voters to register online. The legislation would implement universal voting by mail; provide at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections in every state; and, wherever possible, make polling places located adjacent to public transportation.\n\nThe bills also include new campaign finance measures, such as improved disclosures and small-dollar matching, that would give voice to lower- and middle-income people and help ensure that income inequality does not translate as readily into political inequality, and vice versa.\n\nThis legislation could also serve as a balm for our increasingly polarized politics. H.R. 1 bans partisan gerrymandering and requires the use of independent commissions to draw congressional districts. Mapping rules would be made consistent throughout the country, and the public would have a chance to review the maps and comment before they are finalized. Districts that heavily favor one party could become competitive again, and each side would be incentivized to win a broad majority of voters \u2014 not simply a vocal sliver of primary voters.\n\nWhen elected officials believe it\u2019s in their self-interest to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, they are more likely to ground decisions in facts and analysis and to engage in principled compromise. They are also more resistant to the pull of populism and nationalism.\n\nH.R. 1 and H.R. 4 would be worthy priorities under any circumstances. But we are not facing any circumstances. The current political moment makes protecting the democratic process not merely important but absolutely crucial.\n\nThese vote-restricting laws could render the political process unable to correct itself. That means our choice isn\u2019t between reforming our democracy now or reforming it later: It\u2019s between reforming our democracy now and not being able to reform our democracy because it\u2019s too late.\n\nIdeally, H.R. 1, which the House of Representatives passed this month, and H.R. 4, a version of which the House passed in 2019, would pass with wide bipartisan majorities after a traditional Senate debate. But if the bills don\u2019t garner 60 votes, yet a majority is ready to pass these bills into law, the Senate should declare that H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 are so important that the 60-vote threshold for breaking a filibuster and ending debate should no longer apply to them, regardless of where senators stand on the broader question of eliminating or reforming the filibuster altogether.\n\nIn business, government and life, bad processes inevitably lead to bad outcomes. The process by which our leaders are elected is broken and growing worse. Repairing that electoral process \u2014 if necessary, by bypassing the legislative filibuster \u2014 isn\u2019t just about abstract ideas of fairness and equality. It\u2019s also an essential act to advance policies that improve Americans\u2019 well-being, thereby strengthening the foundation of both our democracy and our market economy.",

That 800-page travesty was doomed once West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin came out against it. But now Democrats are rallying around Plan B, which is based on a three-page memo circulated by Mr. Manchin\u2019s office.\n\nIt\u2019s a curious document. The preamble insists that any voting bill \u201cmust be the result of both Democrats and Republicans coming together.\u201d But then it suggests an H.R.1 \u201ccompromise\u201d that is no bipartisan kumbaya. As Republican leader Mitch McConnell said last week in ruling out Mr. Manchin\u2019s wish list, it still involves \u201can assault on the fundamental idea that states, not the federal government, should decide how to run their own elections.\u201d\n\nTo start, Mr. Manchin\u2019s memo suggests mandating \u201cat least 15 consecutive days of early voting.\u201d Yet one prominent Democratic opponent of H.R.1., New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, has objected that his state\u2019s constitution dates to 1783, and it \u201crequires that a voter must be present\u201d on Election Day unless \u201cabsent from the town or city, or physically disabled.\u201d Yet New Hampshire, he added, has had \u201cthe third highest voter turnout in the country for each of the last four presidential elections.\u201d\n\nThe Manchin memo proposes that Congress \u201cban partisan gerrymandering and use computer models.\u201d It\u2019s not clear precisely what Mr. Manchin has in mind, but skeptics will rightly see this as a plan to turn an overtly political process into a covertly political one that would be controlled by unaccountable technocrats.\n\nMr. Manchin wants to amp up campaign-finance rules by passing the Honest Ads Act. That proposal, per H.R.1, would require internet platforms to post a public list, with names and addresses, of anyone who spent more than $500 a year on \u201cqualified political advertisements,\u201d including messages \u201crelating to any political matter of national importance.\u201d Mr. Manchin would throw in the Disclose Act, putting new reporting rules on businesses and nonprofits whose \u201cpublic communication\u201d so much as \u201cpromotes\u201d or \u201cattacks\u201d a candidate. The left wants to identify and then stigmatize donors to conservative causes.",

    "body": "Humu, an HR tech startup cofounded by former Google head of HR Laszlo Bock, announced a $60 million Series C funding round. \n \n  Photo: Justin Winokur via Humu \n  \n\nLaszlo Bock still remembers his first day at Google back in 2006, when the management team sat down to review candidates who were up for a job.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe rejected somebody because one of my colleagues said they had a \u2018stupid major,\u2019 \u201d Bock recalls, who led human resources, or \u201cpeople operations\u201d as Google called it, from 2006 to 2016. \u201cAnd this was somebody, by the way, who was at Stanford with great grades. I was just appalled at the bias.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThat distrust of gut-based talent decisions helped inspire Bock to launch Humu with former Google colleagues Wayne Crosby and Jessie Wisdom in 2017. Bock is CEO of the company, which uses AI technology and the \u201cnudge\u201d theory introduced by economist Richard Thaler and Harvard Law professor Cass Sunstein to help organizations keep employees engaged and effective in their jobs. On Tuesday, Humu announced a $60 million Series C round led by the venture capital firm TCV, bringing its total funding to $110 million.\u00a0\n\n\nHumu\u2019s raise may not be eye-popping in an HR tech sector that attracted $12.3 billion in venture capital deals last year, according to PitchBook, but the investment\u2014and Humu\u2019s model\u2014speaks to the growing need for technology that helps with what a recent KPMG report described as \u201cdifficulties associated with managing remote or hybrid workforces.\u201d\n\nAs TCV partner David Eichler says, \u201cpeople are realizing the cost of maintaining and managing your employee force is non-trivial and really critical.\u201d \n\nHumu works something like a virtual personal coach, using artificial intelligence to mine employee surveys and other data inputs to identify which behavioral changes could help workers and employers reach their goals. It then sends workers tailored \u201cnudges\u201d which appear in email, Slack or Microsoft Teams and are aimed at changing behaviors, often with explanations or links to research about why these matter. As people say they\u2019ve improved\u2014and the people around them do, too\u2014machine learning helps the system move on to additional goals.\n\n\n\u201cThe thing that got me, as a CHRO, is that [Humu\u2019s customers said] they saw behavioral change. Every single customer cited that,\u201d says Jessica Neal, a former talent chief at Netflix who is now a TCV venture partner and will join Humu\u2019s board. Many platforms offer record-keeping or worker surveys, she says, but \u201cthe one thing that you don\u2019t have in your suite is a platform to help you figure out what to do.\u201d \n\n\nHumu\u2019s \u201cnudges\u201d send reminders for things like giving co-workers credit in meetings, checking in on other teams\u2019 project deadlines or getting quiet teammates to speak up. Nudging multiple people on similar issues helps drive change, Bock says: A manager might get a reminder before a meeting to urge quiet workers to say something; at the same time, coworkers get suggestions to seek colleagues\u2019 input. \n\nBock says Humu won\u2019t disclose revenues or an overall valuation. But he says the company works with two of the top three companies in several major industries, which include pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, technology and chemicals. Its client list has grown by about six times in the last two years, he says, and includes Virgin Atlantic, Vodafone and Fidelity Investments.\u00a0\n\nThe new capital raise will be used, Bock says, to adapt Humu's platform to work better for \u201cdeskless\u201d employees, such as front-line retail workers and delivery drivers. The company will also invest in creating more tools for managers, such as automating meeting invites and other routine tasks, allowing more control over which nudges are sent and notifying them when teams have low morale.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with a lot of H.R. issues and people challenges inside companies is every single person has their own intuition about what the right answer is,\u201d says Bock. \u201cUnless you actually run the experiments and work in the field, whose opinion is more valid than anyone else\u2019s?\u201d\n\n \n \u201cThe challenge with a lot of H.R. issues and people challenges inside companies is every single person has their own intuition.\u201d \n \n  \n\nThat Bock finds himself an H.R. tech entrepreneur amid boom times for the sector is fitting for someone who\u2019s had a knack for working at companies that have shaped the business world\u2019s approach to talent management in recent decades. Bock worked as a consultant at McKinsey during the late dot-com boom; in the mid-2000s, he worked in H.R. at General Electric when it was still considered a leadership \u201cacademy\u201d vaunted for its management succession machine.\u00a0\n\nThen Google came calling, and he helped scale it from post-IPO tech darling to industry colossus over the next decade, building a culture fueled by free lunches and onsite dry cleaning that other companies tried to mimic. He\u2019s also known in H.R. circles for building Google\u2019s PhD-stocked \u201cpeople analytics\u201d team and chronicling their work in a 2015 bestseller.\n\nBut the road to that pedigree wasn\u2019t a straight one, or one Bock thinks should open doors. For Bock, whose parents fled communist Romania when he was two, his first post-college years included an acting stint (he briefly appeared as a lifeguard on \u201cBaywatch\u201d) and working for a construction materials manufacturer, where a mentor taught him how to tie dress shoes for the first time. At Yale, a McKinsey consultant said his resume wasn't \u201cdistinctive enough,\u201d though he later got a job.\u00a0\n\nBock interviewed with nearly 20 people at Google and initially declined the job he was up for; he only got the top role after writing a three-page memo to Google\u2019s founders about the post-IPO issues he thought they would face.\u00a0\n\n\nFew former big company CHROs lead tech startups\u2014H.R. experts point to former Goldman Sachs H.R. chief Dane Holmes, who cofounded DEI platform Eskalera, as another. Bock sometimes talks like one, too, saying a consumer version is on Humu\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d over time: \u201cEventually what we want to do is not just make work better for people today, but really transform people's careers and lives over time.\u201d\n\nSome who know Bock say such lofty talk is genuine. Steve Patscot, who leads the H.R. practice at executive search firm Spencer Stuart and worked at GE the same time as Bock, says he would sometimes call Bock for a candidate reference. \u201cHe said something to me I\u2019ll never forget. \u2018I am always happy to give you a reference on anybody who I\u2019ve ever worked with, I just need you to do me a favor,\u2019 \u201d Patscot recalls Bock saying. \u201c \u2018I believe I hired great people, and I just need you to make sure the job you\u2019re putting them in really matters.\u2019 \u201d\n\nStill, some analysts say Humu faces an increasingly crowded competitive landscape, with tech giants like Microsoft and Workday moving into the space. Helen Poitevin, an analyst at Gartner, says she\u2019s struggled to be able to speak with customers who are using Humu\u2019s product, and that there\u2019s a lot of \u201cbuzz\u201d about AI and nudges that she doesn\u2019t yet see leading to customer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, an obstacle for any company trying to use AI to coach employees, says Forrester analyst Betsy Summers, is how much data clients are able or willing to put into their systems to make such software more valuable. She says Humu has a \u201ccool value proposition,\u201d but cited a survey where H.R. leaders said they have less confidence in their own internal AI capabilities than anything else.\n\n\nBock and Crosby, one of Humu\u2019s cofounders, say the company does more than just survey employees of its mostly large enterprise customers about engagement, and that its customized, science-backed nudges are different from off-the-shelf notifications. \u201cWhat we really are is a behavioral change platform,\u201d Crosby says.\n\nExpedia Group chief people officer Arch Singh wrote in an email to Forbes that the travel company has used Humu since 2020, \u201ca time when\u00a0everyone was adjusting to\u00a0remote work\u00a0and coping with uncertainty.\u201d It\u2019s used Humu to gather feedback on employees\u2019 experience during the pandemic and send tailored nudges a couple times per month, saying it has seen higher retention rates among those who use it.\u00a0\n\nFor Bock, the pandemic has reinforced how much employers must treat their people better. And even if there\u2019s some irony in managers needing tech to remember something like a work anniversary, \u201cwe as human beings have a really hard time doing that because we're fallible and flawed,\u201d Bock says. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a moment for the right kind of humane technology to transform that, to just give us that little bit of help so we know how to make time and space for other people.\u201d",

    "body": "House Democrats\u2019 push to tack a sweeping drug price negotiation bill to President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure package was always going to face a fight in the evenly divided Senate. But the legislation is also hitting troubled waters in the House.Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., listens during a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on unsustainable drug prices on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020, in Washington.At least 10 caucus moderates are signaling opposition to Democrats\u2019 drug pricing negotiation bill \u2014 more than enough to potentially force House Speaker Nancy Pelosi into dropping the reforms from infrastructure legislation Democrats hope to pass along party lines. Pelosi can only spare two Democratic defections on partisan legislation because of the party\u2019s slim House majority.In a letter to Pelosi earlier this month, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, the group of moderate House Democrats called for a more modest drug pricing overhaul that\u2019s bipartisan and would \u201cpreserve our invaluable innovation ecosystem.\u201dEarly resistance to the drug pricing bill, H.R. 3 (117), indicates that drugmakers may escape what they consider a worst-case scenario, in which Democrats extract huge savings from their industry to bankroll a broad range of party priorities in infrastructure legislation. Though the drug negotiation measure faces long odds in the Senate, House leadership hopes that passing H.R. 3 would give Democrats leverage to keep pressure on drugmakers when the Senate takes up infrastructure legislation.President Joe Biden sought to keep drug pricing separate from his infrastructure proposals totaling roughly $4 trillion, though he endorsed price negotiations in his joint address to Congress late last month. House leaders have said they\u2019re committed to moving forward on H.R. 3, citing polls showing strong bipartisan support for empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices. House Democratic leaders still see the infrastructure package as their best chance of passing major drug reforms, despite concerns raised by the moderate members, a senior aide said.\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for members to express hopes for bipartisanship,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIt\u2019s a value we all share.\u201dHouse Democrats in the previous Congress, when they enjoyed a larger majority, passed H.R. 3 almost entirely along party lines. The legislation went nowhere in the Senate, which was then controlled by Republicans, and former President Donald Trump opposed the bill. But many Democrats campaigned on the bill last cycle, showcasing it as an example of what the party could achieve if it won full control of Washington.Eight of the 10 Democratic moderates now raising concerns over H.R. 3 voted for the bill in the previous Congress. Rep. Scott Peters of California, who hails from a biotech-heavy district in San Diego and led the letter to Pelosi, said he cast that vote knowing it had no chance of becoming law at the time. He said he supported it only to \u201cstart a conversation about lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\u201dVideo: Senate set to take up voting rights bill (ABC News)Now, he and other moderates are pushing more incremental alternatives that have garnered some Republican support, like capping Medicare enrollees\u2019 out-of-pocket drug costs \u2014 a policy included in Democrats\u2019 broader negotiation bill.\u201cIt\u2019s a better problem to have a cure or therapy that's expensive and have to figure out how to get it to people than it is to not have the cure at all, and I\u2019m afraid that's what this version of H.R. 3 would leave us with,\u201d he said.Even the staunchest supporters of H.R. 3 have acknowledged Democrats \u2014 particularly those facing tough reelection fights in swing districts \u2014 will face enormous pressure from the powerful drug lobby to oppose the bill.\u201cThere are some Democrats who will be nervous about this, but I think we can get them to support it, because it\u2019s so meaningful for the people we all represent,\u201d said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who led a recent letter urging Biden to endorse government drug negotiations.Several of the moderate Democrats expressing reservations about the drug pricing bill are the targets of a $4 million-plus campaign by the conservative American Action Network opposing the legislation. The group plans to air ads in the districts of more than 40 Democrats, slamming H.R. 3 as \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s socialist prescription drug takeover plan\u201d and warning it would \u201ccancel new cures for the patients who need them and send American innovation overseas.\u201dHealth care industry analysts say Democrats\u2019 push for H.R. 3 is likely to fizzle out under intense industry opposition and hurdles in the 50-50 Senate, where some Democratic moderates have also expressed concerns about the negotiation bill.\u201cSo, what gets done?\u201d said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director of the research firm Capitol Street. \u201cPerhaps minimal policy, at best, this year, and more down the road.\u201dA narrower, bipartisan bill from Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is seen as the \u201cmost likely outcome,\u201d according to a recent memo from the Cowen Washington Research Group. The bill would cap seniors\u2019 drug costs and penalize drugmakers for raising prices too fast \u2014 a provision that many Republicans have likened to price controls. It would save the government a projected $95 billion over a decade, far less than the $450 billion-plus under the House negotiation bill.Others like Meena Datta, the global co-leader of Sidley Austin\u2019s health care practice, questioned whether Democrats were even likely to opt for smaller-scale measures, like new requirements for drugmakers to justify price increases.But many progressive and moderate lawmakers alike warn that Democrats risk losing voters in the 2022 midterms if they fail to deliver meaningful reforms that take on the drug industry.Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is among the most vocal advocates of H.R. 3, said he\u2019s confident this political pressure will sway even the most hesitant Democrats.\u201cThere is no state in this country \u2014 none where people don\u2019t understand that the pharmaceutical industry is ripping them off,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNo one can defend that we pay 10 times more than people in other countries. I think every one of my colleagues knows that, and I expect they will vote the right way.\u201d",

    "body": "In an impassioned speech just after a school shooting in Texas left at least 19 children and two adults dead on Tuesday, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr criticized the U.S. Senate for failing to vote on background check legislation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 50 senators, right now, who refuse to vote on H.R. 8, which is a background check rule that the House passed,\u201d Kerr said ahead of his team\u2019s playoff game versus the Dallas Mavericks in remarks that went viral. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they won\u2019t vote on it: to hold on to power.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I ask you, [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell, I ask all of you senators who refuse to do anything about the violence and school shootings and supermarket shootings \u2026 I ask you, are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and our churchgoers?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen are we going to do something?\u201d Kerr added. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there. \u2026 I\u2019m tired of the moments of silence. Enough!\u201d\n\nKerr, a longtime gun safety advocate whose father was assassinated in a shooting outside his office in Beirut in 1984, referenced a bill known as the Bipartisan Background Checks Act that would expand federal background checks required for gun purchases.\n\nCurrently, federal law does not require that unlicensed gun sellers operating online or at gun shows conduct background checks prior to the purchase of arms.\n\nH.R. 8, which passed the House in March 2021, would close loopholes in gun purchases, requiring a background check for all gun sales.\n\nTwenty-two percent of Americans reported that they purchased their most recent gun without any background check, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nBackground checks have effectively blocked 4 million sales \u201cto people prohibited by law from having guns,\u201d the group said.\n\nStill, H.R. 8 and another proposal to strengthen background checks have stalled for over a year in the Senate, where 10 Republican votes are required to overcome a filibuster.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has begun the process of getting those bills on the upper chamber\u2019s calendar.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), however, has said H.R. 8 is too far-reaching.\u00a0Manchin has instead pushed to vote on a narrower plan that exempts transfers and sales between family and friends, a proposal he negotiated with input from the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishingly frustrating,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said of the process. \u201cThese are things that most gun owners want and yet this rabid goddamned NRA won\u2019t let the Republicans move.\u201d",

    "body": "Placeholder while article actions load\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr had a hard time thinking about basketball after at least 19 children and two teachers were killed in a mass shooting Tuesday at an elementary school in Texas. Outraged, he used this platform to plead with Senate Republicans to move forward on a years-long legislative effort that would require background checks on all gun sales: H.R. 8.\n\n\nThe bill, also known as the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, was championed by Democrats after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting that left 26 dead nearly a decade ago and passed by the House in 2021. But it has since languished in the Senate for more than a year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 50 senators, right now, who refuse to vote on H.R. 8,\u201d Kerr said. Kerr \u2014 a longtime gun-control advocate whose father was shot to death in 1984 \u2014 had biting words for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his Republican colleagues: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they won\u2019t vote on it: to hold on to power.\u201d\n\nGolden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr spoke about the Texas elementary school shooting from Dallas on May 24, calling on senators to take action. (Video: NBA)\n\n\n\nNow calls are mounting for H.R. 8\u2032s passage amid public outrage over the deadliest mass shooting at an American school in nearly a decade. But legal and firearms experts are not optimistic the bill will become law, even after the tragedy in Uvalde, Tex.\n\n\u201cWhen similar legislation failed after Sandy Hook, despite sky-high popular support among the public, I think it left a lot of advocates pessimistic,\u201d Jake Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University School of Law, told The Washington Post. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean this time won\u2019t be different, but I suspect that\u2019s the concern.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to the uphill battle ahead, Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday that the chamber would not quickly vote on either H.R. 8 or H.R. 1446, which would close what\u2019s known as the \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d that allows some licensed gun sales to be completed before a background check is finished. While delaying a vote could give Democrats and Republicans more time to hash out a possible deal, Schumer expressed skepticism that the Senate would get the votes needed to pass the bill into law.\n\n\u201cMy Republican colleagues can work with us now,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI know this is a slim prospect, very slim, all too slim \u2014 we\u2019ve been burned so many times before \u2014 but this is so important.\u201d\n\nH.R. 8 would close a loophole that does not require background checks in transactions involving unlicensed and private sellers, such as purchases online or at gun shows. The bill is considered to be among the first major new firearm restrictions to advance in Congress in a generation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bill that we have to pass. It\u2019s not an option to give up,\u201d Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), a longtime supporter of the legislation sponsoring the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 in the House, told The Post on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 19 more reasons yesterday why it\u2019s not an option to give up.\u201d\n\nIn the Uvalde shooting\u2019s aftermath, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deflected criticism that the state\u2019s lax gun laws put students at risk. At a news conference Wednesday, Abbott downplayed the shooter\u2019s relatively easy access to firearms, pointing out that residents 18 and older have been legally allowed to buy long guns \u2014 a category that includes the style of gun used in the Uvalde shooting \u2014 for more than 60 years. The governor also speculated that the alleged shooter, who authorities say legally purchased a pair of semiautomatic rifles recently, probably suffered from mental illness \u2014 although he said authorities found no mental health record.\n\nThompson said the outline of H.R. 8 was first sketched in the days after the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn. After Congress proposed a bipartisan bill in 2013 that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers and banned assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines, more than 50 senators, including some Republicans, signaled their support and gave observers hope that the measure could pass.\n\nWhen it failed to get the necessary votes to pass, President Barack Obama lashed out at gun-rights groups and senators who voted against the bill, saying its defeat in the spring of 2013 amounted to \u201ca pretty shameful day for Washington.\u201d\n\nProposals on background checks did not pass the House chamber again until Democrats regained control years later. In 2019, the House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which called for expanding federal background checks for gun purchases and transfer, by a vote of 240 to 190, with mostly Democrats and eight Republicans.\n\nYet the 2019 bill died in committee in the Senate, with Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), then the majority whip, noting at the time it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that a House gun bill would get Senate consideration as long as Republicans were in control of the chamber. President Donald Trump made a veto threat if it did somehow get passed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt went to the Senate where it languished,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThere was renewed optimism last year when Democrats regained slim control of the Senate to go along with their majority in the House. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 passed the House last year by a vote of 227 to 203 \u2014 another largely Democrat-heavy vote with the support of eight Republicans. But this version of the background-check bill has again gone without a vote, as it remains unlikely to pass.\n\nIf a vote were held today, Thompson said, \u201cI\u2019m assuming we\u2019d have 50 votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is you don\u2019t have 10 Republican senators courageous enough to allow the bill to come up for the vote,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s sponsor of the bill, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), expressed his anger on Tuesday and pleaded with his colleagues to find a way to put politics aside and work together to stop the carnage of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Murphy said, his voice raised. \u201cWhy are we here if not to try and make sure fewer schools and few communities go through what Sandy Hook has gone through, what Uvalde is going through. \u2026 I am here on this floor to beg, to literally get down on my hands and knees and beg my colleagues: Find a path forward here. Work with us to find a way to pass laws that make this less likely.\u201d\n\nIn response to a gunman killing multiple students in Uvalde, Tex., on May 24, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called on his colleagues to pass gun legislation. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nSo far, Republicans have not given any indication whether they will engage in a potential compromise on H.R. 8. McConnell called the Texas shooting the work of a \u201cderanged young man\u201d and asked for prayers on Wednesday but did not mention any possible legislative action. GOP senators like Thune suggested that a potential Republican response could be centered \u201caround the issue of mental health,\u201d while Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), said they hoped lawmakers would look at legislation to improve school security.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said it would be wise for states to adopt red-flag laws \u2014 which would enable law enforcement, if given a court order, to seize guns from someone considered a danger to themselves or others. Romney also suggested he supported background checks.\n\n\u201cBackground checks and updating our background check technology is something that I think is an appropriate federal responsibility,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSchumer is urging Americans who want H.R. 8 to pass to vote gun control-resistant legislators out of office. But Eugene Volokh, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and an expert on constitutional law and gun-control laws, argued that voters and legislators might not think a background-check law would do much to help curb school shootings.\n\n\u201cI think most voters would say this background-check bill is not really connected to mass shootings, other than being connecting to the general subject of guns,\u201d Volokh said. \u201cWhile you can never say never on a compromise, there isn\u2019t a real appetite on the left or the right to make compromise.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Thompson said he\u2019s grateful to see public figures outside politics turning attention to the issue. In addition to Kerr, another member of the Warriors \u2014 Damion Lee \u2014 told reporters that it\u2019s currently \u201ceasier to get a gun than baby formula.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious. I\u2019m heartbroken. I\u2019m saddened. I\u2019m frustrated,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis is not rocket science.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis, Colby Itkowitz, Marianna Sotomayor, David Nakamura and Karin Brulliard contributed to this report.",

    "body": "by the industry and arguing the proposals would \"sacrifice future medical advances.\" The moves are part of an aggressive campaign against the measures to lower drug prices backed by congressional Democrats, which threaten to take a large chunk of money out of the pharmaceutical industry. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that House Democrats' leading bill, known as H.R. 3, would save the government almost $500 billion over 10 years on prescription drugs, and lower prices by about 50 percent on drugs whose prices would become eligible for negotiation by the secretary of Health and Human Services. The push from PhRMA, long known as a powerful force in Washington, comes as congressional Democrats are pressing forward with legislation to lower drug prices as part of their $3.5 trillion reconciliation package. The details of the final legislation remain unclear, though, particularly after three moderate House Democrats, Reps. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), and Scott Peters (D-Calif.), said Tuesday they would vote against H.R. 3 in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, saying they instead wanted a more scaled-back measure. Advocates have accused the three lawmakers of being beholden to the pharmaceutical industry. \"Big Pharma will spend, do, and say whatever it takes to defeat any legislation that will curb its unilateral power to dictate prices of prescription drugs,\" David Mitchell, founder of the group Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, said on Tuesday. In its ad, PhRMA states that the new drug pricing measure would mean politicians would be deciding what \"medicines you can and can't get.\" \"Politicians say they want to negotiate medicine prices in Medicare,\" the new ad states. \"But make no mistake: What politicians mean is they'll decide which medicines you can and can't get.\" Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, pushed back on that claim, noting that the legislation in Congress would not allow the government to decide not to cover certain drugs. \"The bill working its way through Congress focuses on drug prices,\" Neuman wrote in an email. \"There's really nothing in the proposal that would allow the government to decide which medications people on Medicare can get.\" Allowing the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices, the center of Democrats' measures, is extremely popular with voters in polls. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll earlier this year found almost 90 percent of the public favors the idea. PhRMA points out that the same poll found that when people were told that the proposals \"could lead to less research and development of new drugs,\" support dropped to just 32 percent. When H.R. 3 passed the House in 2019, the CBO estimated it would result in eight fewer drugs being introduced over a 10 year period, out of about 300 drugs expected to be introduced in total over that time. Ken Frazier, executive chairman of Merck, told reporters that under H.R. 3, \" we will lose that substantial funding for R&D, which means we will forego many important discoveries that will have an impact not just on the economy, not just on this industry, but on the many people who are waiting for those cures and treatments to come forward.\"",

Joe Manchin \u201cdoesn\u2019t support\u201d the gun control legislation recently passed by the House of Representatives.\n Caldwell explained Manchin\u2019s position while responding to a question from guest host Kasie Hunt about moderate Democrats\u2019 stance on gun control legislation. Monday\u2019s shooting in Boulder, Colorado, has reignited the debate over gun control. (RELATED: Rep. Hudson Calls Out Misleading Gun Control Bills)\n      \u201cWhere do you think these two people, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, stand, and what are the dynamics on the Hill around this as we sit here covering yet another mass shooting?\u201d Hunt asked Caldwell.\n Caldwell responded by noting that the H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, which passed the House on March 11, have not yet been brought to the Senate. \u201cSenator Manchin just told reporters in the past 30 minutes that he doesn\u2019t support the House bills,\u201d she added, before noting the challenge of getting Senate Democrats to support and pass legislation. She did not mention Democratic Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in her response.\n Caldwell said Manchin worked with Republican Pennsylvania Sen.

It\u2019s an exercise in getting people on the record,\u201d she concluded.\n On Tuesday, President Joe Biden called on Congress to pass H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, in addition to the banning of \u201cassault weapons\u201d and high-capacity magazines.\n \n If signed into law, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 would mandate universal background checks on all gun purchases and would extend the length of time that a background check can be completed, among other things. The bills will need to reach the 60 vote filibuster-proof threshold in the Senate in order to pass. With the current Senate at a 50-50 split, 10 Republicans would need to join all Democrats to pass the bills. Without Manchin, that number becomes 11.",

Vance reacts on 'Fox  Friends.'\n\n\n\n\nIf you listened solely to Democratic talking points, including the so-called mainstream media, you would be convinced that America is a systemically racist nation and that Republicans are somehow hell bent on disenfranchising large swaths of voters. Both of these notions are patently false.\nIn fact, thanks to sustained long-term efforts, in 2021 it is easier to register and vote now than at any point in American history \u2013\u00a0no matter what color your skin is. This is a measure progress of which we should all be proud.\u00a0\nWhen the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, voter registration and voter turnout by minorities \u2013\u00a0specifically Black Americans \u2013\u00a0were the measure of whether voter suppression was taking place in a state.\u00a0A moment\u2019s consideration would lead an ordinary American to conclude those are sensible metrics to gauge minority voter suppression.\u00a0\nCHUCK DEVORE: BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS \u2013 TEXAS MAY HAVE TO DEFEND ITSELF. HERE'S WHY\nBut, in spite of these facts, Democrats in Congress have manufactured a myth of widespread voter suppression in order to impose a federal takeover of elections.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe instrument of their proposed federal control over election law was introduced (and never passed) in the last Congress as H.R. 4, the \"John Lewis Voting Rights bill.\"\u00a0The biggest, but not the only, major change is that H.R. 4 would reinstitute the practice of requiring federal preclearance (i.e., federal permission) for any state election change, no matter how minor.\u00a0 \u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nPreclearance was previously struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the Shelby County v. Holder case in 2013. Thus, H.R. 4 is an attempt by the Democrats to go around the court and once again subject state election reforms to a federal veto \u2013\u00a0no matter how trivial any proposed change might be.\u00a0\nUnder H.R. 4, the federal government could veto and block any, and potentially all, state election reforms (plus redistricting) under the guise of fighting discrimination. However, there is no requirement to actually prove that anything a state was proposing would be discriminatory. If a state sought to fight the federal government\u2019s decision, rather than requiring the federal government to prove that a new law would result in discrimination, the burden of proof would fall on the states.\u00a0\u00a0\nThink about that for a moment. The accused state has to prove its own innocence.\u00a0\nTo use the analogy of criminal law, that would mean that all the federal government would have to do is accuse a defendant of committing a crime, and at that point it would be up to the defendant to prove himself innocent or go to jail!\u00a0\nStates would thus be guilty until they could prove themselves innocent \u2013\u00a0an extraordinary reversal of over 200 years of American law.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe proposed metrics that would be used to decide which states would be subject to the preclearance process with the federal government are designed to result in covering the entire country.\u00a0The reason for the original Voting Rights Act was primarily to fix racist exclusionary laws in the South.\u00a0So the implications of the currently proposed bill are that, not only is the South still somehow blocking minorities from participating in elections, but that the rest of the country has become so oppressive of the voting rights of minorities that every single state needs to be regulated by the federal government too.\u00a0\nThe purpose of H.R. 4 is not to protect voting rights, it is to stop voting reforms going on in the states that are making our elections more transparent, secure and accountable.\u00a0\nThose underlying assumptions simply defy the reality of America in the last 50-plus years.\u00a0\nOnly two states have both higher voter registration among Black voters than White voters and had higher voter turnout of Black voters than White voters in 2020. Guess which two states?\u00a0\nMississippi and Tennessee.\u00a0\nThe worst state in America?\u00a0Massachusetts.\u00a0\nThe purpose of H.R. 4 is not to protect voting rights, it is to stop voting reforms going on in the states that are making our elections more transparent, secure and accountable.\u00a0\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act in force today gives the federal government the power to stop discriminatory voting practices.\u00a0And Section 3 provides for subjecting local or state governments that engage in discriminatory practices to be subject to preclearance.\u00a0These provisions are in force right now, and we are all grateful for the protection against actual discrimination.\u00a0\nDemocrats and their allies in the media would have you believe that rampant and systemic voter suppression is one of the most crucial issues facing our nation. This assertion is quite simply false. \u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn reality, H.R. 4 is nothing but a power grab by congressional Democrats aimed at taking election powers away from the states.\u00a0The takeover of all election reforms and redistricting by federal bureaucrats with a radical agenda under the guise of voter protection would set America back.\u00a0 \u00a0\nH.R. 4 should be rejected in favor of using the current Voting Rights Act \u2013\u00a0Sections 2 and 3 \u2013\u00a0which have already proven to be effective in fighting true discrimination where and when it has existed.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY KEN CUCCINELLI",

    "body": "Research from Gallup released last year shows that record numbers of Americans support some form of cannabis legalization, as more states pass laws legalizing medical and recreational adult uses of cannabis. This has resulted in both parties represented in Congress taking federal cannabis policy more seriously. \n\n  \n  In the Republican Party, for example, a majority now support legalization (though, of course, there is a fair degree of variation in what voters think that should look like in practice), and these shifting attitudes are now reflected in the halls of Congress, where Republican lawmakers are spearheading a number of bills that have pulled back the curtain on federal prohibition and prompted new discussions of what a federal regulation of cannabis should look like. \n\n  \n  \n  Last fall, Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC-1) introduced H.R. 5977, the States Reform Act, a bill to end federal cannabis prohibition and tax the product. Before the States Reform Act, Representative Greg Steube (R-FL-17) introduced H.R. 430, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, one of now many initiatives to grant veterans medical access to cannabis. And in spring of 2021, the late Representative Don Young (R-AK-At Large) demonstrated what conservative federal cannabis policy could look like with the introduction of H.R. 2830, the GRAM Act, a bill to protect Second Amendment rights of adults in states where cannabis is permitted.\n\n  \n  The list of Republican-led initiatives neither starts nor stops there, however. \n\n  \n  Representative Dave Joyce (R-OH-14), a Republican co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, has been at the forefront of the conservative effort to enact strategic cannabis reform at the federal level. In the 115th Congress, he first introduced the STATES Act with the caucus\u2019 founding co-chair, Representative Earl Blumenauer (D-OR-3). \n\n  \n  In May of 2021, he introduced the first Republican-led bill to end federal cannabis prohibition, H.R. 3105, the Common Sense Cannabis Reform Act. This bill was the first in either chamber or party to recognize the need for federal regulation. It quickly gained bipartisan support, which remains an important underlying theme to Mr. Joyce\u2019s cannabis reform efforts. This is why he is often considered a broker for Republicans on this issue, especially in today\u2019s narrowly divided margins in the House and Senate. \n\n  \n  In December of 2021, he worked across the aisle with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY-14) to introduce H.R. 6129, the HOPE Act, which is aimed at expunging petty and non-violent state and local cannabis convictions. The goal of this bipartisan legislation would be to expand economic opportunities for the individuals and communities who have been affected by those offenses in the past. Notably, the only language that has been signed into law to date allowing federal dollars to support cannabis expungements was secured by Representative Joyce. \n\n  \n  And just this April, he again joined forces with notable progressive Representatives Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY-08) and the newly appointed Republican caucus co-chair Brian Mast (R-FL-18) and introduced the Preparing Regulators Effectively for a Post-Prohibition Adult Use Regulated Environment (the PREPARE) Act. \n\n  \n  This bill would establish an inaugural federal commission to advise on an eventual federal regulatory framework for cannabis. Even as a co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, Mr. Joyce has been vocal regarding a need for federal regulation of cannabis, and has been critical of legislation which does not include it. Despite considerable pushback, Joyce has remained firm in his belief that regulation is critical to not only a safe and prosperous legal environment, but also to building the bipartisan buy-in necessary to end federal prohibition. This position has resonated across the ideological spectrum, as Senate Democrats are expected to roll out a sweeping reform package later this summer with substantial focus on federal regulations. \n\n  \n  \n  Some bipartisan bills on cannabis have already passed both chambers.\n\n  The most notable example is H.R. 1996, the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which has passed the U.S. House of Representatives six times to date, most recently with over 100 Republicans voting in support. Many recall a time when Republican support for SAFE was the exception on cannabis policy, not the rule. Many credit this progress both to Representative Ed Perlmutter\u2019s (D-CO-7) relentless work on the issue, and Mr. Joyce\u2019s advocacy between top House Republicans and industry stakeholders in reframing the bill as necessary for public safety to attract conservatives. This is demonstrative of the type of bipartisanship cannabis requires. Without it, important momentum will fade.\n\n  It will take both Republicans and their Democratic colleagues to finally send cannabis legislation to the President\u2019s desk, and it is apparent Republicans are slowly coming along on the topic, and accepting the market exists. It also demonstrates compromise will be required in all forthcoming cannabis legislation for movement to occur.",

It would require states to automatically register eligible voters, as well as offer same-day registration. It would limit states\u2019 ability to purge registered voters from their rolls and restore former felons\u2019 voting rights. Among dozens of other provisions, it would also require states to offer 15 days of early voting and allow no-excuse absentee balloting. \nKupfer, who is also the Indiana Republican Party Chair,\u00a0alleged that if the bill is passed, it would allow Democrats to force through a \"wholesale takeover of state election laws\" by eroding state voter ID laws and\u00a0requiring\u00a0states to adopt automatic voter registration, among other items.\n\"This legislation is the stuff of\u00a0failed democracies and\u00a0is so far outside the mainstream that so-called moderate Democrats should join Republicans in rejecting this bill,\" Kupfer said. \"If the Democrats get their wish and this bill is enacted, it will limit political expression and make our elections\u00a0less secure.\"\nDEMS' HR 1 WOULD BENEFIT AOC, PELOSI, MEDIA-DOMINANT HOUSE MEMBERS MOST: EXPERTS\nIn the wake of the divisive 2020 election cycle, Democrats argue that H.R. 1 will protect Americans\u2019 right to vote.\nThe bill, which passed the House last month, is viewed by Democrats as a powerful counterweight to voting regulations advancing in Republican-controlled statehouses across the country in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s repeated false claims of a stolen 2020 election. \nThe sweeping voting reform law that passed in Georgia, for example, has received a generous amount of outrage from Democrats \u2013 as well as praise from Trump\u00a0supporters.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPelosi said in a speech last month that H.R. 1\u00a0would provide for \"elections that enable people to participate more fully.\"\n\"Our purpose was to remove obstacles of participation, obstacles of participation for Democrats or Republicans,\" Pelosi said. \"That's what the law requires, that was the right thing to do. Whether it was in registration or getting out the vote, we had to be non-partisan. And that's what this legislation does.\"\nPresident Biden called the bill \"landmark legislation\" as he highlighted its necessity. \n\"The right to vote is sacred and fundamental \u2014 it is the right from which all of our other rights as Americans spring,\" Biden said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe bill will need approval in the Senate, where the two parties are deadlocked 50-50.

    "body": "Arizona joins four other states in seeking protection from any federal legislation that would affect Second Amendment rights.\n\n\n\n\nEarly this month, Democrats pushed through President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion pork-barrel COVID-19 bill with only Democratic support. Then, House Democrats passed H.R. 1, the so-called \"For the People Act,\" in a totally partisan 234 \u2013 193 vote.\nThere is a reason you are seeing all these party-line votes. It is because the Democratic Party is not operating as individuals representing distinct districts of Americans. The Democratic Party is operating as a machine \u2013 a machine designed to drive a single agenda and impose it nationwide.\nIn vote after vote, we are watching Democrats, many of whom represent politically mixed, diverse districts and states, falling in line to vote for whatever House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tell them to \u2013 with no regard for what the people they represent back home want.\nNo Democratic Senator or House member seems to care or question what is in these bills. They are simply doing what they are told.\nHANS VON SPAKOVSKY: HR1/FOR THE PEOPLE ACT IMPERILS FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. HERE ARE THE WORST 8 PARTS\nSoon, the U.S. Senate will vote on H.R. 1. As I have been saying for weeks, it should be called the \"For the Corrupt Politicians Act.\"\nAmong other things, this bill will nationalize federal elections, overriding state election laws across the country. This includes circumventing some state voter ID laws that are intended to protect the integrity of elections. It will also prohibit requiring identification, notarization, or witnesses for absentee ballots in every state.\nThe bill also moves to politicize the Federal Election Commission \u2013 the bipartisan entity that regulates federal campaign funding. Currently, the commission has six members \u2013 three Republicans and three Democrats. In the spirit of the Democrats\u2019 \"For the Corrupt Politicians Act,\" the legislation would change the membership to five, so that whichever party was currently in power could control the body charged with enforcing election law. How is this in the spirit of making elections fair and just?\nIncreasingly, we are going to see Democratic members of the House and the Senate put in the position of having to decide whether to vote for the people they represent or the Harris-Biden-Pelosi-Schumer Democratic Machine.\nIf all this isn\u2019t enough, H.R. 1 will also create a tax-funded revenue stream for federal campaigns, which effectively means that conservative taxpayers in Florida will be paying for the re-election campaigns of radical Democrats in California \u2013 and Democrat taxpayers will be footing the bill for Republicans in red states.\nGOP GROUP DETAILS RECIPE FOR HOUSE TO RETAKE MAJORITY IN 2022\nThese measures are just crazy \u2013 and deeply unpopular with Americans.\nIncreasingly, we are going to see Democratic members of the House and the Senate put in the position of having to decide whether to vote for the people they represent or the Harris-Biden-Pelosi-Schumer Democratic Machine.\nJust consider the decisions Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona will have to make when H.R. 1 comes to the Senate for a vote.\nMCCONNELL, MCCARTHY ACCUSE PELOSI OF TRYING TO 'STEAL,' 'OVERTURN' GOP ELECTION VICTORY IN IOWA\nFirst, according to recent surveys about H.R. 1 by McLaughlin  Associates, only 32 percent of Arizonans are even aware that this federal election takeover bill exists. An overwhelming 66 percent of Arizonans say Congress should not pass federal election laws to override their state\u2019s election laws.\nEven more Arizonans (70 percent) reject the idea that the federal government should override Arizona\u2019s voter ID laws. While H.R. 1 does not universally abolish voter ID laws, it opens the door to doing so. According to the survey, 69 percent of Arizona\u2019s believe voters should show photo ID to cast ballots \u2013 either in-person or by mail.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nAs to the restructuring of the FEC, 77 percent of Arizonans oppose the effort to make it a partisan body. The same percentage of Arizonans reject the idea of a \"New York City-style\" campaign finance system that funnels taxpayer dollars to political candidates.\nIf these numbers don\u2019t move Kelly and Sinema to break away from the Democratic Machine on H.R. 1, however, McLaughlin\u2019s survey revealed a few more key results:\n*Sixty-nine percent of Arizonans believe H.R. 1 benefits the politicians \u2013 not the people.\n*Sixty-three percent want their Senators to vote against the bill.\n*And 52 percent say they are less likely to vote for a senator who votes in favor of H.R. 1.\nArizona is just one example. McLaughlin has also done surveys for West Virginia, Montana, and the whole country on H.R. 1, which I will discuss in a future column.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe American system was designed to resist and break political machines like the one Kamala Harris, Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer are building. This system will be tested when H.R. 1 comes to the Senate.\nDemocrats across the country are going to have to decide whether they will vote with their people or with the Democratic Machine.\nTo read, hear, and watch more of Newt\u2019s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH",

    "body": "options and expanding access to mail ballots, but is more scaled back than an original version that would have broadly remade the election process. The new bill could come to the Senate floor as early as next week. Klobuchar in a statement Tuesday said that the legislation will \u201cset basic national standards to make sure all Americans can cast their ballots in the way that works best for them, regardless of what zip code they live in.\u201d The latest package is meant to serve as a substitute for a sweeping piece of legislation that included a slew of ethics and campaign finance provisions that would have completely remade how candidates and officeholders can raise and spend money, along with the much-discussed election provisions. The House and Senate designated the original bill H.R. 1 and S. 1, respectively, to mark its importance to Democratic leadership. The new version of the ethics and elections reform bill includes standards for states that require voter identification. In addition, lawmakers added a provision that's intended to protect the certification of election results and independence of local officials. The legislation would also establish grants for states that would go toward election administration and would provide public financing for House races. The compromise bill keeps a provision from the original version that would require a much larger swath of politically active groups to disclose their donors. Democrats argue the legislation is necessary to combat laws in Republican-led states like Texas and Georgia that have added voting restrictions. While all 50 Senate Democrats are on board, the legislation has no backing from Senate Republicans, making final passage impossible without changes to the upper chamber's rules. Senate Republicans used the filibuster to block H.R. 1, which previously passed the House in March, and argued the legislation amounts to a federal takeover of elections. Key centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), meanwhile, had previously called the legislation too broad. The latest election and ethics reform bill is the result of months of negotiation between Klobuchar, Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as Democratic caucus members Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Angus King of Maine, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Alex Padilla of California and Jon Tester of Montana. But without the support of 10 Senate Republicans, Klobuchar's legislation will almost certainly face the same fate as the original package: a filibuster. Civil rights leaders have long warned that Senate Democrats must make a choice between protecting voting rights and the filibuster, and have urged the caucus to at least carve out an exception to the rules for voting rights legislation. But Democratic senators like Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have repeatedly said they have no interest in scrapping the filibuster, even if it's just for voting rights legislation. Some advocates for H.R. 1 have privately hoped that the impending filibuster of the election and ethics reform package will highlight Republicans stonewalling the legislation and get Manchin and others to reconsider their stance on Senate rules. Schumer has not tipped his hand on rules changes. But the New York Democrat has vowed that \u201cfailure is not an option.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear, Republicans refusing to support anything on voting rights is not an excuse for Democrats to do nothing,\u201d Schumer said Monday.",

That will unite the country.\"\nCarlson went on to point out that a line in Sarbanes' bill reads that a state government cannot require voters to provide \"any form of identification\" in seeking an absentee ballot.\n\"Under H.R. 1, [people] could freely\u00a0go house to house and apartment\u00a0to apartment collecting unknown\u00a0thousands of ballots and then\u00a0dump them all in a\u00a0ballot dropbox.\u00a0No one would have any idea if\u00a0those ballots had been tampered\u00a0with at any point along the way\u00a0or would there be any way to\u00a0prove it if they had been\u00a0tampered with,\" he continued.\u00a0\n\"H.R. 1 also makes it harder for\u00a0election observers to file\u00a0complaints about any of this\u00a0because complaining is racist.\"\n\"A system like that is suicidal\u00a0for democracy and no other free\u00a0country would tolerate it.\"\nCarlson further pointed out that Canada and France have prohibitions on mail-in ballots, while the party in power in the U.S. seeks the opposite remedy.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe host went on to contrast the Democrats' call for open, unaccountable voting with surprising contravening messaging from an entity he said is otherwise friendly to the left: Jeff Bezos' Amazon.\n\"When it's their power at stake\u00a0Democrats have a totally\u00a0different position,\" he said, remarking on Amazon corporate's criticism of mail-in type balloting for its unionization election in Alabama.\n\"You should know this is not\u00a0considered hypocrisy.\u00a0They don't mind if they are\u00a0caught breaking their own rules,\u00a0they are not offended by double\u00a0standards.\u00a0They want power, this is a power\u00a0grab and that's all it is,\" he said.\nHe went on to point to legislation from Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., noting that the Orlando lawmaker is proposing a bill that would, in the host's words, \"ban anyone with the wrong\u00a0opinions from having a\u00a0significant job in the federal\u00a0government.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Believe forbidden things and you\u00a0don't get a security clearance.\u00a0You can't work here,\" he said. \"Murphy's bill would require\u00a0federal investigators to ask all\u00a0applicants whether they had 'associated with or knowingly\u00a0engaged in activities conducted\u00a0by an organization or movement\u00a0that spreads conspiracy theories\u00a0and false information about the\u00a0United States government.'.\"\nCarlson noted that by Murphy's standards, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., would potentially be unable to hold his current job -- which is in the federal government -- due to repeatedly pushing claims about President Trump's alleged collusion with the Kremlin; going on to play a montage of the Burbank lawmaker's public statements.\n\"At this point [Murphy's bill's criteria] would include\u00a0everyone pretty much currently\u00a0in power,\" said Carlson. \"That hurt our country, but this\u00a0is designed to protect them from\u00a0criticism.\"\n\"Under Stephanie Murphy's bill, anyone who criticizes\u00a0Stephanie Murphy could be\u00a0punished.\u00a0Make sense now?\"",

    "body": "While Americans are focused on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s vacation, (Mr.) Potato Head and the debate over the COVID-19 relief package proposed by President Joe Biden, Democrats in Congress are attempting to pass an unprecedented, radical piece of legislation which would reshape American election law, destroy privacy protections and undermine election integrity.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this bill, H.R. 1, just passed the House of Representatives last night, and only a single Democrat had the courage to vote against it.\n H.R. 1, referred to by its sponsors as the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d has received little media attention since it was introduced Jan. 4. This isn\u2019t because Democrats and their media allies are not supportive of the bill \u2014 quite the contrary \u2014 it\u2019s that the far left is scared of Americans finding out what the legislation contains. In the infamous words of Nancy Pelosi during the Affordable Care Act debate, Democrats are trying to pass this bill before Americans see what\u2019s in it.\n H.R. 1 undermines the sovereignty of states to enforce their own election laws as determined by Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution. In an unprecedented move, the legislation would create a three-judge panel tasked with redrawing congressional districts \u2014 stripping state legislatures of their power in this area. The granting of this authority to unelected jurists, rather than officials who have been chosen by their constituents to make these decisions, is central to this leftist power grab.\n The far-left lunacy doesn\u2019t end there. One of the most dangerous parts of H.R. 1 is its gutting of privacy protections for donors to organizations involved in political activity. As a result of this provision, any individuals who donate to a political group will have their names and other personal information handed over to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n   While supporters of the bill contend that this is being done in the interest of \u201ctransparency,\u201d this seemingly innocent excuse couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Listing the names and personal details of political donors will scare countless Americans out of participating in the civic process.\n And we all know what happened the last time the IRS was controlled by Democrats: President Obama\u2019s administration selectively targeted businesses based on their affiliation with the Tea Party. Given that Democrats haven\u2019t hesitated to use the IRS in the past to go after political dissidents, why should Americans \u2014 particularly conservatives \u2014 willingly give a record of their political donations to a federal government and IRS dominated by those same Democrats?\n Sadly, that\u2019s just the beginning. H.R. 1 would gut voter ID laws by undermining states\u2019 ability to implement voter ID laws \u2014 instead, voters can simply sign a statement affirming that they are the individual they claim to be. This alternative would open the door to fraud in voter registration, as well as double voting and voting by non-citizens; all of which would undermine American election integrity.\n \n Arguably, the most corrupt provision of H.R. 1 is a 6-to-1 federal subsidy provided for certain candidates for small dollar donations. If this legislation is passed, it would mean that millions of tax dollars would be allocated to support political campaigns and causes which the taxpayers themselves may oppose. Imagine if the tax dollars of conservative voters went towards the warchests of far left progressives like AOC, or if liberal voters\u2019 tax dollars were used to fund Ted Cruz\u2019 re-election bid \u2014 this would be a reality if H.R. 1 was signed into law.\n Americans are justifiably paying attention to the news regarding COVID-19 relief and the latest from the Biden administration. However, the debate surrounding H.R. 1 remains just as important. If President Biden and Democrats in the Senate are able to ram through this legislation, it would be a disaster for election security, the Constitution, and our country.\n Noah Wall is vice president of Advocacy at FreedomWorks, a nationwide grassroots organization dedicated to lower taxes, smaller government, individual liberty and the American rule of law.",

SFG is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on empowering growth, solutions and resiliency after traumas and burns. SFG's advocacy project called Not Your Turn To Burn announced the passage of Bill H.R. 806, the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act (PFCSA), which has the potential to prevent thousands of burn injuries and hundreds of deaths each year in America.The passage of H.R. 806, sponsored by Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), is a crucial step forward for consumer safety. The National Fire Protection Agency's data shows that every year 4,000 people are burned and 450 die because flammable liquid containers can explode while responsibly tipping or pouring flammable liquids.\"I'm here this week to thank members of Congress, including ones who are veterans and have seen burn injuries up close, for taking action,\" said Lewis, an unpaid advocate. \"H.R. 806 requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to adhere to stricter safety protocols\u2014allowing everyday heating, cooking, lighting and science demonstrations to be done without risk of burn explosion injuries.

    "body": "It's called the Project Older Job Applicants Act of 2021, or POJA (H.R. 3992), and it has the potential to level the playing field for older job applicants, who for the last decade or more have found themselves turned away from jobs because of their age. While some companies have been open about hiring only younger candidates, others have disguised their actions by suggesting older candidates are overqualified.  Who doesn't want a highly skilled employee?  Companies that are ageist.  POJA serves two primary purposes. First, it prohibits employers from limiting, segregating or classifying job applicants based on an applicant's age. This is important because it means companies can no longer discount older applicants who meet the qualifications.  The bill also requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to study and report on claims received from job applicants involving age discrimination. Past complaints filed under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which the EEOC administers, have been rejected because the EEOC doesn't \u201cpursue cases of this nature.\u201d That means companies everywhere can ignore older candidates, and the EEOC could care less.  It's ageist. It's unfair. And without the passing of H.R. 3992 nothing will change and older workers everywhere will suffer.  Why Party-Line Voting Hurts Older People  Yes, this is about political division. Here's why.  H.R. 3992 was introduced by last June by Texas Democrat Sylvia Garcia. On 4 November, the bill passed 224 to 200, the voting record clearly showing a party split. Democrats voting in favor, Republicans voting against\u2013save five who crossed party lines to support constituent need.  The bill now resides in the Senate, where it was sent to committee. Should Republicans prevent the passing of this bill, it will be an injustice. If there were ever a time to write your Senator with a plea for support, it would be now.  After the House vote, MSN published an article stating Republicans felt the bill was unnecessary because existing law already provides older people with protections. But existing legislation only protects older employees, not applicants.  As Rep. Garcia states, this bill simply clarifies that existing legislation begins at the time of application. It is a minor but critical technicality given that U.S. Courts are split in their interpretation of when protections begin.  After contacting my Texas Senators to ask for the support of H.R. 3992, a response from Senator John Cornyn confirms the Republican stance.  \u201cAddressing cases of workplace discrimination requires enforcing existing regulations. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and protects against discrimination on the basis of disability and age. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing these regulations.\u201d  No, Sir, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does not protect older job applicants, many who lost their jobs due to COVID and are applying desperately for another job.  No, Sir, the EEOC does not look into cases of applicant discrimination where it concerns age. I have a letter from the EEOC to prove it.  For older job applicants, this Republican position spells a future of financial hardship. What will it take for Republicans to look at the facts and vote accordingly?

That will unite the country.\"\nCarlson went on to point out that a line in Sarbanes' bill reads that a state government cannot require voters to provide \"any form of identification\" in seeking an absentee ballot.\n\"Under H.R. 1, [people] could freely\u00a0go house to house and apartment\u00a0to apartment collecting unknown\u00a0thousands of ballots and then\u00a0dump them all in a\u00a0ballot dropbox.\u00a0No one would have any idea if\u00a0those ballots had been tampered\u00a0with at any point along the way\u00a0or would there be any way to\u00a0prove it if they had been\u00a0tampered with,\" he continued.\u00a0\n\"H.R. 1 also makes it harder for\u00a0election observers to file\u00a0complaints about any of this\u00a0because complaining is racist.\"\n\"A system like that is suicidal\u00a0for democracy and no other free\u00a0country would tolerate it.\"\nCarlson further pointed out that Canada and France have prohibitions on mail-in ballots, while the party in power in the U.S. seeks the opposite remedy.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe host went on to contrast the Democrats' call for open, unaccountable voting with surprising contravening messaging from an entity he said is otherwise friendly to the left: Jeff Bezos' Amazon.\n\"When it's their power at stake\u00a0Democrats have a totally\u00a0different position,\" he said, remarking on Amazon corporate's criticism of mail-in type balloting for its unionization election in Alabama.\n\"You should know this is not\u00a0considered hypocrisy.\u00a0They don't mind if they are\u00a0caught breaking their own rules,\u00a0they are not offended by double\u00a0standards.\u00a0They want power, this is a power\u00a0grab and that's all it is,\" he said.\nHe went on to point to legislation from Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., noting that the Orlando lawmaker is proposing a bill that would, in the host's words, \"ban anyone with the wrong\u00a0opinions from having a\u00a0significant job in the federal\u00a0government.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Believe forbidden things and you\u00a0don't get a security clearance.\u00a0You can't work here,\" he said. \"Murphy's bill would require\u00a0federal investigators to ask all\u00a0applicants whether they had 'associated with or knowingly\u00a0engaged in activities conducted\u00a0by an organization or movement\u00a0that spreads conspiracy theories\u00a0and false information about the\u00a0United States government.'.\"\nCarlson noted that by Murphy's standards, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., would potentially be unable to hold his current job -- which is in the federal government -- due to repeatedly pushing claims about President Trump's alleged collusion with the Kremlin; going on to play a montage of the Burbank lawmaker's public statements.\n\"At this point [Murphy's bill's criteria] would include\u00a0everyone pretty much currently\u00a0in power,\" said Carlson. \"Yes, they were knee deep in conspiracy theories that actually hurt our country in measurable ways -- but this\u00a0legislation isn't designed to punish them -- just the opposite -- this legislation is\u00a0designed to protect them from your criticism.\"\n\"Under Stephanie Murphy's bill, anyone who criticizes\u00a0Stephanie Murphy could be\u00a0punished.\u00a0Make sense now?\"",

Res. 601, the resolution that contains the rule for the House to consider the so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill, otherwise known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, S. Con. Res. 14, the budget resolution, and H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021.\n\nThe measure passed 220-212, after House moderate Democrats led a revolt against Pelosi. Democrats passed the bill on partisan lines, with strong GOP opposition to the bill.\n\nThe rule stipulated that by passing H. Res. 601, it would also consider the budget adopted.\n\nModerate Democrats wanted assurances from Pelosi that they would consider the bipartisan infrastructure bill, believing that the delay could tank the bill.\n\nModerate Democrats voted for the bill after Pelosi promised them that they would vote for the bill by September. The moderates initially wanted consideration within one week.\n\nReps. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-GA), Ed Case (D-HI), Jim Costa (D-CA), Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Jared Golden (D-ME), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), Kurt Schrader (D-OR), Filemon Vela (D-FL), have served as part of the group leading the resistance against Pelosi. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) joined the group of moderates revolting against the Speaker.\n\n\u201cIn consultation with the Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am committing to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill by September 27.\u00a0\u00a0I do so with a commitment to rally House Democratic support for its passage,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement:\n\nThe rule contains a provision that would allow for Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-OR) or his \u201cdesignee\u201d to concur or pass it without changes or amendments to the bill. The rule reads:\n\nProvides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3684. 9. Makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure or his designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3684. 10. Waives all points of order against consideration of the Senate amendment and the motion. 11. Provides that the Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read.\n\nThis might prevent the House from amending the bill, including a $30 billion cryptocurrency provision that pro-crypto lawmakers such as Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC) have warned could send American jobs overseas.\n\nAdam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, said in a statement after the vote:\n\nHouse Democrats are sinking to new lows in order to pass their ridiculous tax and spending spree. Using a self-executing rule to pass a budget resolution is the absolute antithesis of proper budgetary process. When statutory rules are ignored and deliberation quashed, bad policy is always the result. Today\u2019s actions demonstrate the continued mockery that Democrats are making out of our legislative process, and, unfortunately, taxpayers will be the ones suffering the consequences from their carelessness.\n\n\u201cOn process alone, House Republicans should stand united against Speaker Pelosi\u2019s ploy to railroad the Budget Resolution through the House,\u201d Brandon added.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Joe Manchin praised a Tuesday morning meeting with civil rights leaders, calling it \"constructive\" and \"informative,\" but maintained his opposition to a sweeping set of election overhaul measures known as the For the People Act. \n   \"I don't think anybody changed positions on that. We're just learning where everybody's coming from,\" the West Virginia Democrat told Capitol Hill reporters after the meeting, which included the heads of the National Urban League, the NAACP, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and others.\n   The meeting came two days after Manchin announced in an op-ed for the Charleston Gazette-Mail that he wouldn't support the elections reform and voting rights bill, citing a lack of bipartisanship.\n   \"Congressional action on federal voting rights legislation must be the result of both Democrats and Republicans coming together to find a pathway forward or we risk further dividing and destroying the republic we swore to protect and defend as elected officials,\" he wrote. \n   Manchin's opposition is seen as a death knell for the legislation, which every other Democratic senator is co-sponsoring and which Democrats argue is the necessary remedy to efforts by Republican-led states to pass restrictive election laws. \n      Despite Manchin's steadfast stance on the legislation, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the meeting \"productive\" and said he believes Manchin is someone \"committed to making democracy work.\" \n   \"Our goal was to establish and build the relationship [with Manchin] and we accomplished that,\" he told NPR. \"Now the real work starts because the commitment from the senator and from us is that we would maintain the dialogue and work as hard as possible to come up with a solution that can actually become policy.\" \n   He added: \"The work of the NAACP in this moment is around the outcome to protect the rights of voters and one meeting won't solve that.\"\n   Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, also said it was a good first meeting. \n   \"[Manchin] was very much in a listening mode. He shared his viewpoints,\" she told NPR. \"He seemed to really have a deep concern that our democracy is really at a crossroads.\"\n   Campbell said she discussed in the meeting how the filibuster has historically been used to block civil rights legislation. \n   \"And here we are in 2021 with a Senate...that could actually stop the ability to make voting rights reform when we are having an all-out assault on voting rights all over this country.\" \n      Since Democrats hold the thinnest of majorities in the Senate, they either need 10 Republicans to join them in supporting the legislation, which is extremely unlikely, or they need to eliminate the filibuster and allow the bill to advance with a simple majority, something Manchin has repeatedly said he opposes.  \n   Speaking with CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Manchin said he wants to work to get Republicans on board with passing a voting rights bill. \n   \"I'm going to fight for this and I think the Republicans will fight for this and understand we must come together on a voting rights bill in a bipartisan way,\" he said.\n   Manchin supports H.R. 4, also known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n   But that measure is also unlikely to get support from ten Republican senators. \n   Johnson commended Manchin for his support of H.R. 4 but said it's not encompassing of everything that he believes is needed. \n   \"That piece of legislation is important as you look forward, but there's some recent activity that we also have to address by states like Georgia and several other jurisdictions so that individuals have access to voting free and clear from voter suppression methods,\" he said. \n   Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters Tuesday morning that \"it's not an either or proposition\" between the two pieces of legislation. \n   \"I'm glad that we have the John Lewis bill, appropriately named in his honor,\" he said. \"But let's be clear, John Lewis spent his last 10 years fighting for the provisions of the For the People Act, because he understood that over the last decade, we've seen an assault on voting rights across our country that sought to roll back the very protections that he fought for.\" \n   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues Tuesday that H.R. 4 won't be ready until the fall and shouldn't be considered a \"substitute\" for H.R.1. \n   \"Congressman John Lewis wrote 300 pages of H.R. 1 to end voter suppression,\" she wrote. \"It would be our hope to have this pass the House and Senate in a bipartisan way.\"\n   Democrats plan to hold a vote on the measure later this month, even though it's expected to fail.",

It would end the partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, increase election security and, for the first time in U.S. history, give candidates for Congress a real opportunity to rely on small contributors alone to fund their campaigns. The bill would also impose substantial ethics regulations on Congress, the Supreme Court and the president. And it would be funded by fines, penalties and settlements from corporate tax, lobbying and financial fraud cases.\n\nThe breadth of its ambition is a strength, not weakness. Americans are deeply skeptical of their government. Overwhelmingly, they believe that Congress serves not them, but the special interests who pay for campaigns. Many are deeply and rightly angry at the efforts by states to suppress their vote. Others are frustrated with legislatures that draw districts to permanently entrench a political minority as a majority. And practically everyone thinks that every branch of our government must commit to higher ethical ideals. We are told we have the greatest democracy in the world. Yet very few who know anything about how it actually functions believe this.\n\nH.R. 1 responds to these frustrations by addressing each aspect directly. Not every American is concerned with every part. But any American awake to political reality is convinced of at least part. Voters in Iowa are less concerned with gerrymandering \u2014 because that doesn\u2019t happen in Iowa. But many voters in Iowa are appalled by a campaign funding system that just gave them the second-most-expensive Senate race in U.S. history, with 75 percent of the money coming from outside the state. The strategy of H.R. 1 is to address the common perception that our government doesn\u2019t work for us, even if the particular flaws that might anger any group of citizens may be different.\n\nIf H.R. 1 gets dismembered, this common purpose disappears. Yes, of course, Congress should address the growing problem of vote suppression. But if that\u2019s all it addresses, many members have less cause to champion it. Congress should address gerrymandering, but Iowa, Michigan, Arizona, California, and Ohio already have, and so the urgency is less for their representatives. Practically every American laments the corrupting influence of money in politics, but why should voters in districts without adequate polling places worry about how campaigns are funded? We all see problems with our democracy, but the problems we all see are not the same.\n\nMistaken pragmatists, however, insist that Democrats should satisfy themselves with reforms in voting rights and possibly gerrymandering. They would abandon reforms in campaign finance and transparency, as well as ethics.\n\nBut no voter is going to turn against a representative because they\u2019ve passed ethics reform. And a key potential swing vote in the Senate right now has been a longtime advocate of campaign finance and transparency reform. As governor of West Virginia, Joe Manchin III (D) pressed the state to publicly fund judicial elections. As a U.S. senator, Manchin has been a longtime co-sponsor of campaign finance reform in Congress as well, observing that \u201cthe people of West Virginia are also deeply troubled by the increasing role that money is playing in our politics.\u201d In that same speech, Manchin lamented the time that members must spend raising money from a very few number of large donors \u2014 one of the problems that H.R. 1 addresses.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that passing H.R. 1 will be difficult and could be blocked by the filibuster. But it is a mistake to believe that going smaller would make it easier. Instead, what we need now is a clear articulation of the very simple principle that stands behind everything in this bill \u2014 that in a representative democracy, the institutions of that democracy must be representative. Ours are not. Without the reforms of H.R. 1, our precariously majoritarian system will become predictably minoritarian. And for that, there is neither moral nor political justification, let alone strategic wisdom.",

That is, if the U.S. Senate passes the bill and it\u2019s signed into law by President Joseph Biden.Our auditors at OpenTheBooks.com read the 800-page H.R. 1 and found the new holiday for federal employees in Section 1909, \u201cElection Day As Legal Public Holiday.\u201d The provision kicks in next year and continues every two years covering both congressional and presidential election years.Despite transparency promises, the new federal holiday wasn\u2019t included in published versions of the legislation. It\u2019s buried on page 16 of their 78-page \u201cmanager\u2019s\u201d amendment.In the House, the bill passed without a single vote from a Republican and requires states to allow early voting for 15 days prior to election day, for \u201cno less than 10 hours\u201d each day, and to allow any individual to cast a ballot for any reason by absentee ballot by mail.All these new provisions would strip the states of setting other own rules, and would also seem to mitigate the need for a new federal employee holiday.Currently, the 10 annual paid vacation days for federal employees are:There\u2019s also the extra Presidential Inauguration vacation day, given every four years to all federal employees on Jan. 20, regardless of whether they are affected by the festivities or thousands of miles away from them.Previously, National Taxpayers Union estimated the cost of a federal holiday based on Office of Personnel Management data. The formula is total executive branch civilian non-Post Office annual payroll ( $198.5 billion in FY 2019) divided by 260, the number of working days, plus a premium pay that is approximately 7.2 percent of base holiday pay.RollCall.com reported the election day holiday idea has popped up before, but was stripped after Republicans, such as then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, \u201clambasted the idea of giving Americans the day off.\u201dOne report noted in 2019 the holiday was stripped because there were extended voting opportunities for federal employees.McConnell said in January 2019, \u201cJust what America needs, another paid holiday and a bunch of government workers being paid to go out and work, I assume... [for] our colleagues on the other side, on their campaigns.\u201d He called the effort the \u201cDemocrat Politician Protection Act.\u201dThe office of Rep.

    "body": "By Larry Keane\n Congressman Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) isn\u2019t given to hyperbole. When he speaks, he means what he says. It\u2019s worth paying attention.\n It\u2019s too bad his fellow Members of Congress would rather listen to gun control sycophants instead of serving the people they were elected to represent.\n U.S. Rep. Hudson lit into U.S. House of Representative Democrats for rushing gun control bills to the floor for a vote. Two bills are being pushed that were passed by the House in the last Congress, but never got attention in the Senate.\u00a0H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, was introduced by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and\u00a0H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, was introduced by Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.).\n   Rep. Hudson ripped Congress for capitalizing on half-truths to rob Americans of their Second Amendment rights at a Republican press availability this week.\n Call It What It Is\n \u201cUnfortunately, the Democrats in Congress are not serious about ending gun violence,\u201d Congressman Hudson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s obvious by the bills \u2013 they\u2019re bringing up four this week \u2013 which would do nothing to have stopped a single mass shooting in this country, yet, they threaten the rights of law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n \n Rep. Hudson reminded reporters that he is a father of a five-year-old attending school and the concerns of criminal misuse of firearms in schools resonates deeply. He pointed to concrete action championed by Congress including the Fix NICS Act, named for NSSF\u2019s\u00a0FixNICS\u00ae\u00a0campaign, that compels federal agencies and provides resources to states to submit all disqualifying records especially adjudicated mental health records to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Firearm retailers rely on NICS records being up to date and accurate when running point-of-sale instant background checks for a firearm sale.\n \u201cThe Democrats have rushed two bills to the floor, no regular order, no hearing time,\u201d Rep. Hudson continued. \u201cThey have allowed no meaningful input from Republicans and \u2013 and these bills, again, would have not stopped a single mass shooting, not Newtown, not Charleston, not Parkland, not Las Vegas, not Sutherland Springs, would not have stopped the shooting of our former colleague, Gabrielle Giffords because her shooter passed a background check.\u201d\n The North Carolina congressman lambasted gun control Members of Congress for rushing legislation that\u2019s disingenuous.\n \u201cH.R. 8 fails to recognize the fact that every commercial gun sale in America requires a background check today,\u201d Rep. Hudson explained. \u201cAnd H.R. 1446 creates delays for law-abiding citizens, could be indefinite to acquire a weapon and would have not closed the Charleston loophole.\u201d\n Rep. Hudson explained that the failure on the murders in Charleston, S.C.\u2019s Emmanuel AME Church was a matter of law enforcement not sharing disqualifying criminal information with the FBI. He said that a fix would be Rep. Tom Rice\u2019s\u00a0H.R. 1518, a bill which codifies current NICS practices.\n Legislation That Works\n Rep. Hudson also\u00a0announced\u00a0the introduction of The STOP II: Classrooms Over Conference Rooms Act, which would add an extra $100 million a year to fund the STOP School Violence Act. That law was signed in 2018 to make schools safer by providing resources to harden schools and train students, teachers and local law enforcement to help stop school violence before it happens. The funds for Rep. Hudson\u2019s bill are taken from money allocated to the U.S. Department of Education to rent conference rooms in Washington, D.C.\n \u201cRepublicans have meaningful alternatives and we have six bills that have been introduced last week and this week,\u201d Rep. Hudson explained. \u201cWe will be pushing to end gun violence. Our legislation would actually address this problem. The Democrats are concerned about taking away our Second Amendment rights, and the two bills this week will simply erode those rights.\u201d\n                            Larry Keane is Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs and General Counsel for the\u00a0National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association.",

This issue has come up many times in the past, like back in 2015 when certain automakers tried pushing for a copyright law that would\u2019ve made repairing your own vehicle illegal. With the risk of such nonsense advancing as technologies evolve, a group of Democrats and Republicans in the US House of Representatives have banded together to pass the REPAIR Act (H.R. 906).\n\nLearn why Toyota taking it slow on EVs might be a smart move here.\n\nBecause people inside the Beltway just love clever acronyms, REPAIR stands for the Right to Equitable and Professional Auto Industry Repair. This isn\u2019t the first time this piece of legislation has been introduced to Congress. This time around, Neal Dunn (R-FL), Brendan Boyle (D-PA-02), Warren Davidson (R-OH-08), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA-03) are presenting it to House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nWhat the sponsors argue is this act would not only preserve your right to repair your car but also empower independent repair shops to not get pushed out of the business. Among the provisions included is keeping diagnostic data, on-board diagnostics, and telematics systems accessible to all shops, not just dealership service departments.\n\nAt the same time, H.R. 906 seeks to increase cybersecurity as cars become part of the Internet of Things. In its present form, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would be required to develop standards for how onboard data necessary for repairing a car can be accessed securely.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Chevrolet create the C8 Corvette with its \u201cunhackable\u201d ECU. Ford is following that lead with the S650 Mustang. What concerns people in the repair industry is that they might not be able to perform certain repairs on these and a growing number of cars, essentially squeezing them out of business while dealerships enjoy an unrivaled level of vehicle repair access.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big question to ask is will H.R. 906 fix the problem and without awful unforeseen consequences? We encourage you to read the REPAIR Act in its current form here when it\u2019s updated and decide for yourself.\n\nSource: Auto Car Association\n\nImages via Cottonbro Studio, Andrea Picquadio\n\nSign up for the Motorious Newsletter.

    "body": "For months, the party's marquee voting-rights measures - the For the People Act (H.R. 1) and the John Lewis Voting Advancement Act (H.R. 4) - have stalled in Congress. The previous version of the For the People Act included provisions to ban partisan gerrymandering, expand early and absentee voting, establish national standards for voter registration, and curb voter purges, among other measures. The bill would also mandate that states offer mail-in ballots and same-day voter registration, policies which are anathema to conservatives. The House passed the previous version of the bill, but it has languished in the Senate - Democrats need 60 votes to advance the legislation and Republicans have so far refused to sign on to H.R. 1 and filibustered the bill in June. For months, Manchin and Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have dismissed calls to nix the filibuster, saying that such an action would only inflame partisan divisions. Even if the compromise bill receives 50 votes, Democrats still need 10 crossover votes. Republicans, who have passed of wave of restrictive voting laws across the country, have accused their colleagues across the aisle of seeking to \"federalize\" what they feel are election matters that should be within the purview of states. Democrats contend that the GOP-led voting laws have imperiled the voting rights of everyday Americans, while conservatives argue that the bills are designed to shield the voting process from nefarious activity - despite the low rates of significant voter fraud. Since joining the Senate, Padilla, who previously oversaw California's elections as secretary of state, has called for the elimination of the filibuster In March, after the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package passed through the reconciliation process on a party-line vote, Padilla blasted GOP attempts to stop the bill as a pattern that was becoming politically untenable. \"If we continue to see obstruction from our Republican colleagues as we saw through this COVID relief package, then I think the patience is going to wear thin, even on moderate Democrats,\" he said at the time. When asked by Hasan whether he agreed with his Golden State Senate colleague, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said in June that she didn't view democracy as \"being in jeopardy right now,\" Padilla took a different view \"Democracy is clearly in jeopardy,\" he said. \"What I can say is that a lot of my colleagues that may have been reticent earlier in the year to modify or abolish the filibuster continue to see the obstruction by not just Mitch McConnell but our Republican colleagues across the board.\" Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "body": "In the aftermath of the GOP's assault on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election and amid a torrent of Republican measures aimed at restricting voting rights in the name of security, Democrats are pushing for a far-reaching solution to counter attempts at narrowing access to the ballot box.\nH.R. 1, known as the For the People Act, seeks to abolish hurdles to voting, reform the role of money in politics and tighten federal ethics rules. Among the key tenets of the bill to overhaul the nation's election system: allowing for no-excuse mail voting, at least 15 days of early voting, automatic voter registration and restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences.\nDemocrats' comprehensive bill passed the House -- for the second time -- nearly along party lines earlier this month and was introduced in the Senate this week. But it faces steep opposition from the GOP over its potential implications for future elections, including the 2022 midterms, with some Republicans openly fretting that broader access to voting will harm the party's chances.\nFor Republicans, H.R. 1 represents a Democratic \"power grab\" that could tilt elections in their favor for years to come, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., put it. One Arizona state lawmaker called it \"anti-Republican.\"\n\"H.R. 1 is an attempt to use the Democrats' slim majority to unlevel the playing field and take away the rights of roughly half of the voters in the country,\" said Mark Weaver, a GOP consultant based in Ohio and an election law attorney.\nOther Republicans condemn the bill as a naked federal overreach of states' rights, saying the legislation will usurp the decentralized electoral system in favor of a nationalized, one-size-fits-all approach.\nAnd some Republican lawmakers, officials and strategists go even further, signaling the GOP's opposition to such extensive electoral reforms is based on the fear it will cause them to lose elections.\n\"If the Democrats pass H.R. 1, it's going to be absolutely devastating for Republicans in this country,\" said Jay Williams, a Republican strategist in Georgia, a state seeing one of the most aggressive campaigns to restrict voting. \"They're just going to basically just shaft so many Republicans in places where they would actually have opportunities to pick up.\"\n\nSupporters of President Donald Trump participate on a 'Stop the Steal' protest at the Georgia State Capitol, after the 2020 presidential election was called for Democratic candidate Joe Biden, in Atlanta, Nov. 7, 2020.\n\n\n\n\nIn Arizona, another battleground seeing an onslaught of election-related legislative battles, state Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican, told CNN, \"Democrats value as many people as possible voting, and they're willing to risk fraud. Republicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don't mind putting security measures in that won't let everybody vote -- but everybody shouldn't be voting.\"\nAfter more than a decade of Republicans scaling back voting access, the latest push comes after former President Donald Trump and his allies spent months seeding distrust in the electoral system based on fabricated claims of a \"stolen\" election.\nThe measure comes as many Republican state lawmakers, some of whom peddled Trump's baseless allegations of widespread fraud, are now leaning into what they cast as a lack of confidence in the democratic process to justify their election-related offensive. Republican state lawmakers across 43 states have advanced at least 250 bills so far aimed at limiting absentee and early voting and implementing stricter voter ID laws, among other provisions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nThe debate over H.R. 1 reflects the broader reckoning within the GOP over how to win elections in the post-Trump era, when the most significant motivator for both sides is no longer on the ballot. With both history and conventional wisdom pointing to an advantage for the out-of-power party in midterms, some Republicans are convinced H.R. 1 could make a difference.\n\"I think stopping [H.R. 1] is more relative to Republican success in the future than Donald Trump,\" Williams said, as the former president remains the most influential Republican in the party. \"The ramifications of passing legislation like that would be very difficult for Republicans to win a majority status after that.\"\nBut Republican fears don't necessarily permeate in states where -- even with more people voting -- they found success in 2020, such as North Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\"I think it's a mistake for Republicans to believe that under any particular voting model they can't win elections. I think that's wrong and absurd, but it's the same error the Democrats are making trying to push H.R. 1,\" said Michael Adams, Kentucky's Republican secretary of state, before adding that in the last election, high turnout resulted in more registered Republicans participating than Democrats for the first time in the state's history.\nDemocrats, for their part, point to the wholesale Republican push to curb voting rights as the impetus for more urgently pressing ahead on H.R. 1, which could serve as a backstop to thwart the state-level clamp down on voting.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House on March 18, 2021, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden made clear in a statement that the bill's reforms were \"urgently needed,\" adding that he looks \"forward to signing it into law after it has passed through the legislative process.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., underlined the string of attacks from Republicans on the electoral system in his defense of the Senate's companion bill.\n\"If one political party believes 'heads we win, tails you cheated,' if one political party believes that when you lose an election, the answer isn't to win more votes, but rather to try to prevent the other side from voting, then we have serious and existential threats to our democracy on our hands,\" Schumer said Wednesday. \"That's why we need S.1. so badly.\"\nThe proposal faces a tricky path forward to overcome the 60-vote threshold in the evenly divided Senate unless Democrats reform the filibuster.\nBiden said in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he isn't opposed to looking at a return to the \"talking filibuster,\" which would require opposing senators to ceaselessly speak on the Senate floor until the bill is dropped or proponents have the votes.\nSchumer made clear during a press conference Wednesday that Democrats will \"decide the appropriate action to take\" on the bill since \"failure is not an option.\"",

Carbajal, D-Calif., to codify into law the presumption that heart disease, lung disease, and certain cancers in firefighters in the federal government are caused by firefighting duties.

Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said: \"By singling out federal firefighters, this bill is not fair to postal workers with skin cancer or federal nurses with lung cancer.

Berhe is a soil sciences professor at the University of California-Merced. A supporter, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said: \"Judging from the long list of academic honors and awards that she has received and the long list of scientific papers that she has written, Dr. Berhe has the scientific credentials this job requires.\" An opponent, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said of Berhe: \"Her background and her experience have very little to do with the Department of Energy's main scientific focus.\" The vote, on May 10, was 54 yeas to 45 nays.

He has called for states to essentially nullify federal immigration law.\" The vote, on May 11, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st yea vote.  YEAS: Manchin  NAYS: Capito  Abortion: The Senate rejected a cloture motion to end debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of the Women's Health Protection Act (S. 4132), sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. The bill would have changed federal law to bar restrictions on abortion before fetal viability or in cases after viability where a medical provider states that continued pregnancy would risk the woman's health or life. Blumenthal said the bill was needed because of the threat of \"a ban nationwide on abortion, that would override even the states like Connecticut that are seeking to legislate protections for women that will make us a safe harbor and haven.\" An opponent, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called the bill an extreme measure, and said it \"would create a right for nondoctors to perform abortions, putting women at severe risk of complications and botched procedures.\" The vote to end debate, on May 11, was 49 yeas to 51 nays.  NAYS: Manchin, Capito  Housing Policy: The Senate confirmed the nomination of Julia Gordon to be assistant secretary of housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration.

Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said Gordon \"advocates for throwing more taxpayer money at the housing market despite the fact that it is government intervention that has caused the massive inflation we have seen\" in housing prices. The vote, on May 11, was 50 yeas to 50 nays, with Vice President Harris casting a 51st yea vote.  YEAS: Manchin  NAYS: Capito  Federal Reserve Board: The Senate confirmed the nomination of Philip Jefferson to be a member of the Federal Reserve bank's board of governors for a term ending in 2036.

And will the president do what\u2019s required, whether it\u2019s with or without the filibuster, to make sure that voting rights legislation passes that will guarantee the right of all Americans and, yes, the black Americans that Republicans are trying to disenfranchise, will the president be \u2014 ensure that they have the right to vote?\u201d\n\nBedingfield answered, \u201cYes, he will. You saw him speak to this yesterday, incredibly forcefully, he said what we see going on here is sick, it\u2019s un-American. The idea that the Republican Party is working to try to disenfranchise people, actively prevent them from voting, it runs against everything that we believe as Americans. It runs against the fundamental foundation of democracy that our country\u2019s built on. So, yes, and he is going to work to push forward and ensure that we are signing this legislation into law. He\u2019s committed to it. It\u2019s something that he is going to fight for. It\u2019s something he talked about a lot on the campaign trail. I mean, he believes that this is a core, fundamental right of all Americans, that there\u2019s nothing more important than the right to vote, the right to make your voice heard, and he\u2019s going to push to see this legislation passed.\u201d",

The bill also requires states to offer 15 days of early voting and allows no-excuse absentee balloting, which 14 states would have to implement and the states that already allow it\u00a0would\u00a0have to conform to H.R. 1\u2019s standards.\u00a0\nAs part of the efforts, the Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent $1.3 million on internal lobbyists to push the reforms while dishing out $480,000 to outside firm Keefe Singiser Partners between 2019 and 2020, according to disclosures. Maura Keefe, the former chief of staff for Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, heads up the shop. Over the past year, the Sixteen Thirty Fund also paid $100,000 to Kountoupes Denham Carr  Reid to advocate on democracy reform and election integrity, including H.R.1.\nOne of the lobbyists listed on the disclosure forms for Kountoupes Denham Carr  Reid is MJ Kenny, who worked for Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., between 2010 and 2019 in multiple roles, including legislative correspondent and deputy floor director, according to his LinkedIn profile.\u00a0\n\n      NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 01: Former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg (L) and philanthropist Hansjorg Wyss attend Oceana's 2015 New York City benefit at Four Seasons Restaurant on April 1, 2015 in New York City.

From 2016 to 2020, the foreign national directed $135 million into the fund, but it\u00a0is unclear how his money was spent.\nWhile the Sixteen Thirty Fund is primarily used to house nonprofits that are backed by secretive donors, the incubator was also used as an avenue to steer $55 million in anonymous cash into super PACs that backed President Biden's 2020 campaign.\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund is part of a massive dark money network managed by D.C.-based consulting firm Arabella Advisors, which was founded by Eric Kesser, a former Bill Clinton appointee and member of the Clinton Global Initiative. In 2019, Arabella was paid nearly $34 million for administrative, operations and management services to manage the four funds in Arabella\u2019s vast dark money network. In addition to Sixteen Thirty, Arabella manages the New Venture Fund, Hopewell Fund\u00a0and Windward Fund.\nThe four Arabella-managed funds raked in $715 million in 2019. The funds house projects beneath them that include Demand Justice, Fix Our Senate, Demand Progress, and dozens of other groups. It also passed large sums to outside organizations such as the Center for American Progress, America Votes, Center for Popular Democracy, and Color of Change.\u00a0\nThe network is used by some of the wealthiest progressive financiers in the country, including those in the Democracy Alliance, a group of deep-pocketed donors co-founded by liberal billionaire George Soros. Wyss was recruited to be a part of the secretive network, according to the New York Times.\u00a0\n\n      Hungarian-born US investor and philanthropist George Soros looks on after having delivered a speech on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, on January 23, 2020 in Davos, eastern Switzerland.

The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0Fact Checker knocked Biden\u00a0this week for falsely\u00a0claiming\u00a0the law\u00a0\"ends voting hours early,\" giving him its harshest rating of\u00a0Four Pinocchios for spreading the misinformation.\nWARNOCK DECLINES TO OPPOSE GEORGIA BOYCOTTS OVER NEW ELECTION LAW\nNewt Gingrich:\u00a0Well, first of all, H.R. 1 is the Corrupt Politicians Act. It eliminates all of the barriers that protect us and allow honest citizens to count honest votes. Second, almost everything said about the Georgia law is a lie, just plain a lie. When President Biden reading off, I assume his staff notes said that you couldn't get water standing in line. That's flat, plain untrue. \nYou can, in fact it specifically authorizes the voting officials to provide water for people standing in line if it's hot. When they say it reduces the number of hours you can vote, that's just plain a lie. It actually increases the number of hours you can vote. But here's the deal, Coca-Cola is not going to say a word about all the things that the Chinese totalitarian government does. They're not going to have any courage at all about standing up to China because it costs them too much.\u00a0\n...\nIt's disgraceful how many large American corporations will beat up on conservatives and then stand silently by while the Chinese communists kill people, kill leaders, run concentration camps and have totalitarian control of the society. It tells you how corrupted so many of these large corporations have become. And it's what they're doing, frankly, is I think is they're eroding any authority they have with the public because the public is going to look at the head of Coca-Cola and say, I got it, you're in the tank for the left and you want to put out whatever your staff writes. \n...\nAnd I think and people learn what's in H.R. 1, they're going to be so angry and that being totally misled and I think President Biden's credibility is in tatters. He reads these things that his staff writes, he has no idea whether or not they're true, and in the case of the Georgia bill, the things that President Biden said are flatly false. And he owes the people of Georgia an apology for having lied about what's going on in Georgia. \nCLICK HERE TO WATCH FULL INTERVIEW",

    "body": "Nonetheless, the bill, which House members are expected to vote on this week, contains significant flaws that are detrimental to the health of our democracy and will likely have unintended consequences on the political rights of noncitizen immigrants as well as many nonprofits, including civil rights organizations and other civil liberties movement builders. The House can and must fix these concerns before final passage.\n\nH.R. 1, in an attempt to find a solution to the problem of \u201cdark money,\u201d requires public disclosure of the names and addresses of donors who give $10,000 or more to organizations that engage in \u201ccampaign-related disbursements,\u201d which could include paid political speech that discusses a public issue such as immigrants\u2019 rights, voting rights or reproductive freedom if the communication merely mentions a candidate for public office. That means an ad criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for supporting immigration reform or criticizing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) for opposing the Equality Act could trigger disclosure of donors that gave $10,000 or more.\n\nWhy should H.R. 1\u2019s sponsors and supporters care? Because it could directly interfere with the ability of many to engage in political speech about causes that they care about and that impact their lives by imposing new and onerous disclosure requirements on nonprofits committed to advancing those causes.\n\nWe know from history that people engaged in politically charged issues become political targets and are often subject to threats of harassment or even violence. This should be gravely concerning in light of the rise in white supremacist violence that has brazenly targeted private citizens and public officials alike. Moreover, in the time of social media, there is heightened interest in who is supporting these efforts.\n\nFor example, many people last year called for an investigation into who was \u201cfunding\u201d Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Louisville, after videos showed a man distributing protest signs and other provisions to protesters. Presumably, the purpose of such an investigation would be to accuse donors supporting the protest of wrongdoing. Indeed, following the wave of racial justice protests over the summer, the Justice Department launched an inquiry into who \u201cfunded\u201d protests, as though opposing police violence was a crime. Those organizations seeking to aggressively advance civil rights and civil liberties through paid communications about issues of public importance should not be deterred from doing so because the government may force public disclosure of their supporters\u2019 identities.\n\nThat is why the Supreme Court, in NAACP v. Alabama, held that \u201cinviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.\u201d In other words, when a group is advocating policy changes outside the mainstream, they need privacy protections to be able to speak freely and without fear of reprisal. H.R. 1 purports to provide an exception for donors that would experience harassment, but it is a flimsy and unworkable protection. If the idea is that organizations are required to prove their members will be harassed, the exception will be ineffectual, under-inclusive and costly to claim.\n\nExposure to threats of harassment or violence for nonprofit donors is not the only First Amendment problem with the bill. H.R. 1 would also expand a prohibition on paid advocacy at the federal, state and local level by \u201cforeign nationals,\u201d which includes, DACA recipients, asylum seekers, temporary protected status holders and many other noncitizens. What is the purpose of inhibiting such people from participating in political speech to advance policies that directly affect their lives? Everyone in this country \u2014 including immigrant communities \u2014 has a stake in our country\u2019s immigration policies, how we distribute pandemic relief, education policy and many other issues.\n\nH.R. 1 can easily be fixed to protect against these infringements on political speech. We hope Congress does the right thing to protect the health of our democracy by fixing these flaws in the bill so that President Biden can sign into law the strongest bill possible.",

Former Federal Election Commission Chair Trevor Potter disagreed in a Feb. 25 letter, citing his credentials at the FEC. However, as a former chair of the FEC, I know that the FEC doesn\u2019t regulate the conduct of elections, as Mr. Potter intimates; it only regulates the financing of political campaigns. It counts the money, not the votes.\n\nH.R.1 is nevertheless troubling for its fundamental changes to the FEC. It would end that agency\u2019s bipartisan structure that prevents either major party from controlling the commission and using its enforcement and rule-making powers to the partisan detriment of candidates of the other party. The FEC\u2019s present statutory structure provides that no more than three members of the six\u2013member commission may be from the same political party, and requires four votes to find violations or promulgate regulations, ensuring bipartisan support for those critical actions.\n\nH.R.1 would change all that by revamping the commission to only five members, with no more than two from any one party but the fifth potentially swing vote ostensibly independent (like Sen. Bernie Sanders is an independent), appointed by the president, and who would likely be ideologically-aligned with the two partisan members of the president\u2019s party to form an effectively partisan majority.\n\nDestruction of the present bipartisan structure of the FEC is one reason that nine former FEC commissioners, including myself, have submitted a letter to Congress opposing H.R. 1.",

It's an issue that she is personally committed to and passionate about,\" Psaki told reporters Wednesday.Biden announced this week that Harris would lead his administration's campaign countering the \"unprecedented assault\" on voting. Republican-governed states have sought to shore up their election security and integrity laws after the 2020 contest's reliance on mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.Some Biden critics, including former Trump White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah, chimed in Tuesday to contend Harris has become Biden's go-to Cabinet member for his toughest, and likely unsolvable, problems.Psaki declined to answer a question about any Harris plans to travel to red states that have passed election laws to which Democrats are opposed, saying she would leave it to the vice president to describe how she will tackle the issue. But her boss's approach offers clues.Part of Biden's response includes lobbying the Senate to pass one or both House bills addressing voting, a seemingly impossible task as 10 Republicans will have to support them unless the chamber's filibuster rules are rolled back.H.R. 1, dubbed the For the People Act, is a far-reaching measure with public financing and automatic voter registration provisions. It cleared the House in March, but West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has not endorsed S.1., H.R. 1's companion legislation in the Senate. He has said he would support the John Lewis Voting Rights Enhancement Act, or H.R. 4. That proposal restores Justice Department pre-clearance requirements for states with a history of restricting ballot access.Harris's new role adds to her growing list of responsibilities as Biden's No. 2 \u2014 and potential presidential candidate in 2024 or 2028. Her portfolio already includes tackling the root causes of illegal migration across the southern border from the Northern Triangle, improving broadband access, championing small business, and heading the National Space Council.Psaki described Harris Wednesday as \"an important partner\" and \"somebody who can work to take on challenging and hard initiatives.\"\"He's confident in her ability to take on a robust agenda, which she certainly has on her plate,\" she said of Biden.Shortly after Biden's announcement in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Harris released a statement welcoming the role as \"the work of democracy.\"",

    "body": "On Wednesday, Democrats leading the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on H.R. 40, a bill that has been introduced routinely over the past 30 years to authorize a study on potential reparations for Black Americans impacted by slavery. The hearing, titled \u201cExploring the Pathway to Reparative Justice in America,\u201d was timely, as its fundamental question about the value of Black life in America is more fraught now than during any period in modern history. Last month, violent rioters \u2015 several of them pictured with Confederate flags and others who erected a gallows on the National Mall \u2015 carried out a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Electoral College votes, a number of which hinged on voters in predominantly Black districts. Days after the Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting that violence, the House's hearing on reparations for Black American suffering felt like a rebuttal. H.R. 40 was introduced by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Texas), who became the bill's sponsor after the late Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) resigned in 2017. The bill authorizes Congress to establish a commission that \u201cshall examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.\u201d More than 170 representatives have signed on as co-sponsors. Rep. Jackson Lee, who has supported H.R. 40 in the past, said the Jan. 6 insurrection proves America still needs to reckon with its oppressive past. The rioters who stormed the Capitol \u201cbrandished symbols of division and intolerance that echo back to the darkest periods of our nation's history,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly, we require a reckoning to restore national balance and unity.\u201d \u201cThis moment of national reckoning comes at a time when our nation must find constructive ways to confront the rising tide of racial and ethnic division,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerry Nadler said. \u201cOn January 6, we saw the ugly confluence of such divisions as white nationalist groups appeared to be among those playing a central role in the violent assault on the United States Capitol.\u201d Nadler said reparations are about \u201crespect and reconciliation.\u201d During the hearing, Democrats and their witnesses clarified that H.R. 40 doesn't specify the particular form reparations for African Americans would take. Republican witnesses \u2015 including Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, conservative pundit Larry Elder and former running back Herschel Walker \u2015 dismissed the bill by either rejecting the need for reparations entirely or rejecting the premise of direct compensatory payments. Elder and Walker are popular figures in conservative media who have gained prominence for criticizing antiracist activists Owens, who said his great-great-grandfather arrived in the U.S. \u201cin the belly of a slave ship,\u201d said \u201creparations is not the way to right our country's wrong.\u201d \u201cIt is impractical and a non-starter for the United States government to pay reparations,\u201d Rep. Owens claimed. \u201cIt is also unfair and heartless to give Black Americans the hope that this is a reality.\u201d In several cases, witnesses for House Democrats rebutted Republicans' argument by describing historical instances when the U.S. and governments around the world paid reparations to oppressed ethnic groups. One of them, Kathy Masaoka, co-chairs a California-based advocacy group that seeks reparative justice for Japanese Americans harmed by the U.S. government's racist forced removal and incarceration of their families during World War II. Her organization, Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress (\u201cNikkei\u201d is a word referring to people of Japanese ancestry), helped the successful push for Japanese American reparations in 1988. With the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, Congress authorized $20,000 for the surviving victims of incarceration, and the United States formally acknowledged \u201ca grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II.\u201d Masaoka said her organization supports H.R. 40 and reparations for African Americans because \u201cOne: It is the right thing to do. Two: It is long overdue. And three: Because we know it is possible,\u201d she said. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber also joined as a witness in support of H.R. 40, arguing that her state is modeling a way for governments to investigate and offer reparative justice to African Americans harmed by slavery. Weber, the first African American secretary of state in California history, touted Assembly Bill 3121 , a California law authorizing a state task force to \u201cstudy and develop reparation proposals for African Americans.\u201d Weber said the California bill doesn't excuse the federal government from assessing its role in racist oppression, but she said the state's approach to reparations should take hold across the country. In California, \u201cwe need not ask whether or not slavery has had an impact, but instead illuminate the extent to which it has had an impact,\u201d she said.",

    "body": "Rep. James Comer says the vote is a political power grab and a way to end the filibuster and pass liberal legislation. \n\n\n\n\nWe are witnessing a radical transformational push by the Left to bend and warp America\u2019s institutions and government to their will. This week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0plans to ram the next phase of Democrats\u2019 strategy through the House: granting statehood to the District of Columbia.\nThis is a political power play, plain and simple.\nH.R. 51,\u00a0the Washington, D.C., Admission Act, would admit the District of Columbia to the United States as the 51st\u00a0state, to be called \"Washington, Douglass Commonwealth.\" There are\u00a0a host of fundamental problems with both the approach and policy of this bill introduced by D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton.\nLIZ PEEK: BIDEN'S WEAK POLL NUMBERS\u00a0\u2013 HERE'S WHY MANY AMERICANS UNHAPPY WITH PRESIDENT, RADICAL POLICIES\nEager to solidify their narrow control in Congress to force through their radical agenda, Democrats are happy to disregard the wisdom and intent of our Founding Fathers. Let\u2019s remember, there\u2019s a reason the District of Columbia exists as a special federal enclave and holds a unique status in our system of government as created by the Constitution.\nAs James Madison argued in\u00a0Federalist Paper\u00a0No. 43, if America\u2019s capital were situated in any state, that state would wield tremendous influence over the federal government. The Constitution was explicitly crafted to avoid this by carving out a federal district in which to seat the capital on neutral ground.\nH.R. 51 ignores the smart and still valid reasoning that created the district over two centuries ago.\nFurthermore, H.R. 51 is blatantly unconstitutional. By itself, Congress cannot grant statehood to the District of Columbia. Despite what you may hear from Democrats this week, it\u2019s not that simple.\nWhile states have historically been admitted to the union by acts of Congress, the Constitution explicitly discusses the district several times and grants the city special privileges \u2013 all of which need to be addressed by a constitutional amendment. This is a longstanding and bipartisan view.\nIn 1963, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, a Democrat, said D.C. statehood would be \"inconceivable\" without amending the Constitution, and every Justice Department has since agreed. Yet, H.R. 51 makes no serious attempt to resolve this fundamental roadblock.\nGiven that the approach is so obviously unworkable, why are Democrats so doggedly pursuing statehood through H.R. 51?\nIf Democrats honestly care only about providing full representation, there are less problematic\u00a0alternatives that could win bipartisan support.\nLegitimately granting statehood to D.C. requires a constitutional amendment \u2013 which is both immensely difficult and highly unlikely. Recall that there are two ways to propose a change to the Constitution: two-thirds of both chambers of Congress can vote on it, or two-thirds of state legislatures can vote to ask Congress to call a national convention.\nOnce proposed, ratifying an amendment requires approval from three-fourths of the states, either by the states\u2019 legislatures or in the national convention. With such a high bar, any amendment to the Constitution requires broad support across the nation.\nHere we arrive at the fundamental problem that H.R. 51 tries to slip around. Most Americans do not support granting statehood to the District of Columbia. The exact percentage varies from\u00a0poll\u00a0to\u00a0poll,\u00a0but a majority of Americans consistently oppose statehood.\nWhy are Democrats pursuing this at all?\nDemocrats claim their aim is simply to give the district\u2019s residents voting representation. But it\u2019s entirely false that the district has no representation. While it\u2019s true that the district does not have a voice in the Senate, it does have a delegate in the House\u00a0and three electoral votes in presidential elections \u2013 something no other city in the country enjoys.\nHowever, if Democrats honestly care only about providing full representation, there are less problematic\u00a0alternatives that could win bipartisan support.\nOne such compromise is to cede the residential portions of the district back to Maryland, just as Arlington and Alexandria were ceded back to Virginia in 1846. Democrats have flatly rejected that idea.\nI offered a similar compromise when the House Committee on Oversight and Reform considered H.R. 51 on April 14. I proposed an amendment to allow dresidents to vote in federal elections in Maryland \u2013 an arrangement that dates back to the period shortly after the Constitution was ratified.\nIn turn, Maryland would temporarily receive an additional House seat until the next congressional reapportionment following the 2030 census, a reasonable compromise. The District would remain\u00a0neutral ground for America\u2019s government, and the district\u2019s residents would have voices with full voting power in both chambers of Congress. Democrats refused to support my amendment.\nWhy would Democrats so stubbornly reject any compromise that gives voting representation to district residents?\nBecause, truthfully, it\u2019s not about voting representation. It\u2019s about the balance of power in Congress itself.\nLike all states, the proposed \"Washington, Douglass Commonwealth\" would have two seats in the U.S. Senate \u2013 and Democrats know which party will win those seats.\nIn 2020, Joe Biden received 92.1%\u00a0of the vote in D.C., and that\u2019s no anomaly. No Republican presidential candidate has received more than 10%\u00a0of the district\u2019s vote since 1988. The state of \"Washington, Douglass Commonwealth\" would be the most liberal state in America, making California look like Texas by comparison!\nRight now, Democrats\u2019\u00a0grip on power in the Senate is so tenuous that they rely on Vice President Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes. Two additional Senate Democrats would be a tremendous advantage in preserving their majority, and that\u2019s what this comes down to at the end of the day.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nAs the House debates H.R. 51 this week, don\u2019t be fooled by claims from Democrats. There\u2019s only one real motive here. They need more votes in the Senate to pass their radical agenda to appease their base \u2013 the socialists and Marxists, the Black Lives Matter and #DefundThePolice movements, climate change extremists, union bosses, social justice warriors, and so on.\nJust as they now aim to expand the Supreme Court to tilt it in their favor, Democrats also want to expand the Senate to cement their majority.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

H.R. 5746, an unrelated NASA bill and the legislative vehicle for two voting rights bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly voted for cloture, while Republicans voted in lockstep against the motion.

Joe Manchin praised a Tuesday morning meeting with civil rights leaders, calling it \"constructive\" and \"informative,\" but maintained his opposition to a sweeping set of election overhaul measures known as the For the People Act. \n   \"I don't think anybody changed positions on that. We're just learning where everybody's coming from,\" the West Virginia Democrat told Capitol Hill reporters after the meeting, which included the heads of the National Urban League, the NAACP, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and others.\n   The meeting came two days after Manchin announced in an op-ed for the Charleston Gazette-Mail that he wouldn't support the elections reform and voting rights bill, citing a lack of bipartisanship.\n   \"Congressional action on federal voting rights legislation must be the result of both Democrats and Republicans coming together to find a pathway forward or we risk further dividing and destroying the republic we swore to protect and defend as elected officials,\" he wrote. \n   Manchin's opposition is seen as a death knell for the legislation, which every other Democratic senator is co-sponsoring and which Democrats argue is the necessary remedy to efforts by Republican-led states to pass restrictive election laws. \n      Despite Manchin's steadfast stance on the legislation, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the meeting \"productive\" and said he believes Manchin is someone \"committed to making democracy work.\" \n   \"Our goal was to establish and build the relationship [with Manchin] and we accomplished that,\" he told NPR. \"Now the real work starts because the commitment from the senator and from us is that we would maintain the dialogue and work as hard as possible to come up with a solution that can actually become policy.\" \n   He added: \"The work of the NAACP in this moment is around the outcome to protect the rights of voters and one meeting won't solve that.\"\n   Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, also said it was a good first meeting. \n   \"[Manchin] was very much in a listening mode. He shared his viewpoints,\" she told NPR. \"He seemed to really have a deep concern that our democracy is really at a crossroads.\"\n   Campbell said she discussed in the meeting how the filibuster has historically been used to block civil rights legislation. \n   \"And here we are in 2021 with a Senate...that could actually stop the ability to make voting rights reform when we are having an all-out assault on voting rights all over this country.\" \n      Since Democrats hold the thinnest of majorities in the Senate, they either need 10 Republicans to join them in supporting the legislation, which is extremely unlikely, or they need to eliminate the filibuster and allow the bill to advance with a simple majority, something Manchin has repeatedly said he opposes.  \n   Speaking with CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Manchin said he wants to work to get Republicans on board with passing a voting rights bill. \n   \"I'm going to fight for this and I think the Republicans will fight for this and understand we must come together on a voting rights bill in a bipartisan way,\" he said.\n   Manchin supports H.R. 4, also known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n   But that measure is also unlikely to get support from 10 Republican senators. \n   Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday the voting rights legislation is intact and that the Supreme Court only struck down a piece on pre-clearance because it decided the conditions had changed since the law was passed. \n   \"So there's no threat to the Voting Rights Law, it's against the law to discriminate in the voting on the basis of race already and so I think [the Lewis bill] is unnecessary,\" he told reporters. \n   Johnson commended Manchin for his support of H.R. 4 but said it's not encompassing of everything that he believes is needed. \n   \"That piece of legislation is important as you look forward, but there's some recent activity that we also have to address by states like Georgia and several other jurisdictions so that individuals have access to voting free and clear from voter suppression methods,\" he said. \n   Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters Tuesday morning that \"it's not an either or proposition\" between the two pieces of legislation. \n   \"I'm glad that we have the John Lewis bill, appropriately named in his honor,\" he said. \"But let's be clear, John Lewis spent his last 10 years fighting for the provisions of the For the People Act, because he understood that over the last decade, we've seen an assault on voting rights across our country that sought to roll back the very protections that he fought for.\" \n   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues Tuesday that H.R. 4 won't be ready until the fall and shouldn't be considered a \"substitute\" for H.R.1. \n   \"Congressman John Lewis wrote 300 pages of H.R. 1 to end voter suppression,\" she wrote. \"It would be our hope to have this pass the House and Senate in a bipartisan way.\"\n   Democrats plan to hold a vote on the measure later this month, even though it's expected to fail.",

Meanwhile, it mails out live ballots to everyone on the voting list \u2014 alive or dead \u2014 and it makes it much more difficult for states to take dead people off the voting rolls, to take people who moved away off of voting rolls.\u201d\n\nRokita noted that H.R. 1, named the For the People Act, would also nationalize legalize ballot harvesting and extend voting deadlines for ten days after an election.\n\n\u201c[H.R. 1] says you can still turn in that mailed-out ballot \u2014 or your ballot harvester can, the third party that\u2019s going around collecting them \u2014 up to ten days after the election. So if you get a close election, you can still have harvesters out there collecting \u2014 possibly, likely \u2014 fraudulent ballots and turning them in because you really don\u2019t have to do anything, and you have to accept these ballots.\u201d\n\nMarlow assessed, \u201cThere\u2019s no sane Western country that does this, is there?\u201d\n\nRokita replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no same third-world country that does this. Everywhere you go in the world, a photo ID is required [to vote]. Everywhere you go in the world, it\u2019s by vast majority in-person voting because that\u2019s how you really can help maintain one-person-one-vote because the person actually appears before you. We\u2019ve had reasonable exceptions in this country, like if you\u2019re invalid, you can\u2019t get to a polling place, [or] even if you planned to be outside the jurisdiction on the election day, you can attest to that fact and get an absentee ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cMail-in balloting is where the most fraud occurs, and now they\u2019ve thrown out those thin guard rails,\u201d Rokita added. He\u00a0highlighted the Constitution\u2019s decentralized framework for national elections.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that you can count on and why our Constitution is so brilliant is that it preserves that one-person-one-vote, at least to the states, the idea of how they\u2019re going to do the time, manner, and place of an election, not some central government,\u201d Rokita remarked.\n\nRokita concluded, \u201cIf the people don\u2019t think and don\u2019t have reasonable confidence backed by facts and observation that they still are in power \u2014 that they have the power through the electoral process to put in place who they want \u2014 then this country is lost.\u201d\n\nRokita joined 19 other state attorneys general in a letter to congressional leaders laying out \u201cconstitutional vulnerabilities\u201d within H.R. 1.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.",

    "body": "The debate over whether Black Americans should receive compensation to make up for America\u2019s racist past reignited at a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, with advocates saying reparations would put the U.S. on a path to \u201crestorative justice\u201d and opponents dubbing the idea \u201cimpractical.\u201d\n\nPeople on both sides of the reparations debate testified during a virtual House subcommittee hearing on H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study and propose reparations for African-Americans in light of slavery and historical discrimination.\n\nSupporters say the long-proposed bill has new urgency and momentum because of last year\u2019s police-brutality protests, the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on Black Americans, and the presence of hate groups at the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, the facts and circumstances facing our nation demonstrate the importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of placing our nation on the path to reparative justice,\u201d the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas), said during the hearing held by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\n\nJackson Lee last month reintroduced House bill H.R. 40, which would establish a $12 million commission to study the history of slavery in the colonies and United States, the federal and state governments\u2019 role in supporting slavery, and discrimination against freed slaves and their descendants. The 13-member commission would also recommend \u201cappropriate remedies.\u201d\n\nBefore Jackson Lee took up the bill\u2019s mantle, the late Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.) had repeatedly reintroduced the legislation since 1989. The name H.R. 40 is a reference to \u201c40 acres and a mule,\u201d the unfulfilled land-grant promise made to formerly enslaved people after the Civil War.\n\nThe congresswoman, who submitted pictures of lynchings and brutalizations of Black Americans to be entered into the record, noted during the hearing that this would be \u201can active commission.\u201d \u201cIt is to study, but it is also to develop reparation proposals,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the bill does not draw any conclusion about how to properly atone for the legacy of slavery, nor does it mandate financial payments or \u201cprejudge the outcome of the commission\u2019s work,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) added.\n\n\u201cInstead, it sets forth a process by which a diverse group of experts and stakeholders can study the complex issues involved and make recommendations,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cIn fact, most serious reparations models that have been proposed to date have focused on reparative community-based programs of employment, healthcare, housing and educational initiatives \u2014 righting wrongs that cannot be fixed with checks alone.\u201d\n\nRep. Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and newly elected Utah Republican who testified against H.R. 40 in a 2019 hearing and served as the ranking member on the subcommittee Wednesday, noted that his great-great-grandfather Silas \u201carrived here in the belly of a slave ship.\u201d But reparations are \u201cnot the way to right our country\u2019s wrong,\u201d he argued, calling the idea \u201cimpractical and a nonstarter.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing included testimony from California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, UCLA School of Law professor E. Tendayi Achiume, former NFL player Herschel Walker, attorney and conservative radio host Larry Elder, Human Rights Watch racial-justice researcher Dreisen Heath, Nikkei for Civil Rights & Redress co-chair Kathy Masaoka, and National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America national male co-chair Kamm Howard.\n\nHeath argued that \u201cif racial justice is ever to be achieved, \u2018repair\u2019 needs to be part of the equation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concept of reparations is well established in international human-rights law. At its core is the idea that economic and social conditions cannot improve without addressing and repairing harm,\u201d Heath said. \u201cThe U.S. has never fully or properly reckoned with the gross human-rights violation of chattel slavery and the post-emancipation racist policies that continue to impact Black people in the U.S. today.\u201d\n\nAnd Achiume, an expert in international human-rights law, added that while popular conceptions of reparations tended to be relatively narrow and focus only on financial compensation, the international system emphasizes a more comprehensive approach that may also include transforming political, economic and social institutions.\n\n\u201cReparations for slavery are an integral part of fulfilling the international legal mandate to eliminate racial discrimination,\u201d Achiume added. \u201cThe United States is not exempt from these responsibilities, and H.R. 40 would represent important progress in fulfilling its obligations under international law.\u201d\n\nWeber, who was sworn in last month as California\u2019s first Black secretary of state, spoke of her efforts spearheading a state law as a California assemblywoman to establish a task force to study the issue of reparations for descendants of enslaved people. That effort, she said, should not preclude the potential for reparations at the federal level.\n\n\u201cOut of all due respect, Californians can no longer wait for the national government to do its job,\u201d Weber said. \u201cWe believe that we must do what is necessary for Californians and be an example of what can happen in this nation when there is serious discussion and research done on African Americans and the impact of slavery.\u201d\n\nMasaoka, meanwhile, wove together Japanese Americans\u2019 and Black Americans\u2019 respective fights for reparations\u00a0and reiterated her organization\u2019s support for H.R. 40. Japanese Americans won reparations from the U.S. government in 1988 for their incarceration during World War II.\n\n\u201cIt was important for Japanese Americans to determine our own path toward redress and reparations, and we fully stand behind the Black community as they determine their own path forward,\u201d she said. Reparations for Black Americans are \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d and \u201clong overdue,\u201d she added.\n\nBut Walker, a prominent supporter of former President Donald Trump who spoke at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention, raised questions about how reparations would play out in practice.\n\n\u201cWhere would the money come from? Does it come from all the other races except the Black taxpayers?\u201d he said. \u201cWho is Black? What percent of Black must you be to receive reparations? Do you go to 23 and Me or a DNA test to determine the percentage of Blackness?\u201d\n\nAnd Elder, who also opposes reparations, said he found it \u201cironic\u201d that this conversation was taking place 13 years after the country elected its first Black president. \u201cReparations is the extraction of money from people who were never slave owners to be given to people who were never slaves,\u201d he added in a statement released ahead of the hearing.\n\nH.R. 40 was previously the subject of a June 19, 2019 congressional hearing that included testimony from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, actor Danny Glover and Sen. Cory Booker (D, N.J.), who also introduced a Senate companion bill.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), said in 2019 he believed reparations aren\u2019t a \u201cgood idea\u201d and that \u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black GOP senator, also rejected the idea: \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations help level the playing field \u2014 it might help more eruptions on the playing field,\u201d he said last year.\n\nUltimately, almost every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate threw their support behind the idea of studying potential reparations proposals. President Joe Biden said during the campaign that his administration would support a study of reparations, but he has not specifically backed H.R. 40.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Wednesday that Biden supports studying reparations. \u201cAnd he continues to demonstrate his commitment to take comprehensive action to address the systemic racism that persists today,\u201d Psaki added, pointing to an executive order Biden signed on his first day in office to address racial equity.\n\nSmaller efforts to consider reparations have also arisen in recent years. Schools like Georgetown University, for example, have examined their legacies of slavery and sought to compensate descendants of enslaved people through various means. The Evanston, Ill., city council has also committed to putting tax revenue from recreational cannabis sales toward reparations, and the city council in Asheville, N.C. approved a resolution last July supporting \u201ccommunity reparations\u201d for Black residents.",

    "body": "life science investors and biotech CEOs joined together with a prominent patient advocate to speak out against H.R.3, known as the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. The panel was hosted by life sciences venture capital coalition Incubate and held at the National Press Club. The panelists warned that if lawmakers impose price controls in the pharmaceutical market, investment in biomedical research will plummet to near zero. \"If price controls are enacted, the life sciences investment equation will no longer justify investment in R&D\" opened John Stanford, Incubate's executive director. \"Investment won't just be reduced. It will drop off a cliff.\" Panelists expanded on Stanford's sentiments, highlighting the critical role of venture capital in the development of life-saving drugs and how rapidly that funding would evaporate in the presence of price controls. \"If the government can pick any arbitrarily low price it wants, and prevent a company from saying 'no' by threatening it with a ruinous 95% tax, then I could not justify any biomedical R&D investment to my investors,' said Peter Kolchinsky, Ph.D., founder and managing partner at RA Capital. \"In other words, we should expect a near total collapse of R&D funding.\" \"More than 50% of FDA-approved medicines now have their start in venture-backed private biotech companies in the United States. These are the groundbreaking treatments for cancer, genetic diseases, and other scourges,\" said Arjun Goyal, M.D., co-founder and managing director at Vida Ventures. \"But they'll disappear if Congress passes these price controls. Ultimately patients will lose out, both here in the United States and globally.\" \"Price controls would upend these critical incentives and make it fundamentally impossible for investors to secure a return, causing them to flee the sector,\" said Axel Hoos, M.D., CEO of Scorpion Therapeutics. \"I spearhead a group of in-house counsel at life sciences investment firms, numbering about 80 members,\" said Sarah Reed, general counsel at RA Capital. \"And we are discussing the drafting of what will have to be an escape hatch, allowing firms like ours to cease investing more money and to pull back the money they have already funded, if H.R.3 is passed in anything close to its current form.\" Speakers also noted how the policy would impact the country's economy, global standing, and the patient experience. \"This will affect private and public companies of all sizes, jobs will be lost, and U.S. biopharmaceutical leadership will be impaired,\" said Jean-Francois Formela, M.D., partner at Atlas Ventures. \"Patients will ultimately suffer the most when potential breakthrough therapies and cures are no longer invented.\" \"If H.R.3 passes, our critical funding from venture capitalists will dry up, along with our potential to develop urgently needed new treatment options,\" said Joanne Kotz, Ph.D., co-founder, president, and CEO of Jnana Therapeutics. \"We will all lose hope of having better medicines tomorrow than we have today. We'll face suffering that our research could have averted. That's just senseless.\" Finally, attendees heard from a speaker with a deeply personal stake in the policy debate. \"I'm alive today precisely because of the market opportunity present in drug discovery and development,\" said Gunnar Esiason, a cystic fibrosis and rare disease patient advocate. \"For the better part of my early twenties, I was teetering on the brink of end stage illness. The thing that got me through my worst days -- when I was bouncing in and out of the hospital -- was the idea that somebody, somewhere, was working on something for me. The idea that there could be innovations we have not even thought of yet, affords patients like myself a great deal of hope. But if H.R.3 is passed, we will sacrifice the structure that makes future cures a reality.\" About Incubate Incubate is a 501(c)(4) organization of venture capital organizations representing the patient, corporate, and investment communities. Our primary aim is to educate policymakers on the role of venture in bringing promising ideas to patients in need.

    "body": "A trio of key Democrats announced Tuesday they will oppose the party's plan to lower drug prices, creating a significant roadblock for Democrats' desired $3.5 trillion tax and spending package. Reps. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) said they will oppose drug-pricing changes that would allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices and that have become the framework to pay for many of Democrats' sought-after reforms this year. The three lawmakers are members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of several committees debating the budget reconciliation package, and say they have concerns about a plan to empower Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies. The drug-pricing changes are widely regarded as a linchpin to a broader set of health-care changes that Democrats hope to accomplish, with the savings on federal pharmaceutical spending helping to pay for the rest. The pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have staunchly opposed the drug-price plan and argued it will hurt the industry's ability to develop drugs \u2014 an argument echoed Tuesday by the Democratic holdouts. \u201cI support many of the proposals being considered this week, but I do not support advancing policies that are not fiscally responsible and jeopardize the bill's final passage,\u201d Rice said in a statement. \u201cI want to be clear \u2014 I support Medicare drug price negotiations,\u201d Schrader said in a statement on Tuesday, but he introduced a rival proposal that would limit Medicare's power to negotiate to \u201cthe most expensive subset of drugs on the market.\u201d Patient advocates and most congressional Democrats have argued that allowing Medicare \u2014 the national health insurance program for older Americans \u2014 to use its bargaining power would drive down U.S. drug prices. While Democrats' drug-pricing plan can still advance to a floor vote in the House, the three members' opposition puts the broader reconciliation package at risk and may force leaders to compromise on its provisions. Democrats cannot lose another vote for the drug-price plan if it is to be included in their massive social spending package, known as the Build Back Better Act, and other centrist members of the party have signaled they have their own sets of concerns. House Democrats have pinned their reconciliation strategy on enacting reforms contained in legislation passed by the House in 2019 called H.R. 3; that legislation died in the Senate. The Democrats cite Congressional Budget Office projections that the bill's drug-negotiation provisions would lower drug prices and cut federal spending by $456 billion over a decade. Those savings could then be used to broaden the social safety net, such as offering additional Medicare benefits and allowing more people to enroll in Medicaid, the government's health insurance program for low-income Americans, party leaders argue. H.R. 3 \u201ccalled for using savings from the negotiation for prescription drug prices \u2014 the savings from that to be used for expanding dental, visual and hearing benefits for seniors,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last week. \u201cWe're all for that.\u201d On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is hashing out a drug-price negotiation plan of his own \u2014 and also must try to thread a needle between the moderate and liberal wings of his caucus. While H.R. 3 passed the House in a 230 to 192 vote in December 2019, Democrats have since lost seats in the chamber and can afford only three defections in the House and none in the Senate to pass the Build Back Better Act. Republicans have been unified in their opposition to the reconciliation plan, which can pass with a simple majority in both chambers. Democrats have sought to tamp down perceptions of infighting as their reconciliation package proceeds. \u201cDemocrats are committed to leveling the playing field and reining in the soaring cost of prescription drug prices for the American people,\u201d said C.J. Young, a spokesman for the Energy and Commerce Committee. Congressional aides noted that the House Ways and Means Committee can still advance the drug-price plan for a floor vote, even if the measure stalls in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Advocacy groups have pressed Democrats to remain in lockstep on the drug-pricing provisions. Patients for Affordable Drugs Now this summer targeted Peters and Schrader in ads, exhorting them to support H.R. 3 after they raised concerns about the legislation, and on Tuesday released new polling data commissioned by the organization that showed strong support for drug-price negotiations in the three holdout lawmakers' districts. Advocates also castigated the pharmaceutical industry Tuesday, suggesting the deep-pocketed sector had helped fuel some Democrats' resistance to drug-pricing reforms. \u201cThis is David and Goliath. The drug companies are one of the wealthiest industries in the world. They spend more lobbying than any other industry,\u201d said Frederick Isasi, executive director of Families USA, a liberal consumer health lobby. Pharmaceutical industry officials argued that lawmakers such as Peters \u2014 who voted for H.R. 3 in 2019 \u2014 have independently reconsidered the plan after Democrats secured unified control of Congress and the White House and Washington's political realities shifted.

It prohibits President Joe Biden from banning fracking, and eliminates all restrictions on the import and export of natural gas. It also uses the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of Biden\u2019s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline project.\n\nThe bill, which is not expected to pass the Senate, also includes provisions supported in the 117th Congress by Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Manchin\u2019s Energy Independence and Security Act included amendments to the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act that would have required regulators to approve or reject projects within one year of application for environmental assessments and two years for environmental impact statements.

Gimenez has become 'Persona Non Grata' in the 26th Congressional District due to his Socialist voting record.\n\nAmerica First will make a formal endorsement in the near future of a Conservative Republican Candidate to Primary Gimenez in the August 23, 2022 election. Gimenez is supported by America First, Donald Trump or the Republican Party.\n\nCarlos Gimenez has voted with Nancy Pelosi and the radical leftists. Gimenez also defended disgraced Liz Cheney\u00a0after she voted in favor of the 'Sham Impeachment'\u00a0against Donald Trump. Gimenez doubled down in defending Cheney\u00a0after the Republican Caucus censored and removed Liz Cheney from Republican\u00a0Party\u00a0Leadership.\n\nGimenez also voted for the 'January 6' Socialist Democrat witch hunt against American Citizens and Republican voters. Gimenez, like Liz Cheney openly votes and sides with the Socialist Democrats.\n\nSome other notable examples of Gimenez Socialist votes include:\n\nin 2016. That alone was grounds for expulsion from the GOP;\n\non H.R. 550, to allow the federal government to create a database, track unvaccinated Americans, who could be targeted, segregated, discriminated against, and forced to comply with vaccination mandates;\n\non Anti-Second Amendment legislation HR-8, making it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to purchase, own, carry, and use a firearm;\n\non H.R. 6 for 'Open Borders and Amnesty'\u00a0to over 20 million criminal illegal aliens, which would permanently avoid deportation, obtain a pathway to citizenship, and full voting rights;\n\nto strip Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of all Congressional Committee positions.\n\nOur mission is to protect the integrity of the U.S. Constitution, promote conservative political candidates and policy that puts\u00a0America First.\n\nIs there a problem with this press release?

    "body": "Big city mayors from across the country are again calling on Uncle Sam to address a problem they are unwilling to tackle \u2013 in this case, violent crime in cities under their control. This week, some six dozen mayors belonging to the United States Conference of Mayors sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Schumer and Senate Minority Leader McConnell, demanding that the \u201clame duck\u201d session of the Senate pass two pieces of extreme gun control legislation that were adopted by the House in early 2021.\nThe mayors, of course, do not refer to the bills \u2013 H.R. 1808 and H.R. 8 \u2013 as \u201cgun control\u201d legislation; that would be too honest. For them, the measures, which would dramatically restrict the type of firearms that can be lawfully owned and sold, are \u201cgun safety\u201d measures. In these mayors\u2019 pinched view of the Second Amendment, such limitations do \u201cnot in any way infringe on Second Amendment rights\u201d; in much the same way that to others, restricting what books one might read would \u201cnot in any way infringe on First Amendment rights.\u201d\u00a0\n Such hypocrisy aside, the two \u201cgun safety\u201d bills which passed the House almost completely along party lines, have nothing whatsoever to do with the \u201csafety\u201d of firearms, and everything to do with outlawing certain firearms and firearms accessories. The legislation also mandates that virtually every transfer of a firearm, including between private individuals, be run through the FBI database known as the National Instant Check System or \u201cNICS.\u201d\n Both H.R. 8 and H.R. 1808 are purposefully convoluted, drafted in such way so as to confuse all but the most expert firearms lawyers and Federal Firearms Licensees. In essence, H.R. 8 purports to plug the so-called \u201cgun show loophole\u201d over which Democrats have obsessed for decades, while H.R. 1808 resurrects the 1994 \u201cClinton gun ban\u201d (which sun-setted a decade later without resulting in any measurable benefit for preventing gun violence).\n Among the mayors who signed the missive to Sens. Schumer and McConnell are the usual suspects \u2013 big city Democrat mayors who preside over serious violent crime sprees in their jurisdictions. Included among the signees are the chief executives of such crime-ridden cities as Baltimore, Chicago, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Portland (Oregon) \u2014 all are big cities with extremely high incidents of gun deaths.\n  It is, of course, far easier to clamor for federal gun control (whatever you call it) and demand congressional action, than it is to take measures such as tougher policing and prosecutions that are among the responsibilities of big-city mayors. Hence the calls for the Senate to act.\n Calling on Congress to pass gun control legislation is becoming a tired refrain from the U.S. Conference of Mayors. This week\u2019s letter to Schumer and McConnell, for example, mirrors ones sent back in 2019. The difference this time around, of course, is the fact that both houses of Congress are in lame duck session. It is during such times that legislation which otherwise would stand little chance of passage can be pushed through.\u00a0\n Still, with this lame duck session facing an already crowded calendar of \u201cmust pass\u201d spending measures and highly controversial measures such as a national pro-abortion bill, mustering the votes necessary to overcome the 60-vote filibuster majority for another extremely controversial measure as gun control, will likely be more than the Senate leadership is willing to take on.\n Complicating the scenario, however, is the fact that when the 118th Congress convenes in early January, it will be with a Republican House majority that will almost certainly not pass gun control measures such as were adopted by the House in 2021 and which now await Senate action. This increases the pressure on Schumer to twist as many arms as possible, including moderate GOP members, and make deals he might not otherwise entertain, in an effort to ram through some form of gun control that could then be sent back to the House before it, too, adjourns sine die later this month.\n \n The bottom line in this politically charged environment is that while major, high profile gun control legislation is unlikely to pass the Senate during this lame duck session, Second Amendment supporters had best watch out for \u201csmaller\u201d anti-gun measures to sneak through before the ball drops on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0\n Bob Barr represented Georgia\u2019s Seventh District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003.

    "body": "A new poll set to be released Wednesday by Rasmussen Reports indicates that 75% of Americans support voter ID laws that require voters to show photo identification before voting \u2014 including 60% of Democrats. Only 21% oppose such laws.\n\nDemocrats are currently pursuing federal legislation to override state voter ID laws. H.R. 1, the so-called \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d has already passed the Democrat-controlled House and will soon be introduced in the Senate.\n\nMany Democrats are calling for the filibuster to eliminated or reformed so that H.R. 1 can pass by a simple majority vote, ending voter ID.\n\nAs the U.S. Senate considers legislation that would revamp America\u2019s election laws, voters still overwhelmingly support laws requiring that voters show identification before casting a ballot. Seventy-five percent (75%) of Likely U.S. Voters believe voters should be required to show photo identification such as a driver\u2019s license before being allowed to vote. Only 21% are opposed to such a requirement. Thirty-six states have enacted some form of voter ID law, but those laws would be nullified if the Senate approves H.R. 1, which passed the House on a party-line vote. Critics say H.R. 1 \u201cwould force states to allow anyone to vote who simply signs a form saying that they are who they claim they are.\u201d Support for voter ID laws has actually increased since 2018, when 67% said voters should be required to show photo identification such as a driver\u2019s license before being allowed to vote. Eighty-nine percent (89%) of Republicans support voter ID requirements, as do 60% of Democrats and 77% of voters not affiliated with either major party.\n\nPreliminary cross-tabs shared with Breitbart News show that black voters also favor voter ID, 69% to 25%, and were evenly split (43% to 43%) on the question of whether voter ID is discriminatory. (51% of Democrats as a whole said that it was, as did 59% of self-identified liberals; 60% of overall voters said that it was not, versus 31% who said that it was.)\n\nVoter ID is standard in much of the rest of the world \u2014 including poor, war-torn regions such as Uganda and Iraq, below.\n\nDemocrats, such as Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL), the number two-ranked member of his caucus, said Monday that the filibuster needed to be reformed because it is \u201cbeing misused by some Senators to block legislation urgently needed and supported by strong majorities of the American people.\u201d\n\nHowever, a strong majority opposes parts of H.R. 1. \u2014 at least the voter ID provisions, which contradict the preferences of three out of four likely U.S. voters, according to Rasmussen.\n\nH.R. 1 says states \u201cmay not require an individual to provide any form of identification as a condition of obtaining an absentee ballot\u201d and lets voters to use a \u201csworn written statement\u201d rather than photo ID, which it calls a restriction on the right to vote.\n\nJoel B.

According to the bill, \u201ca State may not refuse to treat an individual as an eligible individual \u2026 on the grounds that the individual is less than 18 years of age \u2026 so long as the individual is at least 16 years of age at such time.\u201d Although the bill does not require states to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in elections, the states must automatically register them. (RELATED: 125 Democrats And 1 Republican Vote To Lower Voting Age To 16)\n   Ending voter ID requirements\u00a0\n Voters would no longer be required to show an ID when voting under H.R. 1. States also cannot require identification for obtaining an absentee ballot or casting a mail-in ballot \u2013 including notary stamps or witness signatures, which are safeguards currently in place. This provision would change laws in the 36 states which require or request some form of identification at the polls.\n   \n Legalizing ballot harvesting\n Ballot harvesting, a practice where a third party collects ballots for voters and delivers them to an eligible drop-off location, would be legalized if H.R. 1 is signed into law. Harvesters, some of whom are paid, would be allowed to collect and distribute as many ballots as they want without limitations. Critics of ballot harvesting have argued that the practice allows for a third party to have an opportunity to tamper with ballots before they are dropped off.\n Allows the Justice Department to demand the removal of social media posts\n The Foreign Agent Disclaimer Enhancement (FADE) Act, which was added as an amendment to H.R. 1 Wednesday night, allows the Attorney General to force social media companies to remove posts by foreign agents. In order to avoid removal, the posts must be properly identified as coming from a foreign source, the amendment says.\n Giving felons the right to vote\u00a0\n People who have been convicted of a felony will have a right to vote after they have served their sentence. Felons who are currently serving time still cannot vote.\n Redistricting Conducted Through An \u201cIndependent Commission\u201d\n Congressional redistricting must be done through a state\u2019s independent redistricting commission. The commission is \u201crequired to meet certain criteria in the map-drawing process, including minimizing the division of communities of interest and a ban on drawing maps to favor a political party.\u201d Membership on the commission must be bipartisan.",

Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) to withdraw his support for Democrats\u2019 prescription drug costs bill because of the impact it may have on New Jersey\u2019s biopharmaceutical industry, Breitbart News has learned.\n\nBridgewater Township Mayor Matthew Moench (R) wrote a letter to Malinowski, dated June 9, warning H.R. 3, also\u00a0known\u00a0as the \u201cElijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,\u201d would \u201cdestroy\u201d the industry and crush jobs in New Jersey if it were to pass.\n\n\u201cAs with so many communities in New Jersey, biopharmaceutical companies are absolutely vital to Bridgewater Township\u2019s economy,\u201d Moench wrote. \u201cBut recent studies have suggested that the price fixing mechanism that is the centerpiece of H.R. 3 would destroy the industry in our state.\u201d\n\nHe estimated that in New Jersey \u2014 a hotbed for biopharmaceutical companies including Johnson & Johnson, MSD, Sanofi, and several others \u2014 the bill would eliminate nearly 100,000 jobs.\n\nRead a copy of the letter below:\n\nHouse Democrats reintroduced the drug costs bill in April this year after it had passed the Democrat-controlled House in 2019 but failed to move forward in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe bill mainly functions as a means for the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with the intent of lowering costs, but Republicans and pharmaceutical companies are generally opposed to the bill because they say innovation in the industry would suffer.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) voiced her support for the bill in April, claiming it \u201cwill make a transformative difference in the lives of hard-working families who cannot afford their medicines,\u201d though a recent\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0report\u00a0details\u00a0how at least ten House Democrats want to see the bill pass with the backing of Republicans and stakeholders.\n\nMoench wrote in his letter that \u201cbeyond the economic impacts, it is also clear that H.R. 3 would stifle the very innovation that has made our biopharmaceutical industry the envy of the world.\u201d\n\nCiting a White House Council of Economic Advisers estimate, he continued, \u201cThis bill would result in up to 100 fewer new drugs being introduced in the next decade. Fewer new drugs means fewer potentially life-saving treatments for New Jersey families.\u201d\n\nMalinowski\u00a0voted\u00a0for the 2019 version of the bill, but he has not publicly stated his position on the bill this session. Incidentally, the New Jersey Democrat was recently caught speaking candidly about a separate bill, President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill,\u00a0admitting\u00a0it included items that \u201cprobably many people would not think of as infrastructure,\u201d a fundamental concern for Republicans despite Malinowski claiming his aim was for \u201cunified\u201d support of that bill.\n\nMalinowski, who represents New Jersey\u2019s now-battleground Seventh District \u2014 which includes Bridgewater Township \u2014 just barely edged out state Sen. Tom Keane Jr. (R-Union) by one percent in his race for reelection in 2020. Conservative groups including the National Republican Congressional Committee and the American Action Network have identified the New Jersey Democrat as vulnerable to losing in next year\u2019s midterms.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to Malinowski\u2019s office for comment on H.R. 3 and Moench\u2019s letter but did not receive a response.",

    "body": "Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) announced his opposition to the For the People Act, also known as H.R. 1, a sprawling election reform bill that they had hoped would counter Republican efforts to restrict voting in many states. Mr. Manchin argued that election reform must be bipartisan, even if the bill in question would make voting fairer and easier for all, and even if Republicans flouted bipartisanship as they pursued voter suppression in state after state. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right The bad news is that, without Mr. Manchin's support, the measure will not even attract a simple majority, let alone the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The silver lining is that Mr. Manchin has full-throatedly and repeatedly endorsed another election bill , the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also favors. Despite many Democrats' desire to continue working on the For the People Act, the future of Americans' voting rights now lies with the John Lewis Act, which lawmakers must immediately prioritize. Admittedly, that bill would do far less. H.R. 1 would have ended partisan gerrymandering, required no-excuse absentee voting, created an automatic voter-registration system, set up a public campaign finance program and much more. The John Lewis Act would primarily patch the gaping hole the Supreme Court ripped in the 1965 Voting Rights Act, reestablishing the \u201cpreclearance\u201d system that operated for decades until the court's 2013 ruling. That system required states with a history of racism to obtain Justice Department preapproval before shifting voting rules, which prevented and deterred states from stacking the deck against minority voters. Almost immediately after the court's ruling, Republican-led states began passing aggressive voter-suppression laws. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Mr. Manchin has proposed reestablishing preclearance for all states, rather than just a few, which would make the system more protective than it had been and prevent the court from objecting that the federal government is singling out some states for scrutiny. That would be far better than the status quo. But, as Mr. Manchin has now made the John Lewis Act the vehicle for voting rights reform, he and Ms. Murkowski should go further. There is much in H.R. 1 that did not strictly address voting access, making it easy for Republicans to argue that it was a Democratic wish list disguised as a pro-democracy bill. Yet H.R. 1 also contained many provisions to which no lawmaker committed to democracy should object, such as early voting or streamlined voter registration. Mr. Manchin and Ms. Murkowski should specify which of those they oppose, and why, and import the ones they do not oppose into the John Lewis Act. They should also consider provisions that would prevent state legislatures or Congress from overturning electoral results. Even an unamended John Lewis Act faces long odds. Some Republican senators are already claiming that the bill is \u201ctoo much too soon\u201d and a \u201cbackdoor\u201d H.R. 1, absurd arguments given that it would mostly restore a preclearance system that worked well for decades. There may not be substantial numbers of GOP senators willing to vote for any bill that would protect Americans' voting rights. Mr. Manchin, Ms. Murkowski and other lawmakers must still try \u2014 even if all they do is force their recalcitrant colleagues to go on the record opposing what should be a noncontroversial act, and expose just how hostile the GOP has become to the principle that all Americans should have access to the ballot box.

    "body": "Lawrence Lessig, the Roy L. Furman professor of law and leadership at Harvard Law School, is the author of \u201cThey Don't Represent Us: Reclaiming Our Democracy.\u201d In 2015, Lessig was a Democratic presidential candidate. March 16, 2021 at 3:49 p.m. GMT+1 The \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d passed this month by the House, contains measures to strengthen American democracy: It would make vote suppression in the states radically more difficult, end partisan gerrymandering and change the way campaigns are funded through small-dollar matching funds, among other things. But some advocates have sounded the alarm that the act \u2014 also known as H.R. 1 \u2014 would hamstring third parties. Perhaps it bolsters democracy in some ways, but \u201cdemocracy for whom?\u201d asked Michael Feinstein, a former co-chair of the Green Party of the United States (and also former mayor of Santa Monica, Calif.). \u201cH.R. 1 contains a poison pill designed to reduce political competition and voter choice by weakening minor parties.\u201d If true, this would be troubling \u2014 not just to members of the Green Party but to the many Americans across the political spectrum who think America needs an alternative to the Democratic Party and the GOP. In a February poll by Gallup, for example, a record 62 percent agreed that \u201cthe parties do such a poor job representing the American people that a third party is needed.\u201d Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right But it's not true. H.R. 1 would make it somewhat harder for third-party presidential candidates to get federal financing, because it increases the amount of support candidates have to demonstrate to qualify. But H.R. 1 would make it significantly easier for third-party Congressional candidates to run competitive races, because for the first time, small-dollar contributions to their campaigns would be matched by federal funds. And that is where the attention of third parties should be focused, because that's where the work of changing the American political landscape will be done. On balance, the Senate's passing H.R. 1 would be a net gain not only for democracy but for third parties in particular. Stacey Abrams showed that Democrats can match the GOP at state-level organizing H.R. 1 aims to change the presidential public financing because the current system is obviously broken. Every president between Richard Nixon and Barack Obama was elected using the presidential public funding system. But in 2008, Obama opted out, and since then, no major party candidate has considered taking public money. The explanation is simple: the spending limits imposed on people who do so. In 2016, the limit in the primaries for candidates who accepted federal funds was $48 million; in the general, it was $96 million. Actual total spending by Hillary Clinton was $970 million; by Donald Trump, $531 million. Under the existing system, to qualify for federal funding, candidates must raise more than $5,000 in at least 20 states, in contributions of $250 or less \u2014 a low bar. Once qualified, contributions to candidates in the primaries (up to $250) are matched by the Federal Election Commission. In the general, major party candidates receive equal lump-sum payments \u2014 $104 million in 2020, had either candidate taken the offer. Minor party candidates receive a much smaller amount for the general election, at least if they receive 5 percent of the vote. But in exchange, any candidate taking federal funds must agree to limits that are too confining in a system awash in private money. At the presidential level, H.R. 1 would replace this regime with one that does away with spending limits, and lump-sum payments \u2014 but raises qualification requirements. Under the new system, contributions to presidential candidates of $200 or less would be matched by a 6-to-1 ratio. Private contributions would be capped at $1,000, compared with $2,800 today. Overall public funding would be limited to $250 million per candidate, indexed to inflation \u2014 a substantial increase. But campaigns could spend whatever they raise. And the law would enable national parties to spend more in coordination with the candidates. It's a system that might well entice major-party candidates to take part, and also shift the balance of power from major donors to small donors. But to participate in this system, campaigns must now raise $25,000 in 20 states, not just $5,000. That extra burden, the Green Party fears, will make it harder to enter the system. (The party also argues \u2014 separately \u2014 that the new system would amplify differences between popular and less popular candidates, because each small donation would be multiplied: If one candidate raises $100,000 and another raises $200,000, public funding would transform that difference into $700,000 vs. $1.4 million.) Clearly, the larger fundraising requirement would make it more difficult for third-party presidential candidates with limited reach to qualify for subsidies. But it's not clear that's a terrible thing. No third-party candidate in almost 30 years has had any chance to be elected. Arguably, the main effect of third parties in presidential races has been to risk throwing the election to the less-popular of the two major-party candidates. In 2000, Ralph Nader likely tipped Florida, and therefore the election, to George W. Bush, although Al Gore won the national popular vote. (Naderites dispute this, but there are online models that let you test the hypothesis.) Some have also argued that in 2016, the third-party candidates may have shifted the election to Donald Trump \u2014 though that claim is also contested If states used rank-choice-voting (as Maine and Alaska now do) \u2014 allowing voters to express their ordered preferences for multiple candidates \u2014 this spoiler effect could be eliminated. Third-party candidates would then help bring new ideas into the system, without a majoritarian downside. But until that sensible change happens, it's hard to lament the new requirements in H.R. 1. Far more important, however, is what H. R.1 would do to make it easier for third-party Congressional candidates to compete. The 6-to-1 match for small contributions applies to every elective federal office. Every candidate, including third-party candidates, could build the support they need from many small contributors, including \u2014 because now there's a strong incentive to target them \u2014 those who have never given to campaigns. H.R.1 also includes a pilot voucher program, which gives voters in some districts $50 vouchers to contribute to federal campaigns; should that program be expanded, the potential for third-party competition only grows. H.R.1 doesn't aim at equality in funding, but increased participation by ordinary citizens, and decreased dependence on large contributions from the very few. Five myths about elections There's a lot wrong with American democracy, but there's a growing consensus it needs more party competition in Congress. More competition \u2014 encouraged by the reforms in H.R. 1 \u2014 would break what political scientist Lee Drutman has called the \u201cdoom loop\u201d of two-party polarized politics. While we think of America as a two-party democracy, throughout its history the two dominant parties have always been ideologically divided. Thus America has actually been governed, in effect \u2014 when governing seemed to happen \u2014 by four parties. Those four parties competed to build coalitions that could enact major legislation in Congress. Strengthening new parties on both the right and left could well help to restore us to that more productive political reality. H.R.1 is arguably the most important democracy reform package since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It could be critical to preserving majoritarian democracy over the next decade. The bill would assure a more representative federal government by ending vote suppression in the states, partisan gerrymandering of Congress, and for the first time, by enacting public funding for Congressional elections. Third parties would benefit critically from these changes as well \u2014 not, perhaps, in vanity campaigns for president but certainly in the space where we need real party competition: Congress.

He sees you as a threat and is convinced that you've been able to succeed because you've done something underhanded \u2014 what, he can't say, but that doesn't stop him from spreading rumors around your workplace anyway. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right Last year, you were both up for promotion. The new position was an important role in the company and both of you went through repeated interviews with company officials scrutinizing your work records. You emerged on top. Your nemesis's crusade against you suddenly went into overdrive. Worse, he got his best friend, who works in H.R., to launch an investigation into your bid for the role \u2014 an investigation led by your nemesis's friend, someone who in the past has publicly agreed with your nemesis's allegations. Story continues below advertisement The H.R. guy gets to work, assuring everyone that he'll explore every rumor anyone has raised about you \u2014 solely, he assures you with solemnity, to be able to rule everything out. The claim your nemesis made about your having worked remotely from the International Space Station for a month? He's got a device that will detect the presence of jet fuel residue. The H.R. guy asks that you step out of your workspace for a week or two and he takes possession of your work computer and all of your files so that he can examine every aspect of how you've performed. He's never done this sort of investigation before, but he is insistent that he will be objective in his review. Advertisement Perhaps he'll try to be. But, invariably, he will find something suspicious; after all, the entire reason for his review is to pick out suspicious things and to treat as serious vague suspicions. For example, he ran a piece of cloth across your keyboard and the jet-fuel test came back inconclusive; that window, then, is still open. He came across a file called \u201cSystem32\" on your computer, which might be a reference to your 32-year-old nemesis's theory that you've targeted him systematically. Into the \u201csuspicious\u201d pile it goes. Things go more slowly than anticipated, but the H.R. guy is able to overcome the limited budget provided by your company thanks to contributions from your nemesis and his friends. By the end of the two-month probe, everything you've done at your job has been organized into three piles. The largest pile includes those materials that don't suggest anything questionable happened. The smallest, consisting of a few sheets of paper and a few files, are the pieces of evidence that the H.R. guy thinks offer concrete evidence of impropriety on your part. Among them, a receipt for a lunch meeting that you filed with your expenses that included parking, against the company's rules. Things like that. And then there's a substantial middle pile, containing a number of documents: all the things that the H.R. guy finds suspicious. Story continues below advertisement The H.R. guy calls a company meeting to announce that, yes, his investigation has determined that he can't rule out the possibility that you behaved inappropriately before seeking your promotion. He and your nemesis had insisted all along that their investigation had nothing to do with your new position, that it was a done deal. Now, though? They point at the two non-exculpatory piles with exaggerated shrugs. Advertisement Regardless of what you did or didn't do \u2014 which I never articulated \u2014 it's easy to see how this process for adjudicating your guilt is flawed. If there are serious concerns about your performance, which this scenario doesn't suggest is the case, there's a much more fair way to evaluate them than to have someone both inexperienced and who has demonstrated prejudice against you do the investigation. What's described above is a scenario in which there's an effort being made to rationalize the suspicions of people who are already suspicious of you. This lengthy allegory has a point, of course. It hews fairly closely to the scenario underway in Arizona, where the Republican state Senate approved a similarly objective probe into the election results in Maricopa County. Story continues below advertisement By now you've likely heard stories about that \u201caudit.\u201d It's being led by a small (if not one-person ) firm called Cyber Ninjas, which has no experience in auditing an election and which was founded by a guy who has publicly promoted debunked and nonsensical allegations of fraud in the 2020 election. It is treating as valid every theory that's been proposed for how fraud might have occurred, most infamously a claim that somehow bamboo-tainted ballots from Asia were injected into the totals. But there are myriad other questions about process, from the process for counting votes to the assumptions being made about what is and isn't a suspicious ballot. Advertisement The process is being championed by supporters of former president Donald Trump, who (with Trump) clearly hope and believe that Trump's narrow loss in the state will be called into question by the \u201caudit\u201d results. Trump has publicly claimed that the Arizona review will somehow shake loose a few bricks in the wall that's blocking his sudden return to the White House. Millions of dollars are being poured into the effort, supplementing the amount allocated by the state Senate. Criticism of this effort, for which the stakes are obviously enormous, is generally centered on the idea that it is about \u201ctransparency,\u201d that only those who are worried about what might be uncovered are actually opposed to what's happening. The argument, then, is that you should have no concerns about that H.R. guy ransacking your work record and identifying scores of things to which you'll need to respond. It's just transparency! If you didn't do anything, you should have no problem countering the perception created by those big piles labeled as \u201csuspicious.\u201d Surely everyone, including your nemesis, will sit down patiently and follow along as you explain why things such as that \u201cSystem32\u201d file are actually not suspicious at all. Certainly your bosses will see all of this for what it is and stand by you. Right? Advertisement Story continues below advertisement If you're not a witch, why would you worry about a witch hunt? It's important to remember that there's no actual evidence that something suspicious happened in Arizona. Nor is the state somehow aberrant in its results. Arizona's been trending more Democratic over time. In 2016, it voted 5.6 points more Republican than the country overall. In 2020, that narrowed slightly to 4.2 points. The results in the state have been reviewed already by objective actors and nothing unusual identified. But, in our modern political environment, there is to many no accepted \u201cobjective\u201d party; everyone from the media to state officials are seen as necessarily biased if they don't comport with the assumptions made by partisans and the hype amplified in conservative media. So an obviously nonobjective party is appointed by a nonobjective legislative body and presented by nonobjective media outlets as an official assessor of the unfounded claims that all of these parties have made. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement What's ironic here is the outlier case. Imagine if you actually had done something illegal or immoral, something you'd successfully buried out of sight from the review before your promotion. Imagine that the H.R. guy had stumbled across evidence of it and included it in his review. Because the review was itself so biased against you, the discovery is itself tainted. Had the discovery been made as part of a review conducted by an unbiased party that wasn't obviously predicated on digging up as much dirt on you as possible, the response would be different. But by being part of this review, the bar for it being treated as substantive is that much higher. There's no credible evidence to suggest that the results in Arizona were tainted beyond vague hand-waving about voting machines. There's no reason to suspect that the review underway is being conducted fairly and that its eventual findings should be treated as themselves credible on their face. There's also no reason to assume that this will matter. The audit is being conducted to elevate claims of wrongdoing and the audit is being presented as itself being evidence to that end. Guilty until suggested as guilty in a court of public opinion is not how justice works in America, much less how election results work.

In 2021, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the bill in a unanimous, bipartisan voice vote.  \u201cIt has some provisions that are pretty favorable in terms of allowing individuals to save more for retirement,\u201d said Lisa Featherngill, national director of wealth planning at Comerica Bank. \u201cAnd it has some provisions that are helpful for younger savers.\u201d  Highlights of the bill  The second Secure Act has a number of provisions that would benefit retirement savers and employers.  One would require employers to automatically enroll eligible workers in 401(k) plans at a rate of 3% of salary, which would increase annually until the employee is contributing 10% of their pay. Employees could opt out or select a different contribution amount. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees or are less than 3 years old would be excluded from the mandate.  The plan would also make changes to how much savers can contribute if they're near retirement, and when retirees need to pull money from their accounts. Individuals age 62, 63 and 64 could make catch-up contributions of $10,000, up from $6,500.  It would also increase the starting age for required minimum distributions to 73 in 2022, 74 in 2029 and 75 by 2032, up from the current 72.  Calculating Social Security benefits if you make $15 per hour  Student loan borrowers would also get a retirement boost via the legislation, which would basically allow employers to match student loan payments as contributions to retirement.  \u201cLet's say you have somebody with significant student loans and really can't contribute much to their 401(k),\u201d said Featherngill. \u201cThis would allow them the opportunity to still get an employer match on the amount paid on their student loans.\u201d  Another potential change that could help young workers is that they would be able to elect that all or some of an employer match be applied to a Roth 401(k), which would provide a tax benefit when they get to retirement, said Featherngill.  Beyond these features, the legislation would make other changes for survivors of domestic abuse, small business owners and low-wage workers eligible for certain tax credits. It would also create a national database for Americans to reclaim lost retirement accounts.  What's next  Now that it's passed the House, the legislation will be sent to the Senate for possible action in April.  There are other bills in Congress that overlap with the Secure Act, and if passed first would make similar improvements to retirement saving.  The House Education and Labor Committee in February amended the RISE Act, H.R. 5891, which also addresses retirement savings plans.  There are two similar bills in the Senate that address retirement savings. One is the Retirement Security and Savings Act, S. 1770, and the other is the Improving Access to Retirement Savings Act, S. 1703.

The suspect of the shooting was captured by police and led out of the crime scene with a bloodied leg.\nFollowing the tragedy, many prominent Democrats called for more gun control legislation online, with several eyeing an end to the filibuster to push measures through.\nSen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted that the gun violence in America is unending and claimed that gun violence will not end until the Democrats \"get rid of the filibuster and finally pass gun safety legislation that a huge majority of Americans support.\"\nBOULDER GROCERY MASSACRE LEAVES 10 DEAD INCLUDING COP, SUSPECT IN CUSTODY\n\"Week after week, month after month, year after year \u2013 the gun violence doesn't end,\" wrote Warren. \"And things won't get better until Democrats get rid of the filibuster and finally pass gun safety legislation that a huge majority of Americans support.\"\n\"What are we waiting for \u2013 another tragedy?\" the senator added.\nFormer Housing and Urban Development (HUD) chief Juli\u00e1n Castro mirrored Warren, also calling for the Senate to nix the filibuster and push through gun control legislation.\n\"Less than two weeks ago the House passed critical gun safety legislation,\" wrote Castro. \"It\u2019s time we end the filibuster, pass it in the Senate, and better protect our communities from this violence.\"\nGARLAND SAYS DOJ WOULD 'ADVANCE' BIDEN'S PRO-GUN CONTROL POLICIES\nCalls for gun control legislation came from House leadership\u00a0as well, with Assistant Speaker of the House Katherine Clark, D-Mass., joining the other members of her party.\u00a0\n\"No more obstruction.

    "body": "It\u2019s an attempt to make prescription drugs more affordable by having the government regulate prices \u2014 an idea that, however popular, has never gotten past the opposition of conservatives in Congress and their allies in the pharmaceutical industry. With Democrats apparently a few votes short of what they need to pass such legislation this year, plenty of lawmakers, officials and political professionals are convinced this latest attempt will fail too.Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) isn\u2019t one of them. In a recent interview with HuffPost, he said he remains confident that Democrats will ultimately get behind reforms that produce significant savings for taxpayers, employers and individuals buying drugs at the pharmacy counter.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this done,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important. It matters too much to the lives of so many people.\u201dThat belief could be sheer bravado \u2015 or perhaps unfounded optimism from the famously earnest, preternaturally upbeat senator who has been working on health care for his entire political career. But several sources who favor strong government action on drug prices and are privy to negotiations have told HuffPost they have the same impression.They think that passing something is more likely than passing nothing. They also think the final legislation is likely to include versions of two ideas they\u2019ve long touted: direct government negotiation of prices and limits on year-to-year increases. These are the same provisions that Wyden has said all year long must be part of legislation.But the same sources also issued a warning. Simply including those provisions isn\u2019t enough. They have to be meaningful \u2015 as in, they have to bring down the price of drugs significantly.Wyden says he is optimistic here too. But the details matter a lot, and it is over those details that officials, lawmakers and lobbyists are arguing right now.The case for action on prescription drugs is straightforward: Americans pay a lot more for their drugs than counterparts overseas because the U.S. is the only economically advanced country where the government doesn\u2019t get directly involved in setting prices. Democrats have been promising to change that ever since the early 2000s, when a Republican-written law creating the drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries explicitly prohibited such government interference. The closest Democrats have come to doing this so far was two years ago, when House Democrats passed H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. Under H.R. 3, the federal government would choose a subset of drugs \u2015 at least 25 in the program\u2019s first year, 50 starting with the second \u2015 from among the pharmaceuticals the country spends the most on. It would then negotiate the prices of these drugs directly with manufacturers, with a stipulation that the drugs couldn\u2019t cost more than an \u201cinternational index\u201d based on the average of what several peer countries (like Germany and the U.K.) pay. H.R. 3 was a compromise among different factions within the Democratic House caucus; progressives in particular wished it could have applied negotiations to a larger group of drugs. But it had potential to generate significant savings \u2015 and not just for seniors on Medicare. Private insurers, employers and individuals could all take advantage of the same prices. Drugmakers would be free to ignore the negotiations and sell at a higher price, but if they did so the government would slap them with a tax that would dramatically reduce profits. The bill died because the Senate, then under Republican leadership, refused to take it up. Democrats had been hoping to resurrect the bill or something like it now that they control both houses of Congress and the White House, as well. President Joe Biden has gotten fully on board with the cause, in part because the budget savings (through lower Medicare spending) from drug price regulation could help offset the cost of other health care initiatives, like extending dental benefits to seniors and covering low-income people in states that have not expanded Medicaid. But getting aggressive legislation through Congress is proving difficult, even in the House, where Democrats have a much smaller majority than they did in 2019. It means that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) can afford to lose no more than three votes, and already a handful of Democrats \u2015 all with ties to the drug industry \u2015 are insisting on less aggressive price regulation, even though they voted for H.R. 3 when it came up two years ago. The Senate has been, if anything, more difficult. With no prospect of GOP support, Democrats need all 50 of their caucus members to support legislation. Two in particular have been difficult sells: Bob Menendez of New Jersey, which is home to 14 of the world\u2019s 20 largest drug companies, and Kyrsten Sinema, who especially lately has been pulling in drug company donations. Wyden is in the middle of the ongoing negotiations, partly because the Finance Committee has direct jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, and its staff handles the bulk of the policy work on drug legislation. Plus Wyden has a long history of working \u2015 and wonking out \u2015 on health care, going back to the 1970s when he an advocate for seniors in the Gray Panthers organization. Two years ago, while House Democrats were writing their bill, Wyden worked with Chuck Grassley, then the GOP finance chairman, on a bipartisan piece of legislation that didn\u2019t have negotiation but did have a version of \u201cinflation caps\u201d \u2015 basically, limits on how much drug companies could raise prices year after year. That legislation, which Senate Republican leaders also refused to bring to the floor, gave advocates reason to think Wyden was personally invested in the cause of drug price reform. But it also worried some who thought he might make another futile effort at bipartisanship and push a bill that didn\u2019t include price negotiation, the key component of H.R. 3. Wyden made clear that wasn\u2019t his intention \u2015 that he was willing to write a bill only Democrats would support and that he was determined to include negotiation, which was a position he\u2019s long endorsed. He reiterated that position as recently as Thursday in a Capitol Hill scrum with reporters. \u201cLet\u2019s have no confusion about it,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cWe will not give up on negotiation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to insist upon it and we\u2019re going to go to the mat for it,\u201d Wyden added when asked to clarify what he meant. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can be more blunt about that.\u201d One reason to think Wyden and other proponents of negotiation will get their way is the actions of one of those Democratic holdouts in the House, Scott Peters of California. Peters, whose San Diego-area district includes a number of smaller drug companies, is a longtime skeptic of aggressive government intervention on prices. Earlier this year, he introduced an alternative to H.R. 3 \u2015 and it included a form of negotiation, almost certainly because the idea is so popular that even Peters felt compelled to endorse the concept publicly. Of course, the actual negotiation scheme in the Peters bill is conspicuously weak. It limits negotiation to only a small subset of drugs, and it doesn\u2019t limit the range for negotiated prices as tightly as H.R. 3 would. And that\u2019s the big worry as Wyden, Senate leadership and the rest of his colleagues hash out what negotiation would look like in their version of legislation \u2015 that the compromises necessary to get it past Menendez and Sinema and any other skittish senators would substantially weaken its effect. Wyden has already acknowledged one concession publicly: Because too many senators objected to H.R. 3\u2019s \u201c international index \u201d for setting the price range on negotiations, the bill will likely use some sort of \u201c domestic index \u201d instead. One way it might work, sources have said, is that the government would go back to the launch price of a drug, use one of several available figures for what private insurers actually paid for the drug at the time, adjust it by some percentage and account for inflation \u2015 and then use that figure for the upper limit on what a drug company could charge. In principle, such a scheme could generate just as much savings as the one in H.R. 3. But it really depends on other key variables, like whether the program includes more or fewer drugs, has different formulas for different kinds of drugs, even something as technical as which launch price average is the basis for calculations. There\u2019s an \u201caverage manufacturers price,\u201d a \u201caverage wholesaler\u2019s price,\u201d and so on. Each has different factors built into it. A lot would also depend on the negotiation process for new drugs, as opposed to those that have been on sale for a while. The other key component of drug legislation, limiting year-to-year inflation, matters too, although it\u2019s gotten far less attention publicly. Wyden has been just as insistent that final legislation include some form of these \u201cinflation caps,\u201d and because Democrats are so determined to generate real savings \u2015 for individual consumers as well as employers and taxpayers \u2015 there\u2019s been talk of making those inflation caps even more aggressive, to make up for the weaker negotiation provisions. One source told HuffPost a few weeks ago advocates were hoping for \u201cinflation caps on steroids.\u201d The inflation caps could be crucial for another reason. Extending negotiated prices beyond Medicare to the private sector, as H.R. 3 envisioned, may not be possible under the byzantine rules that govern the budget reconciliation process, which is the parliamentary procedure Democrats are using to pass legislation. But extending inflation caps may be OK, because they have a different policy mechanism that would satisfy reconciliation rules, at least as the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian interprets them. The same factors that make inflation caps potentially effective at generating savings also make them politically difficult: The drug industry doesn\u2019t like them. And in arguing against any of the provisions, the industry and its allies \u2015 including Peters and a few other House Democrats \u2015 have cited the potential danger to innovation. Significantly curtailing industry profits, they say, will make it harder for drug companies to attract investment money, given that drug research is inherently risky \u2015 especially when it comes to the smaller biopharma firms working on cutting-edge treatments. Restrict drug spending too much, the theory goes, and it will mean fewer miracle cures in the future. Most experts believe that reducing drug industry revenue could, in principle, reduce the number of innovations. The debate is over whether the legislation under discussion would actually have that effect, how big the effect might be, and whether reducing the number of drugs would actually mean fewer breakthroughs. As advocates like to point out, much of what passes for \u201cinnovation\u201d these days are drugs of questionable clinical value. They say legislation could actually push drug development in the direction of higher clinical value \u2015 in other words, to get more breakthroughs rather than fewer \u2015 by having the federal government invest more in research and development. Wyden has long identified that as a core goal, promising to spend more on the National Institutes of Health, which develops the basic science that leads to drug breakthroughs. He has also stressed the need to support smaller firms that are doing most of the innovating today. The federal government already has one program, called the Small Business Innovation Research fund, which effectively offers venture capital to startups through a number of agencies. A Democratic drug bill could add money to this fund and target it at drug development. Wyden wouldn\u2019t say whether that was the specific idea he had in mind, just as he declined to talk about the negotiations with specific senators. And he\u2019s been careful to warn that the final legislation will have compromises, like the idea of a \u201cphase-in\u201d for certain provisions that he floated \u2015 without details \u2015 on Thursday. But amid all the public skepticism about the state of legislation, on drugs specifically and the Build Back Better bill more generally, Wyden told HuffPost that he and his colleagues were making a lot more progress than it might seem from the outside. \u201cI was never under any illusions that this was going to be a walk in the park,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cBut these things are always impossible \u2015 until 15 minutes before they come together.\u201d That moment may come very soon, at which point people can stop asking whether there will be a deal and start asking what the deal looks like.

    "body": "H.R. 1, if enacted into law, would make American elections resemble those in the former Soviet Union, said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), on Thursday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\nBrooks said, \u201cH.R. 1 is the worst piece of legislation relating to elections in the history of the United States of America. It does more to undermine our republic than any legislation I have ever seen or heard of, even looking back in the history books. By way of example, it registers 16- and 17-year-olds. It registers people automatically from multiple different sources like drivers licenses, social security cards, [or] any number of government sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you move from one address to another, you\u2019re going to get registered twice,\u201d he continued. \u201cSomeone like myself, if it\u2019s Morris Jackson Brooks Jr. at one place, but Morris Jay Brooks Jr. at another, you get registered twice.\n\nBrooks warned that H.R. 1, named the For the People Act, will facilitate voter fraud if enacted as law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be massive voter fraud,\u201d he held. \u201cIn short, the Democrats have ignored and undermined the Commission on Federal Election Reform report in 2005 \u2014 a bipartisan commission report by Jimmy Carter on the one hand and James Baker on the other hand \u2014 and have expanded the very worst of the things that the report said we needed to avoid.\u201d\n\nBrooks stated, \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about non-citizens voting in American elections. H.R. 1 is going to make it much easier, because it makes it a criminal offense for a poll worker to deny a non-citizen voting at the polls. That\u2019s craziness, but that\u2019s what they do with this legislation by tying the hands of our poll workers, who will be fearful of being prosecuted if they challenge a non-citizen who is trying to vote in an American election.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn another level, the bipartisan report from 2005 says we need to minimize mass mail-out of [ballots], [and] minimize absentee voting, because that is where fraud is most likely to occur,\u201d Brooks added. \u201cWhat do the Democrats do? They expand it dramatically. The exact opposite of what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nBrooks remarked, \u201cThere are dozens of provisions in this legislation that undermine the sacredness and the accuracy of the elections, and what we saw in a few places in the country in 2020 with the massive voter fraud that was occurring in those places would now become commonplace throughout the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn sum, the reliability the trustworthiness of American elections under H.R. 1 would be akin to those in the old Soviet Union, or in Cuba, or in Venezuela, or North Korea.

Bennie Thompsom's\u00a0lone \"no\" vote against H.R. 1, the massive voting rights and election reform legislation, was no accident.\u00a0\nThompson, of Mississippi, joined with all Republicans late Wednesday to vote against the House Democrats' top legislative priority, known as the For the People Act of 2021.\nThompson's vote was surprising since he was a co-sponsor of the legislation along with the rest of the Democratic caucus. But Thompson said Thursday his constituents weren't supportive of the election overhaul, so he stood with them\u00a0rather than his colleagues.\u00a0\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS PASS EXTENSIVE VOTING AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL, H.R. 1\n\"My constituents opposed the redistricting portion of the bill as well as the section on public finances,\" Thompson said in a statement to Fox News. \"I always listen and vote in the interest of my constituents.\"\nThe legislation requires states to establish independent redistricting commissions to carry out the once-a-decade redrawing of congressional districts in an effort to avoid partisan gerrymandering. The bill also establishes a\u00a0new public financing system\u00a0for congressional and presidential elections to incentivize small-dollar\u00a0donations.\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS' H.R. 1 WOULD CREATE NEW PUBLIC FINANCING OF CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGNS\nThe legislation would create a\u00a06:1\u00a0match for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200.\u00a0For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400.\nThe public match program would be funded by a new 4.75%\u00a0surcharge on\u00a0criminal and civil penalties and settlements that corporations pay to the U.S. government. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated this week\u00a0the new revenue stream would generate about $3.2\u00a0billion over 10 years.\n\n      Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.\n      \n\n\nThe election\u00a0legislation\u00a0passed by a vote of\u00a0220\u00a0to 210. No Republicans joined with Democrats in approving the sweeping voter rights reform\u00a0that now heads to the Senate.\u00a0\nNumbered\u00a0H.R. 1 to signify it is the top priority of House Democrats, the legislation would also\u00a0enact automatic voter registration, restore\u00a0voting rights to felons after they have completed their sentences and expand early voting access and absentee voting.\nREP. BENNIE THOMPSON FILES CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP FOR JAN. 6 RIOT: 'WE MUST HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE'\nIt also prohibits voter roll purges and\u00a0partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, imposes new campaign finance rules, and requires presidential nominees to release 10 years of tax returns.\u00a0\nH.R. 1 would also take aim at big-dollar donors and dark money in politics by requiring\u00a0additional disclosure of campaign donors and disclaimers on political advertising.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe legislation now heads to the Senate where it has a tough road for passage as the chamber is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. The legislation would require 60 votes to advance and needs GOP support.",

An astonishing five people are now dead, but they would be alive if not for the rioters\u2019 anti-democratic trespassing, breaking and entering, vandalism and more.\n\"Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem,\" President Trump said in a video message released Thursday night, in which he recognized that \"a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th.\" The president added: \"The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy.\"\nThese evils aside, these savages are just plain stupid. These Olympic-class boneheads make every rank-and-file bonehead resemble Albert Einstein. These thugs\u2019 incursion against America\u2019s national legislature was an act of breathtaking political self-sabotage.\nNEWT GINGRICH: CAPITOL RIOTS -- STOP ALL THE VIOLENCE AND GIVE MIKE PENCE THE PRIZE FOR COURAGE\nWednesday\u2019s mayhem was as needlessly, bafflingly self-defeating as a pack of teachers union organizers kicking down the Capitol\u2019s doors while a Democratic Senate approved the School Choice Annihilation Act of 2021.\nJust when these hoodlums smashed into the Capitol, Congress was debating GOP objections to Arizona\u2019s electors for Joe Biden.\nGrand Canyon State Republican Rep. Andy Biggs showed a stack of voter registrations that were approved after their statutory deadline. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, offered his constitutional arguments against Arizona\u2019s electoral lawlessness.\nLeft in peace, Republican objectors would have presented affidavits, documents, and other evidence of irregularities and illegalities in up to six states. Even if this didn\u2019t change the outcome of the election, Americans at least would have learned some of the gravely serious reasons why 39 percent of Americans believe \"the election was rigged,\" according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll. This view is shared by 67 percent of Republicans, 31 percent of independents, and even 17 percent of Democrats.\u00a0\nBut nooooo!\nThese barbarians disrupted the very process that they demanded and rendered this noble cause as radioactive as plutonium.\nRather than rally lawmakers for election integrity, these savages repelled them. After rattled legislators reconvened, GOP senators Steve Daines of Montana and James Lankford of Oklahoma turned against scrutinizing multi-state vote-fraud allegations.\nSen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., freshly defeated by far-left Democrat Raphael Warnock in Tuesday\u2019s runoff election, abandoned her challenge to her state\u2019s highly tainted Electoral College votes, among others.\u00a0\n\"I cannot now, in good conscience, object to the certification of these electors,\" she told colleagues. \"The\u00a0violence, the lawlessness, and siege of the halls of Congress are abhorrent\u00a0and stand as a direct\u00a0attack on the very institution that my objection was intended to protect.\"\nNice work, pro-Trump goons.\nHere\u2019s some free advice from a veteran commentor and activist: When politicians are busy doing exactly what you begged them to do, don\u2019t send them fleeing for their lives in gas masks.\nThese marauders have imperiled the fight for election integrity, humiliated hundreds of thousands of peaceful Trump supporters in Washington and millions of others across America, and scarred the president\u2019s scores of path-breaking accomplishments.\nThose behind this chaos also made an in-kind contribution to the Democratic National Committee worth about $10 billion. The DNC and related groups will remind voters of this week\u2019s carnage for decades to come.\u00a0\nMost urgently, and ironically, these bums have made it tougher for Republicans to oppose H.R. 1.\nThe 117th Congress\u2019 first bill, mirrors the first in the 116th. The For the People Act should be called the Vote Fraud Decriminalization Act.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nH.R. 1 would codify numerous dodgy-ballot-fueling measures that COVID-19 \"required\" last year.\nWhile the new H.R. 1 awaits full text, it likely would mirror its previous namesake. Among other things, 2019\u2019s bill would have:\n\u2014 \u00adBroadened no-excuse absentee and mail-in ballots.\n\u2014 Tampered with absentee-ballot submission deadlines.\n\u2014 Abolished voter ID laws.\n\u2014 Mandated that states allow 16-year-olds to register to vote.\n\u00a0\u2014 Ordered instant voter registration at the polls.\n\u2014 Launched online voter registration.\n\u2014 Complicated states\u2019 efforts to update voter rolls.\n\u2014 Required 15 days of early voting.\nIf Republicans oppose this gambit to make voting less secure, Democrats now can respond: \"This is just another conspiracy theory from the allies of those who attacked our Capitol.\" Grossly unfair? Yes. Will Democrats say this? Is milk white?\nBut frustrating a potential fight against H.R.1 \u2014 as Democrats control the Senate, House, and White House \u2014 is the least of the pro-Trump hooligans\u2019 crimes.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThese rioters broke the law and must pay for their offenses, especially those who were photographed dangling from a balcony over the Senate floor, sitting in the chair on the Senate dais, and grinning behind House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s desk.\nThe next thing they and their fellow insurrectionists should hear is: \"You have the right to remain silent.\"\nBucknell University student Michael Malarkey contributed research to this opinion piece.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DEROY MURDOCK",

You called George Santos \u201ca sick puppy.\u201d You countered Republican claims that the handling of the notorious Chinese balloon was mishandled by saying \u201cI believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care.\u201d\n  You only get a 51% rating from the Republican Heritage Foundation, which is a bellwether of current Republican policy \u201cthinking\u201d (you must be willing to truly stretch the definition of the word \u201cthinking\u201d here).\n  You also voted for the Respect for Marriage Act ( H.R. 8404 ), the CHIPS Act ( H.R. 4346 ), the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act ( S. 2938 ), and for the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. You even voted for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ( H.R. 3684\n  True, you did vote against the Inflation Reduction Act, The Women's Health Protection Act, and a few others you shouldn't have, and maybe you would have voted the same as a Democrat, but who knows? You're more of a policy wonk than you get credit for, and you aren't the ideologue that Mitch McConnell and most other Senate Republicans are.\n  You are, in other words, a centrist Democrat. A corporate Democrat, but aren't all senators not named Bernie? As long as Citizens United is the law of the land, we're all doomed to a corporate autocracy until the streets fill up with people who've had enough. So I'll just have to live with that.\n  I guess you will probably vote similarly to Joe Manchin, but so what? You'll be making a statement about the destruction of your party. Maybe you'll even head off the possible destruction of the country, especially if a couple more of your more centrist friends follow suit in the Senate and House.\n  You're a traditionalist Republican in a party that no longer believes in the tradition that its leaders used to proudly stand by.\n  For someone like me, that old grand tradition was anathema to the kind of egalitarian thinking this country needs more of, but at least there was a certain reliability to it.\n  I can imagine how you must feel, Mitt. Seeing the transition of what pundits used to fondly refer to as the Grand Old Party (GOP) must be like how the rest of us feel when we see the latest Winnie the Pooh trailers.\n  In fact, there's almost no difference. The Republican Party has transitioned from a corporate cheerleader to a grotesque amalgamation of crazy people in six short years.\n  The current leader of your party, who looks a lot like the new Pooh, presided over hundreds of thousands of American deaths when he openly resisted vaccines and masks and attacked the integrity of Dr. Fauci. Did you ever attack Dr. Fauci, Mitt?\n  Just to remind you, this is what you said about Fauci in 2020:\n  \u201cDr. Fauci is an esteemed professional with extraordinary expertise and capability, and I have full confidence in his leadership and capacity.\u201d\n  Your ex-president created and led a hate cult that is still going strong. He has promoted an anti-science message when people actually need science more than ever.\n  I won't catalog any more of this. You already know all about it. We can sum it all up by simply saying that the Republican Party has turned into a horror show.\n  Make a statement, Mitt. We know you're a Mormon. You'll never vote for women's health.

The legislation will receive a full House vote for the first time since it was introduced more than three decades ago.\n\nThe legislation, H.R. 40, was first introduced in 1989, but Wednesday was the first time the House Judiciary Committee had voted on the legislation, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe bill, which passed the committee despite opposition from Republicans, would establish a 13-person commission to study the effects of slavery and discrimination in the US, and then submit its findings and recommend to Congress \"appropriate remedies\" for the descendants of enslaved Americans.\n\nRead more: It's now or never for Democrats: either pass H.R. 1 or watch voter suppression bills like Georgia's become the norm\n\n\"This legislation is long overdue,\" said Democrat Rep.

    "body": "The U.S. House of Representatives appears poised to pass a bill to establish a reparations commission, which John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) first introduced in 1989. Conyers regularly sponsored the bill \u2014 known as H.R. 40, for the \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d promise made to formerly enslaved Black people by a Union general in 1865 \u2014 and usually got about 30 co-sponsors, mostly Black lawmakers. The bill never made it out of committee.  After Conyers retired in 2017, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) took over the bill. In the last congressional session, she won more than 173 co-sponsors, including a sizable number of White Democrats. This round, the bill has 196 backers; the bill was voted out of committee in April 2021.  What changed? Why is H.R. 40 suddenly passable?  Several developments worked in the bill's favor. Black lawmakers are now key players in Washington. While Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) members were once critics and outsiders in an unresponsive Democratic Party, they are now party insiders. And the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 pushed many Democratic legislators to take Black concerns more seriously.  Like Breonna Taylor, Black women are often killed in private \u2014 even when it's by police  As Black legislators have gotten more powerful, they've also become less radical  Political scientists Rufus P. Browning, Dale Rogers Marshall and David H. Tabb call it \u201cminority political incorporation\u201d when minority groups join a dominant policymaking coalition. Based on that definition, Black people have now politically incorporated in Washington. The United States elected a Black president in 2008 and 2012, and then in 2020 saw a Black and South Asian American woman become vice president. The Black Lives Matter movement that became national in 2014 in response to Michael Brown's death in Missouri and Eric Garner's in New York has made Congress more amenable to racial bills. The overwhelming response to George Floyd's murder in May 2020 foregrounded racial justice as a national and international concern. Finally, a number of candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) , expressed their support for Black reparations.  The Floyd protests were the broadest in U.S. history, spreading even to White, small-town America  I argue that incorporation is a two-sided process that changes both the minority legislators and the dominant party. As new groups win greater influence over the policymaking process, they must also accommodate the dominant governing coalition's policy interests if they want to advance and become effective political leaders. My research finds historical evidence that Black Democratic legislators have become less radical as they have been incorporated. And as Black Democrats who form the CBC, established in 1971, have become more powerful, they have also become less willing to openly defy congressional party leaders or either Republican or Democratic presidents.  Some of my research involved a statistical analysis of Black roll-call votes using the important Poole-Rosenthal scores from 1977 to 2019. Poole-Rosenthal scores were developed to track legislative behavior over time and run from -1 for the most liberal to +1 for most conservative, with 0 as the moderate midpoint.  I found that while House Democrats have become more liberal over time, Black Democrats have become more moderate. And while Black Democrats are still more liberal than Democrats in general in the House, their ideological scores are significantly closer to the House Democrats' average scores today than in the 1970s and 1980s.  Black Democrats' average score has fallen from -0.56 in 1977 to -0.48 in 2009 to -0.46 in 2019, while House Democrats' average score has changed from -0.29 in 1977 to -0.36 in 2009. This moderation has enabled Black members of Congress to hold leadership party positions and alter the party's platform to be more friendly to Black political interests.  A different generation and an exceptional period  Reparations, however, is a much more radical racial policy than, say, the budget proposals that the CBC endorses as more liberal alternatives to the standard budget. Of course, the current bill calls only for a commission to study reparations \u2014 but even that legitimizes the idea.  Two factors make this possible. First is the persistence of the old guard of Black legislators, who still serve in large numbers in Congress \u2014 and who are the ones who have sponsored the bill. Controlling for other factors including year, my research has found that older Black Democratic House legislators have been the most liberal. Conyers, who retired at the age of 88, and Jackson Lee, who is 72, belong to a generation that was politicized during the 1960s civil rights movement , unlike younger Black legislators \u2014 and they have ascended into important positions in the party.  Second, the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 summer of protests changed the national political discussion \u2014 making Washington more receptive to racial demands. A June 2020 poll taken by the Pew Research Center showed that two-thirds of U.S. respondents said they support the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2016, only 4 in 10 U.S. respondents supported it. (Support for Black Lives Matter then dropped in September 2020 to 55 percent nationally, still an increase over 2016.) Political scientist Daniel Gillion finds that protests directly influence Congress. In particular, legislators from districts that had protests reported in the New York Times from 1960 to 1995 became more likely to vote in a liberal direction on racial policy concerns. Political scientist LaGina Gause finds similar results. Because Black Lives Matter protests happened in every U.S. congressional district , this activism probably shifted the climate to enable the reparations bill to move forward.  Congress finally passed a federal anti-lynching bill \u2014 after 40 years of failure  Prospects for H.R. 40's future  Still, the approaching midterm elections may close the window of opportunity for H.R. 40 to pass. Even if it passes the House, few expect it to pass the Senate. Some legislators are reportedly pressuring President Biden to create a reparations commission through executive order if Congress fails to act.  With midterms generally favoring the party out of power, Republicans are expected to win majorities in both chambers in the November elections. Republicans are dead set against H.R. 40. Polling shows that reparations for Black slavery are opposed by 90 percent of Republicans and by a majority of White Americans.  Nonetheless, Black congressional leaders have helped transform U.S. politics. Black people are accepted as political leaders of major cities and in national government. Discussion of reparations for slavery is underway in Congress today because of a mix of Black political clout and activists who continue to demand a radical vision of empowerment and racial justice.

    "body": "WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 12: President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Administration's Build Back ... [+] Better agenda to lower prescription drug prices in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, Aug. 12, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Times via Getty Images \n  \n \nOn Thursday, September 9th, the White House released a long-awaited plan to reduce prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for patients. The plan is more conspicuous for what it doesn\u2019t tackle, or leaves unsaid, than what it addresses (mostly) indirectly and incrementally.\n \n \nThe report asserts that prescription drug prices in the U.S. are \u201ctoo high,\u201d putatively due to lack of competition. The plan identifies myriad \u201cmarket failures\u201d that prevent competitive pricing of drugs from occurring. According to the report, the prescription drug market exhibits \u201cmonopolistic or oligopolistic behavior.\u201d As illustrations, the report cites stakeholders erecting barriers to entry, such as patent thickets and pay-for-delay schemes. Without elaborating, the report points to the market operating suboptimally by incentivizing list price inflation, and encouraging a disproportionate amount of research and development spending to go towards \u201cme-too drugs rather than new treatments and cures.\u201d\n \nThe White House plan highlights legislative policies Congress could pursue to rectify the issue of high drug prices, chief among them, allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate Medicare Part B (physician-administered) and Part D (outpatient) drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies and make those prices available in the commercial market.\n \n \nHowever, details are scant as to precisely what this \u201cnegotiation\u201d will look like. To illustrate, the plan posits that an effective negotiation policy must establish criteria for market failure, define and then negotiate a fair price for \u201chigh-priced drugs for which there are no competitors,\u201d using unspecified \u201ctools.\u201d But, this begs the question of how fairness is to be determined. And, which tools does the plan have in mind? Based on what\u2019s in the report, we don\u2019t know.\n \n \nPerhaps the most intriguing administrative lever included in the report is a proposed \u201ctesting of small-scale, mandatory models using value-based payments in Medicare Part B, in which payment for drugs is directly linked to the clinical value they provide patients.\u201d Surely here\u2019s where we\u2019d expect to find mention of a tool HHS could use to evaluate clinical value; for example, an independent assessment entity to determine the clinical value of drugs and subsequently provide recommendations to the public sector. But, the report keeps mum on nailing down any specific tool. \n \n \nAlso, conspicuously absent is support for an international price referencing scheme that would peg U.S. prices of certain drugs to what foreign governments pay for the same drugs. Ostensibly, this would align price and value. Though, it\u2019s unclear how the importation of arbitrarily set price ceilings would do so. The use of international price benchmarks is included in a bill - H.R.3 (Lower Drug Costs Now Act) - that passed the House in December 2019, was reintroduced in April 2021, and is the topic of ongoing discussions in Congress, in the media, and among policy wonks. Presumably, the Biden Administration backs H.R.3, yet perhaps not inclusion of an international price index.\n \n \nIn August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed rescinding the Most Favored Nations rule, advanced by the Trump Administration. A forerunner to H.R.3, this regulation would have incorporated an international price index mechanism. Namely, it would have required Medicare pay no more for certain drugs than the lowest price paid for those drugs by 22 other developed nations. As the proposed rescission is being debated, we\u2019re left guessing as to what the Biden Administration\u2019s current thinking is in this matter. The White House plan leaves us groping for answers.\n \nThe plan pledges support of a redesign of the Medicare Part D benefit that would institute a lower cap on out-of-pocket spending to protect beneficiaries. There is nothing new here, as two bills in Congress, H.R.3 and S.2543 (Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act), both restructure the Part D benefit to \u201crealign incentives.\u201d In other words, both bills propose shifting much more of the cost management burden onto payers and drug manufacturers in the catastrophic coverage phase of the Part D benefit; so, after the point at which the cap on Medicare beneficiary out-of-pocket spending is reached. This in turn is supposed to induce lower prices, especially of high-priced specialty pharmaceuticals.\n \nIn line with H.R.3 and S.2543, the plan aims to curb annual price increases of existing drugs covered by Medicare Part B and D drugs, imposing an inflationary rebate for those that exceed a hitherto unspecific inflation index (consumer or medical price inflation index). Noticeably untouched, however, are launch prices of new drugs. High launch prices of new drugs could offset at least some of the inflationary rebates incurred on existing drug price increases. H.R.3 stipulates that drugs that are new to market could also be \u201csubject to negotiation if their list price is greater than median household income.\u201d But, in the White House plan there is no mention of this provision. \n \nThe report does contain numerous administrative items that HHS intends to pursue without Congress. Nevertheless, the laundry list essentially constitutes a continuation of the previous Administration\u2019s policies with respect to, among other items:\n \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Promoting approval and usage of generics and biosimilars\n \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Experimentation with value-based contracting in the public sector\n \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prohibition on \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements which prevent generic entry.\n \nOn the whole, the plan is more conspicuous for what it doesn\u2019t tackle than what it does address. It soft-pedals where the previous Administration was controversially audacious.\n \nIn 2018, the Trump Administration released a Blueprint to lower drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. This document was bold in scope with respect to several core issues in the pharmaceutical pricing system as a whole. As mentioned, it confronted Medicare Part B prices head on, even using contestable international price referencing as an administrative lever, bypassing a legislative process. \n \nPerhaps more importantly, it focused on what is perceived as a nagging problem of an opaque PBM rebate system that yields perverse financial incentives and doesn\u2019t necessarily serve the best interests of Medicare beneficiaries.\n \nDrug manufacturers pay rebates to PBMs in exchange for moving market share towards products for which rebates are paid post-hoc. While a portion of rebates is retained as profit by PBMs, a larger percentage of the rebate pie is returned to payers and employers who contract with PBMs. These rebates don\u2019t get passed through to patients, whose cost-share is calculated as a percentage of a drug\u2019s list price.\n \nThanks to Adam Fein, who coined the phrase gross-to-net bubble, it\u2019s known that while list prices of prescription drugs have been increasing at a steady annual clip, net prices have been stagnant. The gap between gross and net sales, comprised mostly of rebates, has been widening significantly in recent years.\n \nDrug manufacturer rebates can lead to lower net prices for preferred pharmaceuticals. However, at the same time, rebates - and especially rebate walls - are deemed anti-competitive by critics, as they can deter new entrants through exclusionary contracts.\n \nThe Blueprint laid out a detailed plan to overhaul PBM rebates by removing their safe harbor, meaning rebates would be subject to prosecution under federal anti-kickback laws. In effect, this would imply that rebates would have to be passed through to Medicare beneficiaries at the pharmacy counter. In addition, the Blueprint attempted to refocus the 340B program towards its intended purpose of granting hospitals steep discounts for prescription drugs dispensed for the indigent. The Blueprint stipulated additional regulatory oversight for the 340B program; for example, ascertaining that participating hospitals met certain thresholds for uncompensated care for the poor along with a pass-through of savings to patients at the pharmacy counter.\n \nImplicitly, the Biden Administration report acknowledges that PBM rebate practices can be anti-competitive. Yet, it doesn\u2019t confront this contentious issue directly. Further, the White House report also doesn\u2019t target the 340B program, which is being abused, and is leading to precisely the kind of price gouging the plan purports to want to remedy. Patients covered by Medicare Part D and commercial insurance are de facto footing the bill for 340B savings (steep discounts for purchased drugs) that accrue to hospitals that participate in the program. In fact, an insured patient can pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for a prescribed drug, even as the 340B hospital and its contract pharmacy generate substantial profits. Meanwhile, commercial and Medicare health plans pay full price for the drug, further subsidizing hospitals and PBM-owned specialty pharmacies.\n \nProponents of the Biden Administration plan might say that it\u2019s worse to have a set of provocative initiatives, like the Blueprint released by the Trump Administration in 2018, most of which didn\u2019t get off the ground, than a more measured proposal with actionable items for the legislative and executive branches to implement. There\u2019s validity to this, though it remains to be seen whether any substantive action will be taken by Congress, and whether the proposed administrative levers will have a meaningful impact on drug prices.",

Barry Moore (R-Alabama) wants to do now? Well, on February 17, 2023, Moore introduced a bill, H.R.1095 , that would declare the AR-15 style rifle the \u201cNational Gun of the United States.\u201d Yep, three days after Valentine's Day, he introduced this Bill that will be first discussed by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. And the bill has a trio of co-sponsors: Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), Rep. George Santos (R-New York), and Rep. Andrew S. Clyde (R-Georgia).\n  The description of the Bill on the Congressional website currently does not have much more (or Moore) clarification beyond its stated title: \u201cTo declare an AR-15 style rifle chambered in a .223 Remington round or a 5.56x45mm NATO round to be the National Gun of the United States.\u201d So it does not elaborate why Moore, Boebert, Santos, and Clyde specifically feel that such legislation is needed at this point or why taxpayer money should be spent deliberating such a legislation.\n  At the moment, there is no official \u201cNational Gun of the United States.\u201d Sure, there's a National Bird (the bald eagle), a National Mammal (the North American bison), a National Floral Emblem (the Rose), and a National Tree (the Oak tree). But it's not as if there's a National something for every common organism or object. For example, there is no official National food item, although some might relish having hot dogs fill this role. And there's no National hair style, regardless of how many mullets may be out there. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has promoted the AR-15 as \u201cAmerica's rifle.\u201d However, the NRA is not officially the government, at least it's not supposed to be.\n   Assistant State Attorney Mike Satz receives a Smith & Wesson M&P15 AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle ...

(Photo by Amy Beth Bennett-Pool/Getty Images)\n  Getty Images\n  The choice of the AR-15 is interesting and sure to turn heads. Although the AR in \u201cAR-15\u201d stands for ArmaLite rifle rather than \u201cassault rifle\u201d, \u201cautomatic riffle\u201d, or \u201ca rifle,\u201d Jonathan Franklin described in an NPR article the AR-15 as designed \u201cto kill people quickly and in large numbers.\u201d The Federal Assault Weapons Ban that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994 did restrict sales of AR-15-style firearms. But since the Ban was lifted in 2004, AR-15s and very similar firearms have been the weapons used for a number of the deadliest mass shootings in American history including the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting, the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting.\n  The introduction of H.R.1095 comes at a time when many Americans have been clamoring for Congress to do more about addressing gun violence. The number of mass shootings in the U.S. per year has steadily grown over the past decade, going from 273 in 2014 to over 600 in each of the last three years. Gun violence left over 44,000 Americans dead last year and already over 6,400 Americans dead less than two months into this year. Meanwhile, a June 2021 Pew Research Poll found that 48% of Americans surveyed \u201csee gun violence as a very big problem in the country today,\u201d and 53% favor stricter gun laws. In Gallup polls over the past three years , the percentage favoring stricter gun sales laws has gone from 52% to 66% to 57%.\n   Rep. Barry Moore (R-Alabama) marked his introduction of H.R. 1095 with a statement that said, \u201cThe ... [+] anti-Second Amendment group won't stop until they take away all your firearms. One rule to remember: any government that would take away one right would take away them all.\u201d (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n  CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n  PLAY\n  Forbes Innovation\n    Video Settings\n  Full Screen\n  About Connatix\n  V233833\n  \u2018The Art Of Demon Slayer' Book Review: A Wonderful\n  Record Of Koyoharu Gotouge's Immense Talent\n  Note that \u201cstricter gun laws\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201ctake away everyone's guns.\u201d Yet, according to Howard Koplowitz writing for AL.com , Moore marked his introduction of H.R. 1095 with a statement that said, \u201cThe anti-Second Amendment group won't stop until they take away all your firearms. One rule to remember: any government that would take away one right would take away them all.\u201d Umm, just because you don't have a right to run naked down a city street singing \u201cHallelujah,\u201d while throwing hot dogs at people doesn't mean that you won't retain your right to run, to eat hot dogs, or to sing the song \u201cHallelujah.\u201d In fact, you are free to be naked, sing \u201cHallelujah,\u201d and throw hot dogs at your mirror, all at the same time. So imposing some restrictions should by no means imply that even more restrictions will necessarily follow. Otherwise, we'd already be in a society where you couldn't do anything, except for maybe buy stuff.\n  Again, the data clearly shows that gun violence is a major problem in the U.S. that's grown over the past decade. The only way to deny that is to somehow suggest that over 44,000 deaths in a year is no big deal. When it comes to gun violence, the U.S. does stand out from much of the world but in a good way. For example, an analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington found that among 64 high-income countries and territories the U.S. has ranked eighth in terms of rates of homicides by firearms with two U.S. territories, \u200bPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, finishing first and third. So, in some ways, the gun may have already become a national symbol for the U.S. to the much of the world.",

    "body": "Editor\u2019s note: Big Tent Ideas always aims to provide balancing perspectives on the hottest issues of the day. Below is a column from Rep. Tony Gonzales arguing that Republicans can improve border security without turning away legitimate asylum-seekers. He opposes HR 29, Rep. Chip Roy\u2019s Border Safety and Security Act. You can find a counterpoint here, where FreedomWorks for America Executive Director Noah Wall argues that Gonzales is undermining Republicans\u2019 efforts to secure the southern border.\n\nThere is no question the Biden Administration has created the worst immigration crisis in U.S. history. Take it from me \u2013 I represent over forty percent of the southern border in Congress.\n\nFor two years since Biden took office, I have seen all angles of this chaos play out on the ground. From Eagle Pass to El Paso, Texas, high-speed smuggling chases, school lockdowns and property break-ins have become a regular occurrence in my district. Through daily conversations with Border Patrol agents, local officials, sheriffs and ranchers, my constituents all tell me the same thing: they need help today. Not tomorrow. Not a month from now. Today.\n\nSo as much as I could spend all day berating Secretary Mayorkas for his open borders agenda (and believe me, I\u2019ve done my fair share), it\u2019s clear by now that grandstanding won\u2019t deliver solutions for my communities \u2013 only actions will. (RELATED: WOLF And LAW: Joe Biden Could Secure The Border Today. Here\u2019s How)\n\nDuring my first term in Congress, I hosted more than 90 of my congressional colleagues at the border. I also introduced legislation to increase penalties on fentanyl traffickers, expand grant funding for law enforcement partnerships and protect Border Patrol agents from being terminated by the COVID vaccine mandate. Recently, I pressured the Administration to reopen a Border Patrol station in Cotulla, Texas, placing 96 more agents on the front lines to defend against the cartels. I also helped appropriate millions of dollars to support our law enforcement with additional manpower, technology, and equipment.\n\nThese are realistic proposals. They translate into substantial results for my constituents. If Congress focused on reaching common ground around issues like these, the border would be better off overnight. Unfortunately, too many of my colleagues prefer to score political points with messaging bills that will never be signed into law.\n\nA perfect example is H.R. 29 \u2014 the \u201cBorder Safety and Security Act.\u201d While the name sounds enticing, this legislation does nothing to fix the root causes of the problems at our border.\n\nH.R. 29 bans people from claiming asylum if they can\u2019t be detained for the entire length of their adjudication. Although it is the law for asylum-seekers to be held in custody, Border Patrol and ICE simply don\u2019t have the space or manpower to house large groups of people over the long-term. Just last week, Rio Grande Valley Chief Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez testified that Border Patrol does \u201cnot have that level of capacity in [their] facilities.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, immigration courts are so backlogged that an asylum case can take up to four years to get resolved. Even under President Trump\u2019s effective border security policies, thousands of asylum seekers were still released from detention because our border system is terribly underequipped and designed to fail.\n\nRather than fixing the underlying problems that lead to \u201ccatch and release,\u201d H.R. 29 would just turn asylum-seekers away, regardless of whether they are fleeing a life-or-death situation. This could include Christians fleeing religious persecution in the Middle East or Ukrainians seeking protection from Russia. Not only is this un-American and inhumane \u2014 it\u2019s just bad policymaking. If we shut off our asylum process at the front door, what makes us think this won\u2019t lead to more human smuggling through our back door?\n\nTo be clear, our asylum system is broken and easily abused. Many claims \u2014 up to 80 percent \u2014 are illegitimate, yet anyone who knows how to pass the \u201ccredible fear\u201d test can be released into the country, sometimes for years on end, until they get their day in court. By then, many won\u2019t show up.\n\nThis is a glaring problem that creates a huge incentive for illegal immigration, but Congress needs to fix it from the ground up. It can do that by adding more immigration judges to the system, investing in Border Patrol resources, and deporting unmerited claimants more quickly. Settling on an all-or-nothing approach like H.R. 29 is not only anti-American, it would just kick the can down the road until another crisis flares up.\n\nHouse Republicans now have the majority. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to show Americans that we can legislate responsibly. My constituents, who actually live along the border, can\u2019t afford any more messaging bills. They need results today, not empty rhetoric like H.R. 29.\n\nTony Gonzales represents Texas\u2019 23rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(emphasis added)\n\nThe Arizona State Senate passed House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 2023 late Tuesday, also in a straight party line vote, 16 to 14, one month after the Arizona House of Representatives passed the resolution in another straight party line vote, 31 to 29.\n\nWhereas, House Resolution 1 (H.R. 1), a bill introduced in the United States Congress, would obliterate the constitutional arrangement between the states and the government of the United States by usurping the constitutional power of states to manage, control and administer state elections by prohibiting various practices and mandating others such as forcing states to conduct an election over an extended period of time,\u00a0prohibiting states from maintaining voter rolls free from error and obsolete information and forcing states to accept an elector who does not register to vote in advance, mandates related to mail voting, prohibitions against regulating ballot harvesting and scores of other intrusions into the power of states to manage, control and administer their elections. And Whereas, the power over elections was preserved explicitly for the states by the Constitution; and Whereas, H.R. 1 strikes at the very heart of the arrangement that gave rise to this nation, namely that states are sovereign and free from interference and the intrusion of power from the government of the United States absent clear constitutional authorization. Therefore, Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona,the Senate concurring: 1. That the Members of the Legislature oppose any attempt by the\u00a0federal government to usurp, or otherwise interfere with, the state legislative sovereign authority over the management, control and administration of elections.\n\n 2. That the Members of the Legislature oppose H.R. 1 and any\u00a0subsequent enactment of the terms of this proposal and implore the Members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate to oppose the same.\n\n\u2026the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a\u00a0copy of this Resolution to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona and each Speaker of the House of Representatives and each President of the Senate of the other state legislatures.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Corrupt Politicians Act\u2019 is the most dangerous piece of legislation to come out of DC in generations. The bill reflects Democrats\u2019 attempt to rig America\u2019s electoral system in their favor and strip voters of their civil right to have their vote matter,\u201d State Rep. Jake Hoffman (R-Queen Creek), primary sponsor of HRC 2023 in the Arizona House, told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThe Arizona legislature stands unwaveringly against the Democrats\u2019 unconstitutional power grab and attempt to federalize our state\u2019s elections process,\u201d Hoffman added.\n\nArizona Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ) added his support for the resolution passed by the Arizona legislature.\n\n\u201cWhile most of the country has some doubt as to the integrity of our elections, the Democrats want to ensure that we never have an honest election again. If we do not stop H.R. 1, it will become increasingly difficult to restore trust in American elections,\u201d Biggs said in a statement released by State Rep. Hoffman\u2019s office.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2018\n\n\u201cThe Constitution delegates the power over elections to the legislature and we intend to fiercely oppose any effort by corrupt politicians in Washington, DC, to interfere with our sovereign authority,\u201d Hoffman added in that statement.",

Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right His colleague Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), appearing on ABC's \u201cThis Week,\u201d dodged rather than condemned: \u201cI don't know the details,\u201d he said, after days of the law making headlines around the country. In a more rational world, a provision like that would make legislators rethink their support for the whole bill, which would further restrict Georgians' voting rights. Not in today's GOP, though. \u201cIn Georgia, you had an explosion of mail-in balloting,\u201d Graham argued in defending the law's new limits on absentee and mail ballots. \u201cThe Carter-Baker Commission in 2005 looked at our election system and they had two warnings for us. Absentee mail voting is ripe for fraud, and ballot harvesting, where an individual can collect ballots on behalf of other people, is a threat to democracy as we know it.\u201d Note that Graham had to go back to a 2005 commission report rather than cite specific instances of widespread fraud \u2014 because they don't exist. On NBC's \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) was even more forthright: \u201cYou look at the Georgia law, there's no voter suppression. \u2026 All you need [to vote absentee] is some, some verification of ID, and so does every department of transportation in America in order to drive.\u201d That is supposed common sense, except for two problems: First, we have the right to vote; no one has the right to drive. So it should be easier to vote than it is to drive. Second, these tighter ID requirements will make it more difficult for poor and minority voters to vote, all in the name of rooting out alleged fraud, which Georgia Republicans such as Gov. Brian Kemp have admitted is nonexistent Even more outlandish were these senators' claims about H.R. 1, the voting rights expansion just passed by the House and now before the Senate. \u201cH.R. 1 is the biggest power grab in the history of the country. It institutionalizes ballot harvesting. It does away with the voter ID requirement,\u201d Graham said. As for Toomey, he said of H.R. 1, \u201cWe ought to be asking our Democratic colleagues: Why are they so insistent that we not have any mechanism to verify that a person seeking to vote is, in fact, the person that they say they are?\u201d And on Fox News's \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) topped all his colleagues: \u201cDemocrats think we'd be better off if more murderers and rapists and child molesters were voting.\u201d Not surprisingly, every one of these tales is false. H.R. 1 can't institutionalize fraudulent \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 where political operatives tamper with collected absentee ballots \u2014 because it doesn't exist . (The closest similar incident, in 2018, actually involved a Republican in North Carolina.) Nor does it do away with voter ID laws; it just allows voters to provide a sworn written statement in place of ID , a system already used successfully in a number of states. (It's also worth noting that more than a dozen states \u2014 including red states such as Wyoming and Nebraska \u2014 have no voter ID requirements.) And as usual, Cruz's claim is the biggest whopper. The bill would restore voting rights to anyone convicted of a crime only after they have served their sentence \u2014 equal to or tougher than the standard already used in much of the country , including Cruz's home state of Texas. Any truly democratic system should make it as easy as possible to exercise one's right to vote while maintaining the system's integrity. H.R. 1 understands that we've succeeded remarkably well on the latter count, and focuses instead on the former, by reducing restrictions that have no practical effect except making it more difficult for some Americans to vote. The question is whether there are 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus who recognize the importance of this remedy. Most otherwise pro-filibuster senators, such as Angus King (I-Maine), realize that \u201call-out opposition to reasonable voting rights protections cannot be enabled by the filibuster.\u201d But Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) continues to insist that he'll need bipartisan support before he will back the whole bill, leaving it one vote short. In the short term, other Democrats can still indulge Manchin's naivete and expand voting rights. While H.R. 1 is up in the air, the Senate is also considering House-passed legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, which was renewed numerous times on a bipartisan basis until a conservative Supreme Court gutted it in 2013. If, as one suspects, Republicans now declare the Voting Rights Act a partisan horror, perhaps the scales will fall from the West Virginian's eyes. But in the longer term, Democrats must, perversely, take heart from the size of the GOP's distortions. That Republicans' excuses for inaction are (even by GOP standards) so thin shows the scale of the problem; that they are so panicked about H.R. 1 bodes well for its effectiveness when finally passed.

But court picking poses a real threat to Americans\u2019 rights.\n\nCourt picking is when Congress uses its authority over federal-court jurisdiction to stuff politically sensitive cases from throughout the country into one court that leans its way, to be buried there for as long as possible. Court-picking\u2019s evil genius is its stealth. Americans would notice four new justices, but not changes to technocratic statutes that excite only civil-procedure professors. Despite featuring in Congress\u2019s most radioactive bill\u2014the so-called For the People Act, or H.R.1, which would transform elections and limit Americans\u2019 rights to speak about them\u2014court-picking has escaped notice.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t. H.R.1\u2019s court-picking provision would shut courthouse doors throughout the country, attempt to game the outcome in critical cases, deny the Supreme Court the benefit of the federal judiciary\u2019s broad and diverse perspectives, and repeal measures that expedite important lawsuits questioning government power.\n\nIn one neat court-picking trick, the bill would strip 93 of 94 local federal district courts, and 11 of the 12 regional appellate courts that review their decisions, of their power to hear First Amendment challenges to Congress\u2019s regulation of political speech.

Imagine if Republicans had passed a voting-rights bill that forced Californians wishing to challenge it to sue in Louisiana, and appeal to some of the country\u2019s most conservative judges.\n\nSome complex and discrete legal fields are best assigned to specialized courts. The D.C. Circuit has some unique authority to review administrative cases involving federal agencies, and Congress created the Federal Circuit in 1982 to hear appeals in patent cases nationwide. But all federal judges should be conversant in the Constitution, and Washington-based judges are no better than those elsewhere at interpreting the First Amendment.",

    "body": "Through the near-miraculous success of vaccines at ending the coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019s clear that medical innovation both saves and improves lives. Yet many leading congressional Democrats are pushing a deeply flawed bill that will harm patients by undermining the very innovation that delivered multiple safe and effective vaccines in record time.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThis bill, H.R. 3, would give the federal bureaucracy unprecedented power to set prices for prescription drugs. Rather than pursuing this measure, Congress should work toward common-sense reforms that have broad support and will ensure continued access to life-saving and life-enhancing medications.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the problems with H.R. 3, look to the experience of countries where the government sets drug prices. While price controls might reduce the sticker price of a drug, patients in these countries suffer from drug shortages and restricted access to treatments.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in Canada, where a government board determines drug prices, patients only have access to half of new drugs. In contrast, US patients have access to 89 percent of new drugs.\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, European Union countries with price controls have experienced worsening drug shortages. The low prices limit production of the drug and what is available for patients. According to a 2019 report, in France, \u201cThe number of drugs reported as scarce in the country increased 20-fold between 2008 and 2018, according to the country\u2019s drugs regulator \u2014 and is predicted to rise by a further 60 percent this year.\u201d In Italy, some cancer patients struggle to access medications. In Poland, the shortage of neurological drugs rose to an \u201cunprecedented scale.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPrice controls will slash the number of new medications by limiting the returns on innovation. A 2019 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimated that H.R. 3 would reduce the number of new treatments by one-third over 10 years. According to the CEA, H.R. 3 would reduce average American life expectancy by about four months and have total economic costs that far exceed the benefits from lower prices.\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats are pushing a flawed bill that will harm patients by undermining the very innovation that delivered multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time.Matthew McDermott\n\n\n\nOver the past few decades, pharmaceutical innovation has produced breakthrough drugs in the treatment of many diseases, like heart disease, HIV and hepatitis C. These treatments significantly improved and extended life. Medical researchers are currently making strides in the treatment of other diseases, like cancer. The last thing policymakers should do is smother medical innovation and limit new discoveries with bigger government.\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, Congress can take steps to expand patient access to more affordable medications in ways that won\u2019t have such severe side effects.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFirst, Congress should make it easier for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to quickly approve safe generics and also make it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to game the patent system to limit competition from generics. Increasing the availability of generics would be especially helpful for fixed-income seniors, people with low incomes, and individuals with preexisting conditions who need medication.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCongress should also reform the FDA approval process to grant automatic approval to medications authorized in other countries with regulatory processes we trust. In some cases, Americans waited years for drugs already benefiting patients in Japan and other countries with robust screens for safety.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Congress should allow all Americans to open tax-free health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs would let patients use some of their pre-tax income to cover prescription drug costs, such as copays.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAduhelm, the FDA-approved drug that could slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, is expensive \u2014 but market competition will lower the price of such treatment over time.Reuters\n\n\n\nUnderstandably, there is concern about the launch price of Aduhelm, the recently FDA-approved drug that may be beneficial to slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s. As a result of Medicare\u2019s design, which needs significant reform, the federal government simply reimburses the price set by the manufacturer. For Aduhelm, this price is $56,000 per year. Of course, the ravages of this disease are extremely high and over time, market competition will lower the price of such treatment. Already, a second drugmaker has filed for accelerated approval of its Alzheimer\u2019s treatment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical innovation is one of the best features of America\u2019s health-care system. Nearly 60 percent of new drugs are produced in the United States, and Americans typically enjoy the world\u2019s best access to new medications. Congress should not take action that would imperil this innovation and the life-enhancing and life-saving products that result. Fortunately, there are many actions that Congress can take to bring down the prices of drugs by reducing regulatory barriers and promoting market competition. And unlike H.R. 3, these reforms will have bipartisan support.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBrian Blase served as a special assistant to President Trump at the National Economic Council, 2017-19.

    "body": "Skip Sanzeri is the founder, board chair and COO of QuSecure, a top post-quantum cybersecurity company.\nOn December 21, 2022, President Biden signed into law H.R.7535, the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act, which encourages \u201cfederal government agencies to adopt technology that will protect against quantum computing attacks.\u201d\n  This marks a major milestone in the global effort to develop and deploy quantum-resilient cybersecurity. It\u2019s important that the U.S. moves quickly against the coming quantum computing threat since it takes significant effort and years to upgrade existing federal and commercial technology and cryptography. Meanwhile, quantum computers are rapidly developing, with some adversarial nation-states putting tens of billions of dollars toward programs to create these very powerful machines which will break the encryption we use today.\n  The Act  H.R.7535 requires federal agencies to \u201cmigrate systems to post-quantum cryptography, which is resilient against attacks from quantum computers and standard computers.\u201d To illustrate the bullish progress our federal representatives have made, H.R.7535 follows three major initiatives from earlier last year outlining how we should create a quantum-resilient U.S.\n  1. On January 19, 2022, the State Department issued a key initiative called the \u201cMemorandum on Improving the Cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense, and Intelligence Community Systems,\u201d stating that \u201cWithin 180 days of the date of this memorandum, agencies shall identify any instances of encryption not in compliance with NSA-approved Quantum Resistant Algorithms.\u201d\n  2. On May 4, 2022, the State Department published a follow-on memo called the\n  National Security Memorandum 10 (NSM-10), \u201cPromoting United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems.\u201d\n  3. On November 18, 2022, M-23-02 was issued from Shalanda D. Young, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. This memorandum describes steps for federal agencies to take as they transition to Post-Quantum Cybersecurity (PQC) by building a prioritized inventory of their cryptographic systems.\n  H.R.7535 now codifies that within six months, federal agencies must develop a strategy for migrating to post-quantum cryptography. In addition, it compels federal agencies to address the risk posed by weakened encryption due to the capability of a quantum computer to breach that encryption. Within 180 days of the memo (by May of 2023), the law outlines a requirement for \u201ceach agency to establish and maintain a current inventory of information technology in use by the agency that is vulnerable to decryption by quantum computers.\u201d\n  Most importantly, this new law has funding attached as it requires each agency to submit an estimate of the amount of money it will take for the move to quantum-safe systems.\n  What are quantum computers?  Quantum computers are very powerful machines that operate differently than the standard computers we use today. Standard computers struggle with certain sets of problems, one of which happens to be the base of the current cryptography that currently protects our data. The data that makes up this article and the internet it traveled across uses encryption protected by a mathematical equation using large numbers and the factors that go into those numbers. Also called prime factorization, this math problem is unbelievably difficult for classical computers to solve.\n  Quantum computers operate differently. Using a subatomic property called superposition, quantum computers can process problems like prime factorization and multivariate problems due to how they process data and the way they can be programmed. Unlike our classical computers, where the base elements must be zero or one, superposition allows quantum computers to take advantage of a base element being zero, one and anything in between, all at the same time.\n  Why do we need to act now?  It is widely understood that adversarial nation-states are building quantum computers to use as weapons. To put it as clearly as possible, the first nefarious nation-state that brings a quantum computer online with enough power to crack encryption could have unprecedented global control at its fingertips. All the private and secret information traveling over the internet will be available to anyone who has this power. This includes national secrets, healthcare data, financial and banking information, as well as access to infrastructure like energy grids, satellite communications and water supplies.\n  Worse yet, it is heavily documented that some nations are stealing vast amounts of data that is currently encrypted but will be decrypted when a quantum computer with enough power is available. Sometimes called \u201cSteal Now, Decrypt Later\u201d (SNDL), this describes stealing and storing data for a future date when there are systems that can decrypt, view and operationalize that data.\n  Most of these data sets need to remain secret for 25 to 75 years and would be valuable if cracked sooner. But if stolen now and decrypted within a few years by a quantum computer, an adversary would then have the capability to operationalize that data to disrupt society, steal intellectual property, gain financially or increase the chances of winning a war.\n  What can be done?  Most government agencies and commercial enterprises will need to take three main steps to prepare their digital infrastructure for quantum-resilient cybersecurity.\n  1. Start by evaluating and documenting current cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks.\n  2. Develop a plan to add quantum-safe cryptography where appropriate in your network, including servers, edge devices and IoT.\n  3. Test a quantum-safe, cryptographically agile solution in your IT infrastructure.\n  Selecting suitable cryptographic algorithms can be done quickly with help from a qualified consultant or vendor. However, deploying a quantum-safe security solution will take longer, depending on the size and complexity of your enterprise network.\n  According to Congressman Ro Khanna, who sponsored H.R.7535, \u201cAs quantum computing continues to progress, we must take steps now to protect America\u2019s national security and economy\u2026we have to plan ahead for potential vulnerabilities it may create.\u201d\n  It is imperative that we continue this rapid progress toward a quantum-resilient technology in the U.S. as outlined by H.R.7535 so that when (not if) a bad actor has access to sufficient quantum computing power, our data, communications, systems and future will be protected.\n  Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Although they prefer that he not run again , a recent Des Moines Register-Mediacom poll showed him crushing Democratic front-runner Abby Finkenauer, a former one-term House member, should they match up in November 2022. Older Iowans hear the ghost of H.R. Gross wailing from the fields of dry corn. Long ago, Harold Royce Gross was a noted congressman from northeast Iowa whose political philosophy was: cheap . Gross opposed the Vietnam War because it was too expensive. He even opposed the eternal flame at JFK's grave for its perpetual fuel cost. His wife, Hazel, ran his office for no pay. He cast a dim brow toward the grain trade and the meatpackers, and otherwise sought to protect the taxpayer from Washington. Gerald Ford once said America had three political parties: Republicans, Democrats and H.R. Gross. Gross shaped young Charles E. Grassley, who was smart enough to recognize a message that would get him off the farm and the factory floors around Waterloo. Frugal is as Iowa as black dirt. After 16 years in the Iowa Capitol, Grassley assumed Gross's seat in the House in 1975, where he began complaining, much as Gross had done, about the Pentagon's $600 toilet seats and $400 hammers, and kept at it when he moved to the Senate in 1981. We called him a \u201cmaverick\u201d because he bucked the military-industrial complex \u2014 but then Iowa has no major military bases. He championed corn ethanol and wind turbines from the Senate Finance Committee. He was aw-shucks Chuck, and he threshed most of his challengers with ease, often with ads that showed him tugging two mowers across his farm yard in stereo. Grassley might think he still walks in Gross's footsteps, but the truth is that he strayed far from the farm as he climbed the ladder of power. He has written enough letters to fill a book complaining about weak antitrust laws and meatpacking. But gather the votes to do something to stop it? He'd rather just fire up his typewriter for another letter. When the Trump administration shut down the stockyards inspection administration, Grassley did nothing. You didn't hear a peep when President Donald Trump ordered immigrant meat cutters onto the kill floor , shoulder to shoulder, without coronavirus testing or proper personal protective equipment, to maintain the brittle meat supply chain that tottered in the spring of 2020. He chaired the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee as the rich claimed theirs. He and then-Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) holed up in a room to weaken the legs of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that upstart health insurance cooperatives would be starved of funding. From the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley has served as Sen. Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) chief acolyte, denying President Barack Obama his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Grassley has tasted power, and prefers it to a pork chop on a stick. Grassley likes it when you call him the \u201c father of the wind energy production tax credit ,\u201d which has helped the wind farm business, but he won't make the credit permanent. He tells us that you can't deport 10 million undocumented people, but vows he will not allow \u201c mass amnesty .\u201d He went along with all the wars that H.R. Gross would have starved in their cradles. Grassley says he favors term limits . Except for himself. If elected, he will be 89 when he is sworn in to an eighth term. One Iowa parlor game is to play out what is really going on here. It could be dynastic: Grassley presumably wins next year, as does Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has a 55 percent approval rating. Grassley might hang around a while, then retire to his New Hartford farm, allowing Reynolds to appoint Chuck's grandson, Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley, to replace him. Grassley the Younger is chiseled from the same stone but rolls farther right. But then, these days, so does Iowa. Grassley the Elder isn't speculating. He's running. You have to think that he is going the distance. He still jogs every morning. I wonder what H.R. Gross would think. He hung it up after 26 years and watched pro wrestling. You would think that our senior senator, after 63 years in elected office, might have accomplished what he set out to do in the first place \u2014 if anyone can remember what that was.",

    "body": "prices in the East Room of the White House complex on Thursday, Aug. 12, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) For years, reducing prescription drug costs has been a policy goal of (mostly Democratic) legislators at the federal and state levels. And, in a break with past Republican Administrations, former President Trump vociferously criticized rising drug prices. His Administration forged ahead with proposals aimed at overhauling parts of the system of drug pricing in the U.S. These include requiring pass-through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to Medicare beneficiaries at the pharmacy counter, and pegging the prices of Medicare Part B (physician-administered) drugs to what is paid internationally. While most of these initiatives failed to get off the ground, they did help to invigorate an ongoing national discussion. The election of President Biden, together with a Democratic majority in the House and a 50-50 split in the Senate - with Vice President Harris being the deciding vote - appear to provide a boost to the chances of successful reform efforts. Nonetheless, Democrats eager to lower prescription drug prices face obstacles that may dim prospects of meaningful change. These run the gamut from limitations on what the executive branch can do, a razor-thin majority in Congress, and doubts expressed by key centrists in the Democratic Party. Biden's executive order In an executive order issued in early July, President Biden gave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 45 days to submit a report to the Assistant to the President. The report is to include a \u201ccomprehensive plan ... to combat high prescription drug prices and price gouging.\u201d At the time of writing \u2013 September 6th \u2013 nothing is publicly available about this report. Perhaps it is being reviewed by the Assistant to the President, and it will subsequently be released to the public. The plan is supposed to produce the clearest picture yet of what the Biden Administration will attempt to do to lower drug prices. It's probable the report includes certain regulations on promoting prescription drug competition which HHS can pursue without legislation; for example, banning pay for delay schemes that impede generic entry into the market. However, other, more direct ways to reduce drug prices, may not be feasible without Congress. For example, according to the July executive order, Biden supports a legislative change to the non-interference clause that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Specifically, Medicare would be able to negotiate the price of certain high-cost drugs that have little or no competition. The Biden Administration has even intimated that it would like to see a ceiling set for the launch prices of single source (branded) outpatient (Part D) drugs by referencing the average price of these pharmaceuticals in other developed countries. Further, the Biden Administration has hinted at Medicare establishing an independent entity to evaluate new medical technologies, such as drugs which face inadequate or no competition, or pharmaceuticals which launch at high prices that may not be justified based on their clinical value. Such an entity's remit would be to determine what constitutes a fair price for each of the high-cost drugs alluded to. Also, to curb the cycle of perpetual (list) price hikes on Part D (outpatient) drugs which in turn increase Medicare beneficiary out-of-pocket costs, the Biden Administration has signaled that it believes an effective remedy may be to hand out penalties to companies that raise their prices faster than inflation. Additionally, Biden has recommended imposing an annual cap on the amount that Medicare beneficiaries pay out-of-pocket for prescription drugs. Nevertheless, the Administration has not outlined a specific process for either Medicare drug price negotiation, the creation of an assessment entity with power to influence public sector prices, or changes to Medicare Part D benefit design, leaving it up to Congress to sort out the details, including alterations to existing laws that only the legislative branch can amend. Working with Congress It's likely, therefore, that the pending White House report will attempt to tie in elements already contained in various proposals circulating in the House and Senate. These include H.R.3 (Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act), S.2543 (Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019), Senator Wyden's outline of proposed drug pricing reforms, and the budget reconciliation bill. The $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill hasn't yet been finalized. But, in all likelihood it will contain a prescription drug pricing component. Ostensibly, this feature would yield cost savings that could be used together with tax increases to finance other items in the bill, such as measures to support action on climate change. On drug pricing, the bill could borrow from both H.R.3 and S.2543. The H.R.3 proposed legislation, for example, establishes a provision which allows Medicare to negotiate the prices of certain existing drugs in Medicare Parts B (physician-administered) and D (outpatient), based on international benchmarks. Moreover, newly launched drugs with a projected high impact on Medicare spending would be subject to international price referencing if their list price is greater than the median household income. The S.2543 proposal includes inflationary rebates for drug price increases that exceed inflation. If list prices for brand-name pharmaceuticals covered under Part B increase faster than the rate of inflation, manufacturers would be required to pay the difference in the form of a rebate to Medicare. Under budget reconciliation, bills can pass the Senate with merely a simple majority rather than 60 plus votes. Indeed, Republicans used this process in 2017 to pass tax cuts. Possible roadblocks There's considerable uncertainty regarding passage with a simple majority of the 2021 massive budget reconciliation bill. Last week, Senator Joe Manchin called on Democrats to pause pushing forward the budget reconciliation bill. If Manchin winds up saying no to the bill, this would scuttle it as the Democrats can't afford to lose a single Senator. And, there's speculation that provisions to reduce prescription drug prices may be watered down and not incorporate international price referencing . Additionally, reduced prices derived through Medicare negotiation may not be able to be applied to those with employer-based coverage. While the progressive wing of the Democratic Party supports drug pricing reform, several key centrist Democrats in both the House and Senate appear to be uncomfortable with particular aspects of the budget reconciliation bill, including a potential deal-breaker, namely the potential negative impact of drug price controls on the domestic pharmaceutical industry, as well as long-term patient access to new drugs. A paper released in 2019 by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the proposed legislation, H.R. 3, would reduce global revenue for new drugs by 19%, leading to 8 fewer drugs approved in the U.S. between 2020 and 2029, and 30 fewer drugs over the next decade. And, a new report from the CBO reinforces the message that drug pricing legislation under consideration in Congress could lead to fewer new drugs being developed and launched. Intense lobbying efforts from biopharmaceutical industry groups are underway, warning of what they deem are harms from price controls in the form of diminished patient access to new innovations. The argument, based in part on assumptions and modeling included in the CBO reports, asserts that price controls would dampen investment critical to the biopharmaceutical industry's pipeline of drugs and biologics. This won't sway most Democrats, but has been a traditional talking point in the Republican Party for decades, and may convince some centrist Democrats to withdraw backing of provisions that in their eyes stymie pharmaceutical innovation. If the budget reconciliation bill would fail to garner a majority, a pared down version of H.R. 3, or perhaps a new bill altogether, with Senator Wyden spearheading the effort, could eventually land in the Senate. But, a similar set of provisos would apply, as majority support in both chambers would be far from a sure thing. In brief, Democrats' plans at both the executive and legislative branch levels to introduce prescription drug pricing reform encounter challenges which may prevent impactful modifications from taking place.

    "body": "It was only a matter of time. We knew it was coming \u2013 gun control.\n Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has long advocated for limits on the right of citizens to own guns, so has Speaker Nancy Pelosi; and Vice President Kamala Harris always has been a cheerleader for gun control. Who can forget then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in 2020 publicly declaring he might, if elected, make extreme gun control advocate \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke his \u201cgun czar.\u201d\n The waiting is over. The battle for the Second Amendment is underway in earnest, and the GOP had better be prepared to do serious battle or they (and the American people) will have their constitutional pocket picked clean.\n Last week, House Democrats sent two bills to the Senate. Measures that enthrall the gun control crowd, not by making it more difficult for criminals to obtain firearms but by making it significantly harder for law-abiding citizens to purchase guns for self-defense or other lawful purposes.\n   Both bills \u2014 H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 \u2013 come with the time-worn gun control label as \u201ccommon sense\u201d measures designed solely to close \u201cloopholes\u201d in the National Instant Background Check System. While the \u201cNICS\u201d system has not worked perfectly (what federal program has?), it has served surprisingly well for more than two decades at preventing sales of firearms to individuals prohibited by law from possessing them. Regardless, gun control advocates have been looking for ways to expand it ever since it was first passed by Congress in 1993.\n In fact, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 are benign \u201creform\u201d measures.\n H.R. 1446, the \u201cEnhanced Background Checks Act of 2021,\u201d is the more insidious of the pair. While pretending to do nothing more than extend the current legal time period available for the FBI (which administers NICS) to deny a proposed firearm sale from three business days to 10, its actual result would be to extend such time period for up to one month or more. During that time, a lawful applicant might remain defenseless against a stalker, deranged ex-spouse or another threatening individual.\n Before NICS was passed in 1993, the Congress recognized that unless there was a strict time limit for gun purchase approvals, federal bureaucrats could \u201cslow walk\u201d applicants indefinitely; thus, the three-business day limit after which a gun retailer could legally complete the gun purchase even if not yet formally okayed by the FBI. However, in the latest move by the House, that bureaucratic \u201csafe harbor\u201d would extend far longer, possibly indefinitely. The result would be to significantly if not fatally undermine the ability of many gun purchasers to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right perhaps when they need it most.\n The companion bill passing the House last week, H.R. 8, the \u201cBipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021,\u201d is the Holy Grail of the gun control movement \u2013 Universal Background Checks. The intent of this bill, unlike the more opaque H.R. 1446, is clear. It would, with few exceptions (such as some gifts from one spouse to the other spouse) require that private transfers of firearms must fully comply with the same NICS process with which all sales from a licensed gun dealer now must comply.\n \n The blind spot in all this is the \u201ccommon sense\u201d fact that these new procedures (which had been considered and rejected as overly broad and constitutionally problematic when considered by the Congress 28 years ago) will not stop individuals intent on obtaining and using firearms for unlawful purposes.\n Even as the Congress now is fast-tracking the legislative gun control agenda, Biden appears ready to start using executive powers with the same goal in mind. One measure apparently under active consideration would be to return control over lawful export of firearms back to the bureaucratically heavy and liberally minded State Department, and strip the power from the Commerce Department where Trump had set it\n All this is but a taste of what is certain to come in the months ahead as Pelosi, Schumer, and Harris busy themselves with directing steps to carry out Biden\u2019s well-known desire to strip law-abiding citizens and businesses of ways by which they are able to exercise their Second Amendment rights. \u00a0If the Republican Party and its representatives in the Congress fail to articulate clearly what such measures will really do, and if they fail to vigorously fight against all such measures, when the dust settles before the 2022 elections, our Second Amendment will emerge as but a skeleton of its intended and former self.\n Bob Barr represented Georgia\u2019s Seventh District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003.

The suspect of the shooting was captured by police and led out of the crime scene with a bloodied leg.\nFollowing the tragedy, many prominent Democrats called for more gun control legislation online, with several eyeing an end to the filibuster to push measures through.\n\"It is long past time for those with the power to fight this epidemic of gun violence to do so. It will take time to root out the disaffection, racism and misogyny that fuels so many of these senseless acts of violence,\" former President Barack Obama said in a statement Tuesday.\u00a0\n\"But we can make it harder for those with hate in their hearts to buy weapons of war.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, N.Y., vowed the Democrats would bring it to the Senate floor for a vote.\nSchumer doubled down on his plan while speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday, maintaining he would hold a vote on H.R. 8.\n\"The Senate is going to debate and address the epidemic of gun violence in this country,\" Schumer said.\nCOLORADO REP.

Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) announced in separate statements on Tuesday that they would vote against the section of Democrats' $3.5 trillion package dealing with lowering drug prices during a markup in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is currently ongoing. The committee has not yet turned to the drug pricing section, but if all three lawmakers stick to their statements and vote no, it would be enough to defeat that section, given that all Republicans are also expected to vote no. All three lawmakers last week put forward scaled-back, rival drug pricing legislation that they said would \"preserve innovation\" and could gain bipartisan support. The pharmaceutical industry has attacked the drug pricing bill backed by Democratic leaders, known as H.R. 3, as threatening innovation from drug companies. \"We need to be serious about how to address this issue by ensuring we champion legislation with broadly supported policies that have the bipartisan, bicameral backing needed to pass Congress,\" Schrader said in a statement. \"I do not believe the drug pricing provision before the Energy and Commerce Committee today will meet this goal and succeed in the Senate, so I cannot vote in favor of the title.\" He said he would engage \"in continued conversations with my colleagues\" about the path forward. A spokesperson for the House Energy and Commerce Committee did not provide specifics on the path forward. \"Democrats are committed to leveling the playing field and reining in the soaring cost of prescription drug prices for the American people,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Energy and Commerce markup of the Build Back Better Act is ongoing and the Chairman continues to work to favorably report out all of the Committee's reconciliation legislative recommendations.\" H.R. 3, would allow the Health and Human Services secretary to negotiate lower drug prices, a long-held Democratic goal. It would also cap drug prices based on prices paid in other wealthy countries. David Mitchell, founder of the advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, said Peters, Rice and Schrader are \"doing the bidding of Big Pharma.\" He noted that Democratic leaders can add drug pricing back into the package after it advances from another House panel, the Ways and Means Committee, this week. \"Big Pharma will spend, do, and say whatever it takes to defeat any legislation that will curb its unilateral power to dictate prices of prescription drugs,\" Mitchell said. \"We know the industry is all over Capitol Hill with an army of lobbyists who are twisting arms, making campaign contributions, issuing threats, and spreading lies. And in the end, they will fail.\" While the moderates are flexing their muscles in the House, the drug pricing provisions were already expected to be changed before the final version of the $3.5 trillion package, given that Senate Democratic moderates also have concerns. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is working on his own drug pricing legislation, which is expected to be less far-reaching than H.R. 3, though the details are not yet finalized. The troubles in the House, though, are a setback for moving the issue forward and illustrate the divisions within the party. Updated at 3:37 p.m.",

    "body": "His colleague Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), appearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d dodged rather than condemned: \u201cI don\u2019t know the details,\u201d he said, after days of the law making headlines around the country.\n\nIn a more rational world, a provision like that would make legislators rethink their support for the whole bill, which would further restrict Georgians\u2019 voting rights. Not in today\u2019s GOP, though.\n\n\u201cIn Georgia, you had an explosion of mail-in balloting,\u201d Graham argued in defending the law\u2019s new limits on absentee and mail ballots. \u201cThe Carter-Baker Commission in 2005 looked at our election system and they had two warnings for us. Absentee mail voting is ripe for fraud, and ballot harvesting, where an individual can collect ballots on behalf of other people, is a threat to democracy as we know it.\u201d\n\nNote that Graham had to go back to a 2005 commission report rather than cite specific instances of widespread fraud \u2014 because they don\u2019t exist.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) was even more forthright: \u201cYou look at the Georgia law, there\u2019s no voter suppression. \u2026 All you need [to vote absentee] is some, some verification of ID, and so does every department of transportation in America in order to drive.\u201d\n\nThat is supposed common sense, except for two problems: First, we have the right to vote; no one has the right to drive. So it should be easier to vote than it is to drive. Second, these tighter ID requirements will make it more difficult for poor and minority voters to vote, all in the name of rooting out alleged fraud, which Georgia Republicans such as Gov. Brian Kemp have admitted is nonexistent.\n\nEven more outlandish were these senators\u2019 claims about H.R. 1, the voting rights expansion just passed by the House and now before the Senate. \u201cH.R. 1 is the biggest power grab in the history of the country. It institutionalizes ballot harvesting. It does away with the voter ID requirement,\u201d Graham said.\n\nAs for Toomey, he said of H.R. 1, \u201cWe ought to be asking our Democratic colleagues: Why are they so insistent that we not have any mechanism to verify that a person seeking to vote is, in fact, the person that they say they are?\u201d\n\nAnd on Fox News\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) topped all his colleagues: \u201cDemocrats think we\u2019d be better off if more murderers and rapists and child molesters were voting.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, every one of these tales is false. H.R. 1 can\u2019t institutionalize fraudulent \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 where political operatives tamper with collected absentee ballots \u2014 because it doesn\u2019t exist. (The closest similar incident, in 2018, actually involved a Republican in North Carolina.) Nor does it do away with voter ID laws; it just allows voters to provide a sworn written statement in place of ID, a system already used successfully in a number of states. (It\u2019s also worth noting that more than a dozen states \u2014 including red states such as Wyoming and Nebraska \u2014 have no voter ID requirements.)\n\nAnd as usual, Cruz\u2019s claim is the biggest whopper. The bill would restore voting rights to anyone convicted of a crime only after they have served their sentence \u2014 equal to or tougher than the standard already used in much of the country, including Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas.\n\nAny truly democratic system should make it as easy as possible to exercise one\u2019s right to vote while maintaining the system\u2019s integrity. H.R. 1 understands that we\u2019ve succeeded remarkably well on the latter count, and focuses instead on the former, by reducing restrictions that have no practical effect except making it more difficult for some Americans to vote.\n\nThe question is whether there are 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus who recognize the importance of this remedy. Most otherwise pro-filibuster senators, such as Angus King (I-Maine), realize that \u201call-out opposition to reasonable voting rights protections cannot be enabled by the filibuster.\u201d But Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) continues to insist that he\u2019ll need bipartisan support before he will back the whole bill, leaving it one vote short.\n\nIn the short term, other Democrats can still indulge Manchin\u2019s naivete and expand voting rights. While H.R. 1 is up in the air, the Senate is also considering House-passed legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, which was renewed numerous times on a bipartisan basis until a conservative Supreme Court gutted it in 2013.\n\nIf, as one suspects, Republicans now declare the Voting Rights Act a partisan horror, perhaps the scales will fall from the West Virginian\u2019s eyes. But in the longer term, Democrats must, perversely, take heart from the size of the GOP\u2019s distortions. That Republicans\u2019 excuses for inaction are (even by GOP standards) so thin shows the scale of the problem; that they are so panicked about H.R. 1 bodes well for its effectiveness when finally passed. The battle for voting rights is long, but it is well worth winning.",

Each year, millions of elderly Americans fall victim to some form of financial exploitation. These schemes are often carried out by perpetrators soliciting payments through mail, over the phone, and online. The FBI estimates that nearly $3 billion is lost annually due to elder fraud and scams, and that number is rising rapidly.\n\n\u201cOur senior citizens are the backbone of our society, and they don\u2019t deserve to be the targets of heinous financial exploitation scams,\u201d\u00a0said Attorney General Bonta.\u00a0\u201cI am committed to protecting our beloved elders from all forms of abuse, which is why I am urging Congress today to pass H.R. 1215. This bill will help combat the financial abuse of senior citizens through the implementation of educational efforts, as well as the monitoring of emerging frauds and scams.\u201d\n\nComprised of both the Stop Senior Scams Act and the Seniors Fraud Prevention Act of 2021, H.R. 1215 would establish a Senior Scam Prevention Advisory Group that would report to the Federal Trade Commission. The advisory group would be required to gather and distribute informational materials for retailers, financial services, and wire-transfer companies that educate those industries on how to better identify and prevent elder fraud and financial abuse.\n\nThe bill would also establish the Office for the Prevention of Fraud Targeting Seniors within the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. This new office would work in cooperation with other federal agencies and state attorneys general to monitor emerging fraud schemes that target seniors, disseminate information on common fraud schemes, and share information on how to report such activity to the national hotline and the Commission\u2019s Consumer Sentinel Network. The Federal Trade Commission would also work with state attorneys general to log and track complaints from victims and coordinate with the appropriate law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn sending today\u2019s letter, Attorney General Bonta joins the attorneys general of\u00a0Florida,\u00a0New York, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico.\n\nA copy of the letter can be found\u00a0here.",

    "body": "The bill also cavalierly opens the door to voting fraud in its treatment of mail balloting. It would expressly permit a person to collect mail ballots and deliver them to the relevant election agency. It purports to limit this to already sealed ballots, but of course it would be almost impossible to prove a ballot was sealed when it was handed off. The most recent proved instance of mass voter fraud involved exactly this procedure, when a Republican operative cast fraudulent votes for candidates who paid him by collecting unsealed mail ballots from voters and then filling them out for the preferred person. H.R.1 would make it much likelier that unscrupulous operatives of both parties could try to use this scheme to tip the scales in their favor.\n\nH.R. 1 also makes it virtually impossible for a state to ensure that even a mail ballot sent directly was cast by the person it purports to be from. It bars any state from requiring identification for a mail ballot and also prohibits states from requiring that a ballot be notarized or witnessed. Without either requirement, matching a signature on a ballot with that on a voter-registration card is the only safeguard against a person casting a vote for someone else. That\u2019s a very thin reed to rely on, especially because the people who verify mail ballots will likely be lenient in their application of this standard in order not to deny a truly eligible person their right to vote.\n\nThe measure also disables other possible ways in which election integrity could be assured. It prevents states, for example, from requiring more than the last four digits of a person\u2019s Social Security number on a registration form. That theoretically opens the floodgates for undocumented immigrants who have illegally obtained SSNs, especially when combined with the requirement that certain state agencies automatically register people as voters when they come into any contact with the system. States are also prevented from removing registered voters from the rolls when a piece of mail is returned as non-deliverable and are required to provide at least 15 days of in-person early voting for federal elections. Entrepreneurial fraudsters could send mailings to all the names on a voter list, see which ones were returned and assemble a list of non-deliverables; they could then recruit people to vote in person under those names without having to show identification (see above).\n\nDemocrats\u2019 claims that there have been no large-scale cases of voter fraud to date are beside the point. Incentives matter, and H.R. 1 creates massive incentives for people to cheat. We would never apply such a standard to community safety or the prevention of a mass-casualty terrorist attack. Our democracy can work only if all people, not just the partisans of one faction, trust that our system is fair. H.R. 1 makes it impossible to reach that standard because it creates so many clear and obvious ways to subvert elections.\n\nIt would be easy to create an election system that satisfies people concerned about voter fraud and voter suppression. Our smartphones now have fingerprint- and face-ID systems that protect our devices from unauthorized use. We could easily create a national voter database and attach pictures or fingerprints to every registration. This would even be compatible with same-day registration, provided each polling place had a computer with a camera that could snap a picture and immediately upload it to the database. Australia\u2019s vote-by-mail system requires each applicant to create and answer a personal security question, thereby ensuring that the person who casts the mail-in vote is the person they claim to be. Millions of Australians use this each election, and there is no history of voter fraud or suppression.\n\nDemocratic elections are America\u2019s birthright. H.R. 1 would sell that birthright for no reason and must be defeated.",

Hasen is the chancellor's professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine and the author of \" Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy March 16, 2021 at 5:33 p.m. GMT+1 Are Democrats in Congress and their good government allies going to blow it again on voting rights? It sure looks like they could \u2014 by portraying the 791-page For the People Act, or H.R. 1, as the only hope to save American democracy from a new wave of Republican voter suppression. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right This mammoth bill has little chance of being enacted. But a more pinpointed law, including one restoring a key part of the Voting Rights Act, could make it out of the Senate to guarantee voting rights protections for all in the 2022 and 2024 elections. In the wake of former president Donald Trump's relentless false attacks on the integrity of the 2020 elections, Republican lawmakers throughout the country have proposed over 250 bills to make it harder for people to register and vote. Although the sponsors tout these bills as measures to deter fraud or promote voter confidence, the history of similar laws shows that they do neither. Laws requiring people to make copies of their driver's license to prove their identities when voting absentee, for example, prevent no appreciable amount of fraud because there is not a lot of impersonation voter fraud overall. Nonetheless, some of these state laws are likely to pass, and some will probably survive court challenges, thanks to a Supreme Court that has proved to be less protective of voting rights over time. This means that many of the gains in voting rights in the fall, prompted partly by the coronavirus pandemic, may be rolled back by the next time Americans choose members of the House, the Senate and the White House. Trump's bogus attacks on mail-in voting hurt his supporters, too But Congress does have broad powers in the Constitution to set election rules and combat these new efforts at voter suppression. To begin with, Article I, Section 4 gives Congress the power to \u201cmake or alter\u201d any state voting rules applicable to presidential elections. Congress also has the power to enforce constitutional amendments that promote voting rights, including the 14th (guaranteeing equal protection), 15th (barring race discrimination in voting), 19th (barring gender discrimination in voting), and 26th (barring age discrimination in voting). That gives it some power over the rules of purely state and local elections as well, as when Congress banned the use of literacy tests in the Voting Rights Act. That means Congress likely has the power to do many, but not all, of the things H.R. 1 proposes. Some parts of it could well be found unconstitutional if it passed, such as a provision requiring states to re-enfranchise all people convicted of felonies who are not currently serving time in a correctional institution. Courts could potentially find that provision interferes with states' constitutional right to set qualifications for voters. But potential unconstitutionality of some provisions is not the main problem with H.R. 1. Instead, the problem is that the bill contains a wish list of progressive proposals that make it unlikely to survive debate in the Senate. In addition to sensible provisions protecting voting rights, the bill also contains controversial rules on campaign financing, including the creation of a public financing program for congressional candidates, new ethics rules for the Supreme Court, and a requirement that most candidates for president and vice president publicly disclose their tax returns. Not only is H.R. 1 unlikely to survive a filibuster led by Republican senators such as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who has directed most of his opposition to the campaign finance aspects of H.R. 1; it is not clear it could even get 50 votes from the Senate's Democrats and their independent allies. That makes it an unlikely vehicle for convincing Democrats to abandon the filibuster requirement for voting rights bills, as I and others have advocated. Why would Democrats such as Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), who say they want to keep the filibuster in place, vote to abolish it for a bill that might not even have majority support? The filibuster is here to stay. But this reform could ease Senate gridlock. A narrower bill targeted at protecting voting rights more directly would appear to have a better chance of passage, by assuring that there are more than 50 senators \u2014 including perhaps some moderate Republicans \u2014 to support the bill. Such a narrower bill still might require blowing up the filibuster for voting rights reform, but that target seems much more achievable with a pinpointed proposal. What would be in the new, narrower bill? There are many parts of H.R. 1 and of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act that are worth copying or modifying, and at least some of these could attract moderate Republican support. First, Congress could restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. In 2013, the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder killed the preclearance provision in Section 5 of the 1965 law that had required states with a history of discrimination in voting to get federal approval for changes in voting rules before they could make them. These states had to demonstrate that the proposed changes, such as cutbacks in days of early voting, would not make minority voters worse off. The court held in Shelby that the formula for determining which states needed to get advance clearance was outdated because it was not tied to current voting discrimination. Congress could reenact preclearance with a new coverage formula tied to current evidence of discrimination. Second, Congress could require that states offer ample registration and voting opportunities to voters. For example, lawmakers could require that states offer online registration opportunities; 40 states already do , and when Texas was ordered to do so recently as part of litigation, half a million more people registered to vote. Congress could also require that states offer two weeks of some form of early voting \u2014 whether in-person, by mail or both \u2014 in all federal elections. It could even require that states offer no-excuse absentee balloting. Third, Congress could require states to assure election security. Lawmakers could require states only to allow voting for federal elections on machines that produce a piece of paper that can be counted in a recount, assuring that the totals announced by voting machines can be verified by hand. Congress could also require states to have certain procedures in place to protect the integrity of voter registration databases and other pieces of critical election infrastructure. These requirements are important for both to assure that election results reflect the people's will as well as to promote public confidence. Voting machines didn't steal the election. But most are still terrible technology. Finally, Congress could end partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts by requiring states to use bipartisan or nonpartisan commissions to draw the lines. Ending the scourge of partisanship in redistricting will not only assure that members of Congress are more representative of the will of the voters; it will also help to create the conditions where candidates appeal to the center and are less driven by partisanship. A more tightly drawn measure along these lines is likely to get more support than the sprawling H.R. 1. It would reverse many of the new suppressive laws that could be enacted by Republican legislatures, but it wouldn't reach further into other issues that could pull apart majority support in the Senate. Some Democrats and progressives, though, are pushing H.R. 1, seeing this as the only opportunity for change in this generation. Soon Democrats might lose control of one or both houses of Congress, which would mean H.R. 1 or other voting reform no longer have a chance of passing. In 2006, I and others testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Congress needed to change the coverage formula of the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act because, without a change, the Supreme Court could strike the measure down as exceeding congressional power. But Congress and good government groups decided to roll the dice, believing the Supreme Court would never strike down a crown jewel of the civil rights movement. The gamble did not pay off, and Shelby County has made things far worse. We are at a similar moment now. H.R. 1 is unlikely to make it out of the Senate. It should be swapped out for a measure more directly targeted at the voter suppression to come that could actually be signed by President Biden and upheld in full by the courts. Holding out for a perfect bill, in the end, will just prevent the enactment of a good one. At the moment, it seems more likely that nothing will become law before the 2022 elections than that H.R. 1 will. And then Democrats will look back at yet another missed opportunity to protect voters.

Sheila Jackson Lee Sheila Jackson LeeHouse panel approves bill to set up commission on reparations Race debate grips Congress Congressional Black Caucus members post selfie celebrating first WH visit in four years MORE (D-Texas), who took up H.R. 40\u2019s cause after the late Rep. John Conyers John James ConyersHouse panel approves bill to set up commission on reparations Chicago suburb could serve as road map for reparations Obama says reparations 'justified' MORE (D-Mich.) retired from Congress in 2017, the bill passed through the House Judiciary Committee along party lines.\n\nThe committee held a hearing on H.R. 40 back in February, which featured multiple reparative justice experts. The idea of reparations, while not new, has gained steam in recent years, and the legislation currently has 176 co-sponsors in the House, its most ever.\n\n\u201cToday, the U.S. Congress finally took the kind of action on reparations that movement advocates, experts and Black people have been demanding for decades,\u201d Dreisen Heath, a racial justice researcher for Human Rights Watch who testified at the hearing, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis milestone moves the nation one step closer to comprehensively reckoning with the disastrous effects of slavery that have been compounding for Black people every day.\u201d\n\nReparations remains a controversial issue politically, and it's not certain the measure will reach the House floor, though there will certainly be pressure on Democrats to do so.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerHouse panel approves bill to set up commission on reparations Race debate grips Congress Watchdog: Capitol Police need 'culture change' MORE (D-Md.) on Wednesday did not commit to bringing the bill to the floor, saying he was waiting to see what the Judiciary Committee would do.

Under the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, the federal government doled out $20,000 direct payments to Japanese Americans who were interned by the federal government during World World II.\n\nSome local and state governments have already taken strides toward beginning the process of reparations; California state lawmakers passed a bill similar to H.R. 40 last year.\n\nExperts on the topic have stressed that direct payments are far from the only form that reparations can take.\n\n\u201cThe vestiges of redlining, segregated schools, deliberately substandard medical care, none of those things can be solved by a check,\u201d ACLU Trone Center for Justice and Equality director Jeffery Robinson told The Hill in a previous interview. \u201cThose things have to be solved by institutional changes.\u201d\n\nTo this point, last month Evanston, Ill., passed the first country\u2019s first reparations program.\n\nInstead of direct payments, the initiative allocates $400,000 to fund a block of $25,000 housing grants. Eligible Black residents who are accepted for the initiative will be able to put the funds toward either mortgage, home improvement or down payment assistance.",

    "body": "By Daniel Marans and Kevin Robillard Content loading... A host of powerful unions are helping the pharmaceutical industry battle a key plank of President Joe Biden 's agenda, a display of how broad the powerful lobby's reach extends into Democratic politics. The unions, mostly in the building trades, are members of a joint advocacy group, the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor-Management Association , that is airing television ads attacking the House Democratic plan to empower the federal government to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. The group, known as PILMA, grew out of the industry's use of union labor to build and maintain its research and manufacturing facilities. Advertisement \u201cIn hard times, America's best answered the call: Skilled union workers and scientists came together to develop vaccines and defeat COVID-19. But bad policy proposals like H.R. 3 and similar provisions being considered in the U.S. Senate will put their jobs in jeopardy,\u201d the TV spot says, referring to the legislation. \u201cIt will cost America thousands of jobs, stifle innovation and discovery of new medicines, and put barriers between patients and their medications.\u201d The ad, which is airing nationally, goes on to ask viewers to contact their member of Congress to oppose H.R. 3. Biden has made it clear that he considers the prescription drug pricing plan to be a major part of his agenda, and congressional Democrats are expected to include it in a $3.5-trillion education, health and social spending package they will negotiate in the coming months. The party sees the plan as both a way to stop rising costs from swamping families, and as a political winner that will help the senior citizens who consistently turn out for midterm elections. \u201cWhat I'm proposing would reduce the total cost by thousands of dollars and seniors would not pay more than $250 a month on average,\u201d Biden said in a speech last month. \u201cThat'd be a game changer.\u201d Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Joe Biden has worked closely with labor unions throughout his career. But several building trades unions are trying to stop a prescription drug bill he supports. Advertisement PILMA is also running ads in California and Oregon thanking Democratic Reps. Scott Peters (Calif.) and Kurt Schrader (Ore.), who signed a letter implicitly objecting to H.R. 3 as it is currently written. Peters and Schrader, who are among the House's top recipients of pharmaceutical industry PAC donations , joined eight Democratic colleagues in expressing their preference for bipartisan drug legislation that enhances the United States' \u201cinnovation ecosystem,\u201d in lieu of H.R. 3. Download In April, PILMA sent similar letters to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Even so, PILMA's ad campaign represents an unusual assault from a faction of organized labor on one of Biden and congressional Democrats' highest priorities. An influential federation of building trades unions told HuffPost that it disagrees with the ads, but the organization remains on PILMA's board, giving the TV spots organized labor's implicit stamp of approval. The core provisions in H.R. 3 would override a 2003 law expanding Medicare to include prescription drugs that barred the federal government from negotiating lower prices for the drugs it pays for. Any effort to water it down not only threatens Democrats' efforts to provide relief for Americans struggling to pay high drug prices, but also jeopardizes the larger budget package's financing mechanism, since lower prescription drug payments are projected to save the federal government more than $450 billion over a 10-year period and generate an additional $45 billion in new revenue. \u201cThis to me is just the latest example, frankly, of how some unions are willing to allow their valuable political capital to be hijacked,\u201d said a longtime strategist for organized labor, who asked for anonymity to protect professional relationships. \u201cWhat these pharma corporations care about is being able to point to worker and labor support in lobbying certain Democratic legislators. That's what this is \u2015 period, end of the story.\u201d The unions on PILMA's board of trustees are the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART); the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW); the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA); the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers (IBB); the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental, and Reinforcing Iron Workers (Iron Workers union); the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE); the International Union of Police Associations (IUPA); and the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). Not all building trades unions are members of PILMA: The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), which tends to be more progressive than the other building trades, is not a supporter of the organization. A spokesman for the union declined to comment. This is one time where you've just got to kind of nudge your friend and say, \u2018Let's look at the long-term thing, what's going to happen here.' Randy Bryce, union iron worker and former congressional candidate North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU), a labor federation that represents more than 3 million workers in 14 unions, is also on PILMA's board. In a statement to HuffPost on Thursday \u2015 after PILMA had aired hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ads \u2015 the group attempted to back away from the ad's message. Subscribe to the Politics email. From Washington to the campaign trail, get the latest politics news. \u201cWe do not support these ads,\u201d said NABTU spokesperson Betsy Barrett. But PILMA's executive director Tim Dickson confirmed to HuffPost that the organization's board, which includes NABTU chief of staff Mike Monroe, arrives at all of its public-facing policy positions , including its opposition to H.R. 3, by unanimous consensus. Advertisement SMART \u2014 whose general president, Joseph Sellers, is also president of PILMA \u2014 reiterated its opposition to H.R. 3. \u201cSMART steadfastly supports and shares the goal of affordable access to prescription drugs for all Americans,\u201d said SMART spokesperson Paul Pimentel. \u201cAt the same time, we are opposed to efforts that would harm opportunities for current and future workers to work in an industry that provides a path to a middle-class career.\u201d Asked to respond to criticism that its opposition stymies Biden's agenda, Pimentel said that SMART's stance reflects its commitment to providing \u201cjobs that will put [workers] on the path to a stable career.\u201d \u201cThe jobs that would be harmed by this legislation as written are among those that would provide these types of opportunities,\u201d Pimentel said. Randy Bryce, a former Wisconsin congressional candidate and longstanding member of the Iron Workers union, called for building trades unions to consider the impact that PILMA's advocacy work might have on its own members, given how drug prices affect the cost of the union's health care plan. \u201cIt's great to have these alliances where they're going to use union help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is one time where you've just got to kind of nudge your friend and say, \u2018Let's look at the long-term thing, what's going to happen here.'\u201d Pimentel, the SMART spokesperson, acknowledged that prescription drug prices contribute to the rising costs of the union's health care plans, but said the union weighs that against the importance of the jobs needed to sustain those plans. \u201cAn even greater threat to these plans would be a lack of jobs and work hours that pay into these plans and make health care affordable to a wider range of members and their families,\u201d he said. Jeenah Moon via Reuters House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) addresses the North America's Building Trades Unions 2019 conference. NABTU President Sean McGarvey, left, clasps her hand. The building trades unions, often comprised of workers with more advanced skills than other unions, are famous for supporting virtually any policy that provides new jobs for their members. That has sometimes put them at loggerheads with other stakeholders in the progressive movement. For example, to the consternation of environmental groups , NABTU and its member unions have consistently worked with the fossil-fuel industry companies that employ them to support continued oil and gas extraction , as well as the construction of pipelines and other infrastructure to transport those resources. A few years ago, building trades unions in Seattle vehemently opposed the city's effort to impose a \u201chead\u201d tax on employees of large corporations in order to expand services for the homeless population. The unions banded with Amazon to warn that the measure would destroy jobs by decreasing corporate development in the city. Some rank-and-file union iron workers even showed up at a rally for affordable housing to heckle Seattle Councilwoman Kshama Sawant , a socialist, in May 2018. But partnering with Big Pharma against Democrats' efforts to reduce prescription drug prices likely represents new terrain, even for the member-focused building trades unions. \u201cThe notion that these unions are going to allow these self-interested employers to use their valuable political capital in service of preventing an incredibly important policy objective that would benefit tens of millions of workers both union and non-union is a reminder of some of the reactionary elements within leadership of the labor movement,\u201d the union strategist told HuffPost. Advertisement PILMA is entirely funded by PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry's trade group, according to Dickson of PILMA. Dickson noted, however, that PILMA does not merely advocate for industry priorities. PILMA has also promoted policies favored by the building trades unions that are not of direct importance to pharmaceutical companies. For example, the group has spoken in opposition to expanding industry control over construction apprenticeship programs, and in support of prevailing wage laws that protect unions' ability to compete on a level playing field. PILMA's spending \u2015 about $300,000, according to a Democratic strategist tracking media buys \u2015 is just a small slice of the industry's efforts to battle prescription drug pricing reform. The industry has spent more than $18 million on ads opposing Medicare price negotiation, according to Politico . It's also funded at least eight different groups running ads against price negotiation, including nonprofits affiliated with House and Senate GOP leadership and groups claiming to represent seniors. The AARP, along with various Democratic super PACs and nonprofits, are running millions of dollars in ads promoting the president's agenda. Two major Democratic polling firms \u2015 Lake Research Partners and Hart Research Associates \u2015 wrote a memo last month about the popularity of the proposal and its importance to the party's agenda. \u201cAs Congress debates ending the ban on Medicare negotiation in the budget reconciliation package, it is clear that Americans, including seniors, think allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices is one of the best ways to address concerns about rising prices,\u201d the pollsters wrote. \u201cThey want Congress to act.\u201d Calling all HuffPost superfans!

Representatives of a hemp advocacy group met with members of Congress including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell last week to rally support for legislation drafted to promote hemp agriculture. The day of meetings with senators and members of the House of Representatives was coordinated by the U.S. Hemp Roundtable to advocate for Food and Drug Administration regulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and to support pending legislation including provisions of the Hemp Advancement Act and the SAFE Banking Act.  The U.S. Hemp Roundtable is a national group advocating for the hemp industry consisting of dozens of companies and organizations committed to safe hemp and CBD products. The group's board of directors and staff traveled to the nation's capital on April 6 to meet personally with several members of Congress to advocate for several pieces of legislation related to hemp agriculture, which was legalized by the 2018 Farm Bill.  The U.S. Hemp Roundtable met with members of Congress last week to lobby support for several ... [+] hemp-related bills including the SAFE Banking Act.  getty  Topping the list of engagements with lawmakers was a meeting between hemp advocates and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who supported including hemp legalization provisions in the Farm Bill. Jonathan Miller, general counsel to the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, says that the meeting with McConnell was scheduled to ensure that the FDA provides a regulatory pathway for hemp products such as CBD.  \u201cWe discussed the continuing challenges faced by the hemp and CBD industries, and the growing frustration with the FDA's lack of movement on its 2018 promise to develop a regulatory pathway for the sale of ingestible CBD products,\u201d Miller writes in an email. \u201cIn addition to trying to secure passage of HR 841, HR 6134 and S 1698 \u2013 three bills that would require that the FDA regulate hemp extracts such as CBD \u2013 we discussed the option of inserting language in a must-pass bill that requires FDA to issue a formal policy of enforcement discretion while it develops its regulatory regime.\u201d  The delegation also visited with Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree to discuss her bill, the Hemp Advancement Act of 2022 H.R. 6645 ), which would improve the 2018 Farm Bill's hemp provisions and provide greater clarity and flexibility to hemp growers and processors. The measure also includes provisions designed to protect consumers from unsafe products.

John Hickenlooper of Colorado and his Republican colleague Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to encourage greater support for S. 1698 , which would regulate CBD as a dietary supplement and food or beverage additive. Another meeting with Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon focused on his efforts to pass H.R. 841 , which would regulate CBD as a dietary supplement, and the push to hold a hearing in the Energy and Commerce committee on hemp and CBD.  Lobbying Effort Included Support For The SAFE Banking Act  The U.S. Hemp Roundtable lobbying effort also included a visit to Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, to discuss efforts to pass the SAFE Banking Act H.R. 1996 ). The legislation would allow banks to provide financial services to regulated cannabis companies in states with legal marijuana. Alyssa Erickson, U.S. Hemp Roundtable public affairs and marketing coordinator, explains that the bill would also benefit hemp businesses.

Photo courtesy of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable  \u201cAlthough the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp, many producers continue to face difficulties finding banks and credit card companies to handle financial transactions, particularly those within the CBD space,\u201d writes Erickson. \u201cThe SAFE Banking Act contains specific provisions secured by Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) to protect commerce in the hemp and CBD industries. The U.S. Hemp Roundtable is proud to have worked closely with Rep. Barr and lead bill sponsor, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) to ensure the SAFE Banking Act benefits all legal U.S. cannabis businesses.\u201d  Additional meetings included a virtual conference with the staffs of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, ranking Republican member of the Senate Health, Education, Pensions and Labor Committee, Democratic House Agriculture Committee vice chair Alma Adams of North Carolina, as well as the offices of members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  U.S. Hemp Roundtable president Pete Meachum said after last week's day of lobbying that \u201cI was very encouraged by the continued, bi-partisan support for hemp farmers and businesses, and look forward to continued policy progress in the months ahead.\u201d  \u201cThe hemp industry's policy agenda is ambitious \u2013 from ensuring that the FDA regulates hemp products such as CBD to providing regulatory relief for our nation's farmers,\u201d Miller said in a statement from the U.S. Hemp Roundtable. \u201cIt is so great to have so many strong friends on both sides of the aisle, including both the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Republican Leader. Now it's time to ensure that our bipartisan support is reflected in urgent policy change.\u201d  A.J. Herrington  Editorial Standards  Print  Reprints & Permissions",

    "body": "The Democratic Party\u2019s appetite for gun-control legislation is constant, especially in the wake of a mass shooting. Occasionally, they are able to enlist sufficient Republican support in the Congress to actually pass legislation limiting the Second Amendment rights of citizens. This was the case last month when the requisite number of Republicans crossed over and gave Democrats a victory in sending the \u201cBipartisan Safer Communities Act\u201d to President Biden for his eager signature.\nNot content with their success in passing that expansive legislation, Democrats in the House last week passed another bill to prove they are \u201cdoing something\u201d to prevent criminals from shooting innocent victims. At least that\u2019s the theory behind the \u201cActive Shooter Alert Act of 2022\u201d (H.R. 6538) that now awaits Senate action.\n H.R. 6538 has a price tag of \u201conly\u201d $2 million (at least to start) and does not itself restrict exercise of citizens\u2019 Second Amendment rights. It is, however, pointless and unnecessary.\n Obviously the bill\u2019s primary sponsors,\u00a0Democratic Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline and Republican Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, concluded that existing \u201calert\u201d communications between law enforcement agencies are inadequate. Thus, we need an office at the U.S. Department of Justice dedicated to monitoring such events and alerting everyone else \u2014 another bureaucracy to \u201ccoordinate\u201d something, along with a \u201cstudy\u201d to be conducted by the Government Accountability Office to let us know how they are doing.\n Don\u2019t get me wrong, the disgracefully inadequate, bordering on criminally negligent behavior by the school police agency during the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, illustrates that there are shortcomings in how some police departments and individual officers respond to an \u201cactive shooter.\u201d (Strangely, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed with much fanfare by Biden, contained no funds specifically earmarked for improved police training, but that\u2019s another story.) However, setting up another office in Washington to serve as nothing but a clearing house for \u201cactive shooter\u201d information is not going to touch, much less solve such serious problems.\n  Still, 43 House GOP members joined all but a single Democrat in voting to create another \u201cAmber Alert,\u201d this one for active shooter situations.\n While such an action may sound benign, the actual language in the bill, had Members actually read it before voting \u201caye,\u201d should have alerted them that this \u201calert\u201d bill is far too broad to be of serious benefit. For example, the term \u201cactive shooter\u201d includes any person \u201cengaged in killing or attempting to kill\u201d (my emphasis) persons in a \u201cpopulated area.\u201d Additionally, the active shooter must be \u201cdetermined to pose an active, imminent threat to people in the populated area.\u201d It is apparent right there that there will be problems figuring out what may be in the mind of a \u201cdetermined\u201d person \u201cattempting to kill\u201d people.\u00a0\n The tendency, of course, will be to include more not fewer potential shooting scenarios in the alert system.\n The more problematic provision in the legislation is its definition of \u201cPopulated Area\u201d as would trigger a nationwide alert \u2014 \u201ca location where one or more persons other than the active shooter are present.\u201d In other words, if there is an armed individual \u201cdetermined\u201d to pose a danger to at least one other person in an area where there are at least two people present, the alert goes into effect. Broad enough?\n \n Then there is the \u201ccoordination\u201d responsibility. The Justice Department must coordinate its work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Transportation Department, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n H.R. 6538 is the epitome of a pointless response to a problem needing hard work and commitment, but which receives only a glossy, bureaucratic veneer from the Congress. In a word, as noted by Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan who voted against the bill \u2014 it is a \u201cgimmick.\u201d\u00a0\n Moreover, this legislation duplicates other communications systems already in place, such as the Integrated Public Alert  Warning System (IPAWS), which itself is in addition to \u201cfusion centers\u201d active in every state and which employ some 3,000 individuals and have cost taxpayers billions of dollars \u201cwith little to show for it,\u201d even though supposed to alert communities to criminal or terrorist activities.\n As illustrated by passage of H.R. 6538, however, duplication of effort is hardly a reason for the House of Representatives not to enact more legislation.\n Bob Barr represented Georgia\u2019s Seventh District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003. He served as the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta from 1986 to 1990 and was an official with the CIA in the 1970s. He now practices law in Atlanta and serves as head of Liberty Guard.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- WASHINGTON, Jan. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- America First Political Committee announced today the formation of a Congressional Candidate Committee to remove Florida Congressman Carlos Gimenez (FL-26 Congressional District) from Congress. Gimenez has become 'Persona Non Grata' in the 26 th Congressional District due to his Socialist voting record.  America First will make a formal endorsement in the near future of a Conservative Republican Candidate to Primary Gimenez in the August 23, 2022 election. Gimenez is NOT supported by America First, Donald Trump or the Republican Party.  Carlos Gimenez has voted with Nancy Pelosi and the radical leftists. Gimenez also defended disgraced Liz Cheney after she voted in favor of the 'Sham Impeachment' against Donald Trump. Gimenez doubled down in defending Cheney after the Republican Caucus censored and removed Liz Cheney from Republican Party Leadership.  Gimenez also voted for the 'January 6' Socialist Democrat witch hunt against American Citizens and Republican voters. Gimenez, like Liz Cheney openly votes and sides with the Socialist Democrats.  Some other notable examples of Gimenez Socialist votes include:  Gimenez openly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. That alone was grounds for expulsion from the GOP;  Gimenez voted with Nancy Pelosi on H.R. 550, to allow the federal government to create a database, track unvaccinated Americans, who could be targeted, segregated, discriminated against, and forced to comply with vaccination mandates;  Gimenez voted with Nancy Pelosi on Anti-Second Amendment legislation HR-8, making it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to purchase, own, carry, and use a firearm;  Gimenez voted with Nancy Pelosi on H.R. 6 for 'Open Borders and Amnesty' to over 20 million criminal illegal aliens, which would permanently avoid deportation, obtain a pathway to citizenship, and full voting rights;  Gimenez also voted with Nancy Pelosi to strip Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of all Congressional Committee positions.

    "body": "The House voted to transform Washington, DC into a state Thursday on the pure party-line vote of 216-208.\n\nBefore the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argued in favor of the bill, describing Washington, DC residents as being \u201cdenied their right to fully participate in their democracy.\u201d\n\nPelosi also said Washington, DC \u201cpays more federal taxes per capita than any other state. Its budget is larger than 12 states. Its population is larger than two states\u2026 Its people have been fighting for voting rights for 220 years, with a full 86 percent recently voting for statehood.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker saluted Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) for her \u201cleadership in bringing this historic legislation to the floor\u201d; Norton then said of the legislation, \u201cCongress has a moral obligation and constitutional authority to pass HR 51.\u201d\n\nThe Republican opposition to D.C. statehood was not so complementarity of Ms.\u00a0Norton\u2019s \u201csocialist utopia.\u201d\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY) spoke opposing the legislation. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear what H.R. 51 is all about,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats adding two new progressive U.S. senators to push a radical agenda championed by the Squad to reshape America into the socialist utopia they dream about.\u201d\n\n\u201cH.R. 51 is not really about voting representation. It\u2019s about Democrats consolidating their power in Washington,\u201d Comer stated.\n\nRep. Jody Hice (R-GA) voiced his opposition to the idea that Washington, DC has no representation, calling it \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does have local representation. [It] also has a delegate right here in the House of Representatives. And has electoral votes for the Presidential election. Seems like \u2013 something no other city in this country has. H.R. 51 flies in the face of what our founders intended,\u201d Hice boldly said.\n\nThe Framers \u201cnever wanted the seat of our government to be a state, and they specifically framed the Constitution to say so,\u201d he concluded.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) took the\u00a0totality of the Democrats\u2019 radical agenda to task. \u201cDemocrats started last week with one of their members saying we should get rid of the police all together. They ended last week with another one of their members being admonished by the trial judge in Minneapolis for saying ridiculous things,\u201d he pointed out.\n\n\u201cAnd what did [Democrats] do in between?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThey passed this bill out of committee which gives two new Democrat senators to the District of Columbia and, less than 24 hours after that bill passed in committee, they introduced legislation to pack the Supreme Court,\u201d Jordan recalled.\n\n\u201cIn three months of Democrats being in control of the federal government\u2026 They created a crisis on the southern border. And they continue their push to defund the police now so they can continue their radical policies,\u201d he reminded the House floor.\n\n\u201cThink about what else they passed out of this body,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) argued that, \u201cNo state has been admitted by the Constitution, but no state was created from a territory which was crafted in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe legislation will now proceed to the Senate, where Sens. Mark Kelly (D-AZ),\u00a0Joe Manchin (D-WV), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Angus King (I-ME) have said they are a doubtful \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nThe Biden administration, however,\u00a0declared\u00a0its support of D.C. statehood Tuesday,\u00a0contrasting previous Democrat administrations\u2019 legal determinations of unconstitutionality.\n\nThe\u00a0White House Office of Management and Budget issued a Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 51, writing, \u201cEstablishing the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth as the 51st state will make our Union stronger and more just.\u201d\n\nBut legal scholars and two Democrat administrations have objected to D.C. statehood\u2019s viability without a Constitutional amendment to the Twenty-Third Amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Office of Legal Counsel in 2007\u00a0believed\u00a0it was unconstitutional,\u00a0the Justice Department under former President Reagan and former President Carter\u00a0stated\u00a0the transformation was unconstitutional, and so did Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, when he sat on the\u00a0D.C.

For AWO and the domestic maritime industry as a whole, H.R. 6395 is one of the most significant laws to be enacted by Congress in many years.The bill includes a landmark provision that affirms the application of U.S. laws, including the Jones Act (the law requiring that vessels transporting cargo between two U.S. ports be American-built, -owned and -crewed), to renewable energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf. The legislation eliminates the uncertainty that had been created by conflicting federal agency interpretations and paves the way for significant new investment in American vessels, and jobs for American mariners, to serve the burgeoning offshore renewable energy market.H.R. 6395 also brings much-needed reform to the administrative process for issuance of Jones Act waivers by clarifying that a national defense waiver must be tied to a legitimate national defense need, establishing strict time limits on non-defense waivers, and increasing transparency by requiring public reporting on any foreign vessel using such a waiver to operate in U.S. domestic commerce. Other key provisions for the tugboat, towboat and barge industry include the establishment of the Maritime Transportation System Emergency Relief Program, codification of requirements for harbor tugs engaged in limited operations beyond the Boundary Line and a time-limited directive to the Coast Guard to establish differentiated inspection user fees for towing vessels using the Towing Safety Management System and Coast Guard options to comply with Subchapter M towing vessel safety regulations.\"We extend our hearty thanks to the many AWO members, industry coalition partners, and bipartisan champions in Congress who helped to get this important legislation over the finish line despite numerous challenges,\" AWO President & CEO Jennifer Carpenter stated. \"We look forward to working with our partners and allies to build on this progress and deliver results that make a positive difference for the domestic maritime industry as the 117 Congress gets underway.\"",

    "body": "There is new urgency for many of those provisions, given the Republicans\u2019 unprecedented effort since the 2020 election to roll back voting access on the misguided theory that less democracy is good for their party (a reaffirmation of the party\u2019s aversion to democracy and dependence on minority rule). The Brennan Center, which has been tracking these efforts, reports: \u201cThus far this year, 28 states have introduced, prefiled, or carried over 106 bills to restrict voting access. These proposals primarily seek to: (1) limit mail voting access; (2) impose stricter voter ID requirements; (3) limit successful pro-voter registration policies; and (4) enable more aggressive voter roll purges.\u201d For example, Republican lawmakers in Arizona are trying to remove voters from its early-voting list, which would prevent them from automatically receiving a mail ballot.\n\nNeedless to say, the sweeping reform of H.R. 1 currently has no Republican support. So what happens to voting reform, perhaps the most significant issue for the new president and Congress after the pandemic and recession? Keep an eye on five separate factors that will affect the course of any reform effort.\n\nFirst, at the state level, ordinary voters who found early voting or voting by mail convenient may be annoyed to learn that lawmakers want to make it harder for them to vote. Voting rights advocates, state legislators and governors around the country are going to battle over such measures. With the closely divided Congress likely tied up with the pandemic and the economy, a good deal of the action will be at the state and even county levels. The result will determine just how much additional damage the Republican Party can do to our electoral system.\n\nSecond, watch out for attorney Marc Elias, who racked up more than 60 wins in court against spurious Republican voting fraud claims in 2020. He is gearing up to do battle to challenge new restrictions. He also is moving forward with his own plans for improving election administration, such as reforming the certification process, which Republicans tried to manipulate to overturn the election; easing access to voting (as Elias put it, \u201cthe test for voting laws, rules, and practices should be whether they improve voting access and participation\u201d); maximizing ballot acceptance (e.g., making it more difficult to invalidate ballots for ticky-tacky technical errors); auditing election administration; and publishing all election rule changes online.\n\nThird, are there any elements of H.R. 1 that a bipartisan group might embrace, akin to the covid-19 aid bill that lawmakers pushed through in December? Reform of the U.S. Postal Service, additional funding for election administration and requirements for a paper ballot trail and periodic audits are among the less controversial provisions. If Democrats can be persuaded to diverge from a one-standard-fits-all model, perhaps they can reach agreement on minimum standards for all states to employ some form of early or non-excuse voting as well as online or automatic voter registration.\n\nFourth, H.R. 1 would not restore the pre-clearance provision of the Voting Rights Act (which used to be amended by near-unanimous votes, but was invalidated by the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder). But another bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would do so. That may be a blessing in disguise. Presented as a stand-alone bill, the John Lewis bill would restore the Justice Department\u2019s ability to head off measures that erect hurdles to voting before they are implemented. Consideration of the bill would in essence become a referendum on voter suppression. Republicans might still thwart the bill using the filibuster, but that brings us to the next issue to watch.\n\nIf the Republican Party persistently refuses to hold an up-or-down vote even on the John Lewis bill (aside the larger H.R. 1 for a moment), Democrats will face immense pressure to modify if not do away entirely with the filibuster either before the 2022 midterms or after (especially if Democrats pick up a couple of Senate seats). That may be the ultimate showdown on just how much ground Democrats are willing to concede to a Republican Party that rejects the sanctity of elections, the concept of majority rule and even the notion of a multiracial democracy not dominated by its White base. The debate will be critical to the future of our democracy.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 26: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about the coronavirus pandemic in the ... [+] State Dining Room of the White House on January 26, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)\n \n   \n  Getty Images \n  \n \nAh, the vexing problem of prescription drug prices. As a share of healthcare expenditures, prescription drugs account for about a dime for every dollar spent. And it\u2019s been that way for a very long time. Yet, for patients, because coverage of prescription drugs is much less comprehensive than hospital and physician services they feel the pain of ever-rising out-of-pocket costs. \n \nLaunch prices of a number of high-profile treatments, for example, gene and cell therapies, have breached the $1 million mark. And, for branded drugs that are already on the market their list prices continue an unrelenting ascent while the growth in net prices of existing drugs remains stagnant. The gross-to-net bubble is alive and well. \n \nSo, what will the Biden Administration do? Less than you might think, at least initially. The Biden Administration is freezing a number of Trump era drug price reforms, initiated by the executive branch through executive orders and regulatory changes issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), pending further review. This includes a controversial drug rebate rule, and a requirement that Federally Qualified Health Centers pass along to patients the discounts they receive through the 340B program for insulin and epinephrine products. \n \n \nOn prescription drug prices, the Trump Administration certainly raised many issues in the 2018 HHS Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs. But in the end there wasn\u2019t a lot to show for it with respect to actually moving the needle on list prices, rebates, and patient cost-sharing.\n \n \nMaybe this was an intended consequence of the way our system of government is supposed to work. An executive order sidesteps the legislative process to attempt to accomplish certain policy objectives. However, executive orders may not go against what is considered \u201cCongressional intent.\u201d As such, they\u2019re often deemed unlawful by federal courts.\n \n \nFor example, the Trump Administration\u2019s last-gasp effort - a most favored nation model - to lower the prices of Medicare Part B drugs by pegging reimbursement to the lowest price drug manufacturers receive among a large group of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations, has been scuttled by a temporary court injunction.\n \nEvidently, governing by fiat isn\u2019t an optimal way to attain lower list prices for drugs. It also runs the risk of bumping up against a new Administration\u2019s agenda. A case in point, on November 30th, 2020, the Department of HHS published a final rule that removes safe harbor protection for prescription drug rebates. This had the potential to be significantly impactful, particularly for Medicare Part D and supplemental rebates for Medicaid managed care. It would upend the current system and force 100% pass-through of rebates to Medicare beneficiaries at the point of sale. And, it was to go into effect in January 2022. But, now it is on pause, as the Biden Administration delays it until 2023 and perhaps indefinitely. The reasons for this are manifold. Perhaps the number one consideration is the fear that removal of rebates would raise premiums. Many experts have suggested that premiums would rise for a majority of Part D beneficiaries, if the rebate rule were to be implemented.\n \nBut unlike the Part D drug rebate and Part B drug executive orders, the Biden Administration may countenance Trump Administration efforts to increase drug price transparency. For the pharmaceutical market, the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cTransparency in Coverage\u201d final rule, released in December, requires that health insurers disclose current list prices and historical net prices for prescription drugs and provide patients with personalized estimates of cost sharing, such as co-payments and co-insurance. \n \nThough increased transparency is not a direct pathway towards lower list prices, it could help. However, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers strongly oppose the rule, which they will likely challenge in court.\n \nMoving forward, what gets done by executive order or Congress will depend on how the Biden Administration sizes up the legislative branch\u2019s willingness to act in certain areas in which it has indicated a preferred path for prescription drug prices. \n \nFor instance, the Biden Administration may wish to amend existing law that currently bans Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug manufacturers. Whether this could happen under an executive order, however, remains to be seen. Furthermore, it\u2019s not at all clear that this would necessarily benefit patients. Part D plans have done a reasonably good job at keeping a lid on net costs. It\u2019s the increase in list prices that has driven Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs higher; especially in the deductible phase, and in the coverage phase as a consequence of co-insurance being calculated on the basis of list prices.\n \nAlso, for Medicare Part D, during the campaign the Biden team suggested it would seek to set a ceiling for launch prices of all branded, biologic, and \u201cabusively priced generic drugs\u201d by referencing the average price of these drugs in other developed countries. At the same time, the Biden team proposed limiting Medicare Part D and public option drug prices through a tax penalty on drugmakers for hikes above the general inflation rate.\n \nSeveral of these price containment measures are included in two recently drafted pieces of legislation - H.R.3 (Lower Drug Costs Now Act) and S.2543 (Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act) - which the Biden Administration may want to hitch a wagon to.\n \nThe Biden Administration will in all probability continue down the long and winding road taken by successive Administrations to modify the Medicare Part D benefit design, and could do so in collaboration with Congress. To illustrate, the House bill, H.R.3, introduced by Speaker Pelosi (D-CA), and the Senate bill, S.2543, sponsored by Senators Grassley (R-IA) and Wyden (D-OR), would establish much lower out-of-pocket spending caps for Medicare beneficiaries than presently exist. Equally important, both bills would drastically reallocate liability for catastrophic costs, from government to insurers; Part D and Medicare Advantage plans. These plans would then have to do a better job of containing costs in the pre-catastrophic phases, which could mean a more pro-active approach to negotiating prices with drug makers. Furthermore, the bills would require drug companies to pay a 20% to 30% rebate above the catastrophic threshold. \n \nBoth bills also aim to keep the annual growth of Medicare Parts B and D drug prices under the increase in the consumer price index. And, H.R 3 contains provisions for price controls that may partly align with the Biden Administration\u2019s objectives concerning establishment of ceilings for launch prices of branded, biologic, and \u201cabusively priced generic drugs.\u201d H.R.3 isn\u2019t just targeting launch prices of new products, and this could be a sticking point. Yet, both H.R.3 and the Biden Administration look to reference the average price of drugs in a select group of other countries with very similar Gross Domestic Products per capita, instead of the most favored nation approach - or lowest price among a large group of OECD nations - promulgated by the Trump Administration.\n \nFor those looking for inflammatory rhetoric on drug prices - like Trump\u2019s \u201cthe drug industry is getting away with murder\u201d - or executive orders calling for direct price controls, such actions are unlikely to come from the current Administration. Rather, it\u2019s expected that a more methodical approach will be adopted, building on Congressional initiatives.",

    "body": "Senate Democrats are cramming a federal takeover of elections through a key vote on the Corrupt Politicians Act this week, part of their plan with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to transform America into a permanent one-party socialist nation.\n\nTuesday the Senate Rules Committee is expected to vote along party lines to send S. 1 \u2013 the Senate version of H.R. 1, which is officially named the For the People Act but which is better named the Corrupt Politicians Act \u2013 to the Senate floor. Normally a 9-9 tie vote in committee would doom a bill, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has muscled through a perversion of Senate rules to take to the Senate floor legislation and nominations that should have died in committee.\n\nNormally a Senate committee vote sounds so boring that you only hear about it if you stumble onto a news station on your way to finding the baseball game on TV. But this time your children\u2019s freedom is at stake, as Senate Democrats move one step closer to eradicating the freedoms that make America the greatest nation on earth.\n\nS. 1 is an 880-page federal takeover of all elections nationwide, abolishing voter ID and other commonsense election integrity safeguards, and mandating weeks-long mail-in balloting and other measures that could hijack elections in every state for every election going forward. It would ensure that Republicans can never win another nationwide election for president or for congressional control.\n\nAs S. 1 goes to the floor, Republicans will filibuster it, where it normally would take 60 votes to pass. But Schumer is determined to use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to blow up over a century of Senate rules to abolish the filibuster and force S. 1 through on a 50-50 party-line vote. The Constitution says that the vice president breaks all Senate tie votes, and Vice President Kamala Harris is champing at the bit to seize permanent power in America by making the vote 51-50.\n\nAll that stands in their way are two Democrat senators who say they will not nuke the filibuster: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ). If either one keeps their word, S. 1 will not pass.\n\nBiden relentlessly pushes the Senate to pass S. 1, even bringing Manchin to the White House before the committee vote, no doubt trying to talk the West Virginian into breaking his promise to his home state. Gone is the Biden of past decades, replaced by an old, tired, radicalized version of Biden who robotically supports the extremist socialist agenda put on his desk for signature by Harris, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, Schumer, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\nIt\u2019s key for all Americans to understand how the S. 1 (H.R. 1) Corrupt Politicians Act fits into this power grab to fundamentally transform America into a socialist nation under permanent one-party rule.\n\nOur Constitution\u2019s key to freedom is that it takes government power and breaks it. It breaks power between the federal government and the states. It also breaks federal power between the president, Congress, and the Supreme Court, and sets them against each other. If the power players are busy arm-wrestling with each other, it leaves you free to live your life. That formula has worked for us for more than 200 years.\n\nThat common tie in the various pieces of big legislation the Democrats are trying to ram through is that it would undo this formula for liberty, not just S. 1. They\u2019re trying to pass H.R. 51 to make D.C. a state to give them two more Democrat senators and an instant 52-50 majority to ram through their radical socialist agenda. They\u2019re trying to pass mass amnesty to turn 11 million illegal aliens into voting citizens who would vote for a permanent expansion of the welfare state, paid for by hardworking Americans. They\u2019re trying to pack the Supreme Court by expanding it from nine justices to 13 so that they have a guaranteed liberal majority to rubber-stamp all their unconstitutional socialism.\n\nAny one of these four bills would give the far-left wing of the Democrat Party \u2013 Alexandra Ocasio Cortez (AOC), Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Cori Bush, Mondaire Jones, and others \u2013 permanent control of the House, Senate, the White House \u2013 and even the Supreme Court.\n\nSchumer is doing his part to push through that agenda in the arena of voting. Once he gets S. 1 through the Senate Rules Committee, he will execute a full-court press on Manchin and Sinema to cave on their commitment to their home states and the nation to protect the role the filibuster plays in making the Senate a place where senior statesmen need to build consensus to pass transformational legislation.\n\nOn the election integrity front, Republican governors and legislators nationwide continue passing laws to restore decades of election safeguards that have been abandoned in recent years, laws that make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat.\n\nWith the Corrupt Politicians Act, Biden, Harris, Pelosi, and Schumer are pushing a key component to seize perpetual power, and fundamentally transform America.\n\nKen Blackwell is the former Ohio Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and is on the policy board of the American Constitutional Rights Union (ACRU).",

Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 is a win for the entire veteran community. The VA provides preeminent health care for our members who have spinal cord injuries or diseases, such as MS and ALS. Our members rely on the VA system of care, but when they don't feel safe, can't get basic exams, or are unable to gain access to health care facilities, they are forced to rely on substandard community care, or worse, they opt not to get care at all.This bill improves the quality of health care and benefits our members and their survivors receive. It also helps them to live a life of freedom and independence and reduces hardships on their families and caregivers. We are grateful that Congress and the President worked together to recognize the unique needs of our nation's veterans and stand at the ready to ensure that each provision is implemented effectively.\"Background on H.R. 7105Our nation's veterans deserve and expect quality health care and benefits from the government, whether it's pandemic assistance and proper burials to retraining assistance and housing. This legislation is designed to help the government better deliver critical services, like those noted above, to the veteran community. Other key provisions included in this bill are: eliminating the 12-year delimiting date for disabled veterans to receive counseling, training, and benefits under the Veteran Readiness and Employment program for eligible disabled veterans who separate from military service after January 1, 2013; requiring the VA to provide disability benefits questionnaires online; and lowering the age a surviving spouse may remarry and still receive dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.",

I believe this is what the Framers intended the judiciary to be.\n\nWhether the current Senate ends the filibuster entirely or carves out yet another exception for matters of civil rights and voting rights, it is incumbent to all freedom-loving Americans that House bill H.R. 1, now before the Senate, passes. Without the voting rights requirements in H.R. 1, undemocratic Republican lawmakers around the country will disenfranchise so many Democrat-leaning voters that senators such as Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) will find it impossible to get reelected.",

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) was pushing the Biden Administration to go further with executive action, saying, \u201cMy view is the bigger and bolder the better on gun violence prevention because we have a unique window of opportunity.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Biden team signaled they are more inclined to wait for legislation to reach his desk on other gun control matters.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) put forward H.R. 125 and H.R. 127 in January 2021. Those two bills alone would create a seven-day waiting period for semiautomatic firearm purchases, create a firearm registry, require gun owners to be licensed, mandate that gun owners pay the federal government $800 for liability insurance (to own a gun), and undergo psychological evaluations, among other things.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) will soon be putting forth the universal background check legislation on which Biden campaigned.\n\nRep.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has served as one of the most vocal Democrat critics of \u201cdark money\u2019s\u201d influence in politics, but the Rhode Island Democrat appears to be a significant beneficiary of dark money.\n\nThe national conversation over the allegedly nefarious influences of dark money also extends to many leftist groups \u2014 such as the Sixteen Thirty Fund,\u00a0Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the LCV, Sierra Club, Majority Foward, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund \u2014 which have supported H.R. 1, the For the People Act. Other organizations have supported campaign finance and election transparency reform.\n\nH.R. 1 appears to remove a provision that restrained the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from targeting tax-exempt organizations, which was enacted after the tax agency targeted many conservative organizations\u2019 tax-exempt statuses in 2013. Generally speaking, tax-exempt political organizations do not want to disclose their donors to avoid harassment from political activists; however, given that these organizations have announced their support of the For the People Act, Breitbart News contacted them to see if they would support disclosing their donors and disclose all of their donors over $1,000 in the name of transparency. Breitbart News also contacted New Venture Fund and Demand Justice.\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund is a leftist nonprofit in Washington, DC, that spent $141 million on more than \u201c100 left-leaning causes\u201d during the 2018 midterm elections. The Fund\u2019s efforts included fighting Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, blocking confirmation of Donald Trump nominees, and boosting reforms on voting laws and districting in several states.\n\nThe Arabella Advisors, a D.C.-based consulting firm that caters to left-leaning clients, administers the Sixteen Thirty Fund and the New Venture Fund.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund\u2019s activism was funded by massive \u201canonymous donations, including one gift totaling $51.7 million.\u201d A second high-rolling donor gave the organization $26.7 million, and a third gave them $10 million.\n\nDespite revealing the three highest donation\u00a0amounts, Sixteen Thirty Fund has not revealed who gave them those amounts or their other top donors\u2019 identities.\n\n\u201cThat single donation was more than the group had ever raised before in an entire year before President Donald Trump was elected. Most of the group\u2019s funders are likely to remain a mystery because federal law does not require \u2018social welfare\u2019-focused nonprofits to reveal their donors,\u201d\u00a0Politico wrote in 2019.\n\nPolitico speculated on the Fund\u2019s close ties to the Arabella Advisors, a firm that advises donors and nonprofits and was founded by Clinton administration staffer Eric Kessler.\n\nFailed presidential candidate and billionaire leftist donor Michael Bloomberg gave $250,000 to a super PAC affiliated with the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nThe Democracy Alliance, which is affiliated with billionaire George Sorors, recommended that donors invest millions into the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nAmy Kurtz, the fund\u2019s executive director, when asked by RealClearPolitics if she supports the enactment of donor disclosure as proscribed by the For the People Act and other similar bills, said,\u00a0\u201cWe have lobbied in favor of reform to the current campaign finance system. But we remain equally committed to following the current laws to level the playing field for progressives.\u201d\n\nDespite Kurtz\u2019s equivocation about if her organization would support donor disclosure provisions in H.R. 1, the Sixteen Thirty Fund told the Hawaii state government it would not disclose their donors if they are guaranteed confidentiality.\n\nThe fund wrote to the state government:\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019s comment request on if they would disclose their donors.\n\nThe New Venture Fund is a leftist nonprofit that makes grants and incubates other left-of-center organizations. It operates alongside its 501(c)(4) sister organization, the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nThe organization did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund is a member of the Declaration for American Democracy coalition, which advocates for H.R. 1 and other election transparency reforms.\n\nThe election reform coalition believes that the For the People Act would \u201cput ordinary Americans ahead of Big Money donors.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment about if they would disclose their donors in the interest of transparency.\n\nThe Center for American Progress labels itself as an \u201cindependent nonpartisan policy institute\u201d that aims to enact \u201cbold, progressive ideas.\u201d\n\nCAP has frequently written about the allegedly negative influences of dark money, although they have focused primarily on conservative and Republican organizations such as the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nCAP has written op-eds about how \u201cdark money\u201d is poisoning\u201dAmerican democracy.\u201d\n\nThis raises the question of whether CAP is a dark money organization given that they have not fully disclosed their donors.\n\nIn February, a CAP official told\u00a0Politico\u00a0that the group is not a dark money organization and that they allegedly disclose their donors on its website.\n\nHowever, despite the CAP official\u2019s claim, CAP Action Fund neglected to disclose some of their most significant donors in 2019, including:\n\nIn response to Breitbart News\u2019s comment request, a CAP official pointed to their list of 501(c)(3) donors, which discloses some but not all of their donors.\n\nCAP\u2019s most generous donors, or those that donated over $1 million in 2019, include:\n\nMany of their most significant donors, however, remain anonymous. This includes:\n\nThe CAP official did not respond to a subsequent request for comment as to why they keep these 501(c)(3) donations anonymous.\n\nThe LCV is an environmentalist group that also promotes an environmentalist agenda.\n\nThe LCV almost exclusively endorses Democrats over Republicans. The LCV has endorsed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for president.\n\nThe LCV sent a letter to the House in January urging the lower chamber to pass the Democrats\u2019 marquee legislation.\n\nIn the letter, the environmentalist group called for greater transparency, writing that H.R. 1 would \u201cstrengthen voting rights, increase transparency and fairness in our campaign finance system.\u201d The group also noted that the For the People Act would ensure that the \u201cpeople\u2019s voice, rather than outsized corporate influence, guide our elected officials.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the LCV\u2019s\u00a0support of H.R.1, LCV has not responded as to whether they would disclose their donors.\n\nThe Sierra Club is another environmentalist activist organization that supports H.R. 1.\n\nSierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released a statement after Democrats unveiled the legislation in January in support of donor disclosure and attacking dark money. Brune said:\n\nThe Sierra Club also noted in their press release that it would curb the \u201cundue influence of corporate polluters.\u201d\n\nThe Sierra Club did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment on whether they would support disclosing their donors.\n\nMajority Foward is a leftist activist organization that supports \u201cvoter registration and voter turnout efforts. Our primary mission is to encourage full participation by voters in our election process.\u201d\n\nThe organization is also affiliated with Senate Majority PAC, which is run by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nMajority Forward ran an ad criticizing Republicans for blocking legislation that passed through the House, which includes H.R. 1.\n\nMajority Forward did not respond to a comment request from Breitbart News on disclosing their donors after they have supported H.R. 1.\n\nDemand Justice is a leftist organization seeking a leftward balance in the courts. The organization has held Democrat primary presidential forums in which Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) called for passing H.R. 1.\n\nDemand Justice is a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund and serves as part of a leftist coalition to support packing the Supreme Court with additional justices.\n\nDemand Justice did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment on whether they would support disclosing their donors.\n\nThe EDF is another environmentalist action organization that supports election transparency. The organization announced its support for H.R. 1 in January, claiming the legislation would curb the energy industry\u2019s alleged outsized influence in D.C.\n\nEDF Action senior vice president of political affairs said in a statement in January:\n\nClimate progress depends on a working democracy. That\u2019s why EDF Action is supporting reforms that will strengthen the power of the people. For far too long, money has played an outsized role in Washington, giving too much power to those who profit from polluting sources of energy and oppose bold action on climate change. We need to take this first step of comprehensive democracy reforms so we can ensure that the environmental concerns in every community are not only heard but legislative action is taken to solve these critical problems facing our country. With the reforms included in the For the People Act, we can make voting more accessible so that every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot without interference, actively participate in our democracy and advocate for commonsense legislation that helps to clean up our air and water while fighting for a healthier planet.\n\nEDF Action did not respond to a request for comment from Breitbart News about disclosing their donors given that they support H.R. 1.\n\nThe Americans for Public Trust (APT), a nonprofit dedicated to revealing unethical behavior, released an ad in February noting that many prominent Joe Biden administration members came from leftist dark money organizations.\n\nOne-hundred and forty-five million dollars in dark money went to supporting Biden\u2019s presidential bid, and $345 million went towards aiding Democrats during the 2020 election. In contrast, Republicans only received $145 million in 2020.\n\nCaitlin Sutherland, the Americans for Public Trust\u2019s executive director, told Breitbart News in a comment Friday that these leftist groups have displayed hypocrisy by refusing to disclose their donors while backing donor disclosure.\n\n\u201cThis is just another example of rules for thee, not for me coming from dark money groups and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. Even the administration\u00a0refuses\u00a0to answer if the new pro-Biden dark money group should disclose its donors,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cAnd this all comes after President Biden started paying back the dark money groups that got him elected in the first place.\u00a0Do they truly want to disclose their donors while the payout continues? I guess we will find out.\u201d\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter\u00a0@SeanMoran3.",

Bush/America's VetDogs\n  Smithtown, New York, Feb. 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- America's VetDogs announced that Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10) , introduced bipartisan legislation, H.R. 807: The Working Dog Commemorative Coin Act on Thursday, February 2, 2023. Rep. McHenry was joined by 73 other members as co-sponsors in reintroducing the legislation to the 118 th Congress.\n  \u201cFrom the battlefield to the home front, working dogs provide an invaluable service,\u201d said Congressman McHenry. \u201cNot only do these incredible animals serve alongside our troops and law enforcement, but they also assist wounded veterans when they return home. I'm proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation to honor and support working dogs' contributions.\u201d\n  With a goal to have the bill passed in 2023 and in production in 2025, this bipartisan legislation will instruct the Department of Treasury to mint a three-coin commemorative series to honor the critical role working dogs play in our society. All sales of coins will include a surcharge, which will be paid to America's VetDogs for general expenses associated with the fulfillment of its mission. It costs more than $50,000 to breed, raise, train, and place one service dog; however, there is never a charge to the disabled veteran, servicemember, or first responder.\n  \u201c We are honored to have been selected for this unique opportunity and appreciate the support from Congressman Patrick McHenry and 73 other bipartisan members who have co-sponsored H.R. 807: The Working Dog Commemorative Coin Act ,\u201d said John Miller, president & CEO, America's VetDogs , \u201c Not only will this bipartisan bill and commemorative coin represent the life-changing work service and military working dogs provide, it will also support America's VetDogs to continue our impactful mission of providing these highly trained service dogs to veterans and first responders with disabilities, at no charge to the individual .\u201d",

    "body": "It's easy to assume that President Joe Biden and his Democratic Party allies are fooling themselves, fooling the rest of us or maybe both when they say they will pass legislation to reduce prescription drug prices this year. Congress has never passed this kind of legislation before. Republicans probably won't support it, while Democrats basically have no votes to spare. And the legislation's top opponent, the pharmaceutical industry, is literally the most powerful lobbying group in Washington. But the drug industry just lost a highly visible battle over protecting vaccine patent rights . That feels like a sign that the political environment for prescription drug legislation is more favorable than it has been in a long time. Success is by no means certain, but failure isn't either. Here are a few reasons why. Democratic Ideas Are Extremely Popular The main goal of Democratic proposals is to give the federal government new power over what pharmaceutical companies charge. The idea turns out to be quite popular. Roughly three in four Americans support allowing the government to negotiate prices directly with manufacturers, according to a poll that West Health and Gallup released Thursday morning. And the result was no outlier. It was strikingly similar to poll findings over the past year from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation as well as from Hart Research and North Star Research And prescription drugs aren't just some ancillary concern for voters. Nearly half think drug legislation should be a top priority for Congress, according to a Morning Consult/Politico survey that also came out this week. The public's agitation for action is no great mystery. One in four Americans say they have trouble paying for their drugs, and nearly one in three say they have skipped recommended medications because of the expense, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's polling Some of this has to do with the design of health insurance and the high out-of-pocket costs many Americans face. But some has to do with the fact that prices for name-brand drugs in the U.S. are a lot higher than in any other country, where governments already have some kind of authority to negotiate or set drug prices. Like all polling, the surveys on prescription drugs can't tell us how people will feel once an actual legislative debate plays out. Conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity are already buying ads that warn Democratic legislation will stifle innovation and ration care. But Democrats have answers for these charges and they appear to be effective. Recent polling from Hart Research , on behalf of the progressive group Protect Our Care, found that \u201cevery message in favor of action to lower drug prices is far more convincing than an opposing message, and support remains sky-high after voters hear from both sides.\u201d Work That Went Into 2019 Legislation Can Pay Off Now Congress as a whole has never approved legislation giving the federal government direct power over prescription drug prices, except in some narrowly targeted programs. But the House has. It happened two years ago, when Democrats passed H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act H.R. 3 has several provisions that would reduce drug prices significantly. One would introduce a form of \u201c international reference pricing ,\u201d effectively setting prices of the most expensive drugs here based on what the governments of a half-dozen other countries have negotiated Notably, the prices would apply to what private insurance pays , not just Medicare or Medicaid. H.R. 3 went nowhere after House passage because Republicans in charge of the Senate refused to take it up. Now Democrats have a (bare) majority and have committed to producing legislation. That doesn't mean the Senate can pass something as ambitious as H.R. 3. Even the House might struggle to produce the same legislation again because the Democratic majority is smaller than it was in 2019. But the work that went into H.R. 3 will help regardless. Legislation of any kind requires translating concepts into legislative language, building alliances with interest groups and getting official projections from the Congressional Budget Office. It also requires negotiations among legislative factions \u2015 which, in the case of H.R. 3, led to some very public disputes between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and members like Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a leader of the party's progressive wing. However unpleasant those conversations may have been, they produced a rough consensus on what each wing of the party can support. That will make it easier to get legislation through the House again and it should help in the Senate as well, where the distribution of votes may be different but the position of each faction is roughly the same. Democrats also know a lot more about legislation than they did two years ago. They have a good sense of how key stakeholder groups will react to different policy ideas, for example, and how the Congressional Budget Office will evaluate them. Most important of all, perhaps, leaders have sent a message to their members and to outside groups that they are willing to stand behind a strong bill, despite opposition from the drug industry. That will make it easier to rally support and round up votes. \u201cIt's got very powerful members \u2015 the speaker, the committee chairs \u2015 all going on the record saying we support this, we are for this,\u201d said Frederick Isasi , who started working on health care in the early 2000s and is now executive director of the liberal group Families USA. \u201cThat's a powerful signal going forward.\u201d Donald Trump Could Help (Really) Chris Jennings , president of Jennings Policy Strategies and former official in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, pointed out another reason to think reform has momentum this year: Employer groups are getting more frustrated with the way high prescription costs drive up the cost of employee benefits. \u201cYou are now seeing the business community engage like it never has,\u201d Jennings said. Weird as it sounds, President Donald Trump could also turn out to be an ally \u2015 not because of anything he's doing now, but because of what he did while he was in office. Shortly before leaving office, his administration finalized what it called a \u201c Most Favored Nation \u201d program that tied the price of some Medicare drugs to prices overseas. In other words, it put in place a form of international reference pricing that is also a key provision of H.R. 3. The Most Favored Nation initiative may never take effect because of lawsuits challenging the federal government's ability to launch such a program exclusively through executive power. (Federal courts have already issued orders blocking it temporarily.) But Democrats can use Trump's endorsement of the idea to argue that their approach to drug pricing isn't some crazy left-wing scheme. Democrats can also point out, truthfully, that the official in charge of developing the Most Favored Nation model was Trump Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar , a former executive with the drug manufacturer Eli Lilly. At the time, Azar promoted international reference pricing because, he said, it \u201cwill put American patients first\u201d while the status quo \u201cputs American patients last.\u201d That's not just a defense of what Democrats want to do. It's a distinctly Trumpy defense \u2015 and that could come in handy. Trump's legacy might help in another, more fundamental way. As disengaged as he was from policy, he talked constantly about prescription drugs \u2015 partly because he seemed genuinely irked that other nations were getting a better deal on prices, but partly because he sensed it was good politics. \u201cThere is a reason that Donald Trump kept highlighting outrageous drug costs and the need for Americans to pay far less,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cOne would think that the Republicans who worship at the altar of Trump would get that they do not wish to be on the wrong side of this issue.\u201d Democrats Need Savings From Drug Price Reform Nobody thinks such arguments will prod large numbers of Republicans into supporting the kind of legislation Democrats want to pass. But Trump's record on these issues could reassure more Democrats from more conservative districts and states who feel like they need the political cover to vote yes. And that's not the only motivation they'll have. adding vision, hearing and dental benefits to Medicare, as well as covering uninsured Americans in states where GOP officials have blocked expansion of Medicaid. All of these would cost money. Prescription drug legislation, on the other hand, would save money, because Medicare and Medicaid wouldn't have to spend so much on prescription drugs for their beneficiaries. A Congressional Budget Office estimate of H.R. 3 suggested it would free up $456 billion over 10 years. Even if Democrats had to settle on a less ambitious bill that produced less in savings, it'd be enough to pay for one of those other initiatives \u2015 and maybe more. Of course, the most direct and immediate benefit would be the one consumers would see at the pharmacy because their drugs would get cheaper. It's something Democrats have been promising for decades. If they fail to deliver, voters might notice.",

Roy Blunt (R-MO) the leading Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, noted Wednesday that Democrats had passed 100 state laws recently to change voting, while Republicans had passed only two such laws.\n\nBlunt was commenting on the Democrats\u2019 \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d also known as H.R.1 and S.1, which is an attempt to overhaul the nation\u2019s election system in radical ways that would virtually guarantee Republican defeat in future elections.\n\nIn addition to criticizing the text of the law, Blunt noted that Democrats\u2019 claims that their law was necessary to counteract Republican efforts to change voting at the state level were unfounded. While Republicans had introduced some 253 bills\u00a0to change voting, Democrats themselves had introduced 700. Moreover, 100 Democrat proposals had passed, and just two Republican ones. Those two, Blunt noted, had nothing to do with \u201cvoter suppression,\u201d as Democrats had falsely alleged:\n\n\u201cOne bill, in Arkansas, further defines the implementation of photo ID requirements,\u201d Blunt noted. \u201cAnd the other bill, in Utah, requires the lieutenant governor to send the Social Security list of deceased recipients to county clerks so they can initiate the process of removing the names of dead people from the voter rolls.\u201d Democrats called these \u201cvoter suppression.\u201d\n\nAmong the Democrat-proposed bills that became law, Blunt noted, was \u201cone Illinois law [that] requires the establishment of polling places in county jails so prisoners can vote.\u201d\n\nH.R. 1 (or S.1), he warned, included similar radical changes, such as creating unlimited nationwide ballot harvesting, in which party operatives could hand in an unlimited number of absentee ballots on behalf of other voters with few safeguards. He also said nationalizing elections would create chaos.\n\nBlunt also complained that committee chair Sen.

    "body": "he's led between two camps on the matter and throw his support behind one of the bills.  Advocates gathered outside the Maryland Democrat's district office to argue that H.R. 2070, a bill presented by Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.), is a compromise bill that would allow Puerto Ricans to study their options and choose anything from full independence to statehood.  \"We call on Leader Hoyer to show Democrats will abide by President Biden's commitment to bring together all sides of this debate. That is what H.R. 2070 does and that is the legislation Mr. Hoyer must champion in Congress. H.R. 2070 is the compromise. Period,\" said Melissa Mark-Viverito, chief policy officer at the Puerto Rican Cultural Center.  The Puerto Rican diaspora and advocacy groups were joined outside of Hoyer's office by representatives of Casa, a powerful grassroots immigrant rights organization with strong ties to the Maryland immigrant community.  Vel\u00e1zquez's bill is in direct competition with a proposal by Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n (R-P.R.) that favors statehood as a replacement for Puerto Rico's current territorial status.  \"We will not accept a one-sided, exclusionary, special interest driven bill that imposes Congress' will on Puerto Ricans,\" said Mark-Viverito of the Soto-Gonz\u00e1lez proposal.  Given the potential for conflict between two of the Democratic Caucus's most prominent members of Puerto Rican origin - Vel\u00e1zquez was born on the island and Soto is the first Florida representative of Puerto Rican descent - Hoyer quietly inserted himself in the conversation as a mediator between the two bills.  The negotiations have taken place strictly behind closed doors, presumably to avoid inflaming the passionate convictions that rule over the debate on Puerto Rico's sovereignty.  Story continues  \"Leader Hoyer continues to work alongside Members of the House Puerto Rican diaspora, Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and others towards agreement on a consensus bill that addresses the status of Puerto Rico. Conversations are ongoing, and Leader Hoyer continues to hope to have a bill ready for the House Floor as soon as possible,\" said Margaret Mulkerrin, a spokesperson for Hoyer.  But Hoyer's soft touch was derided by the activists outside his office as a lack of transparency.  \"Members of Congress should not be working behind closed doors and doing the bidding of conservative special interest money to hijack a fair, inclusive and transparent decolonization process already on the table. Yet, Rep. Hoyer is doing exactly this as Puerto Ricans have repeatedly and massively demonstrated against anti-democratic measures from Washington,\" said Erica Gonz\u00e1lez, director of the Power 4 Puerto Rico coalition.  The island's territorial status has been an immutable reality since the 1950s, but Puerto Rico's two-party system is split along support and opposition for statehood.  A smaller, vocal minority has historically supported independence, a position that's garnered support over the last decade.  The island's left-leaning political party has advocated for a hybrid status for decades known as the commonwealth - a designation that allowed Puerto Rico to adopt its own constitution, but that according to the State Department does not confer a sovereign status beyond that of other U.S. territories.  The State Department's position was bolstered by recent Supreme Court decisions, the territory's 2016 bankruptcy-like process and federal funding issues related to Hurricane Mar\u00eda, cementing the fact that Puerto Rico is constitutionally a territory.  At the core of the renewed push to revise the island's status are two groups: those who favor statehood and a coalition of opponents of statehood, proponents of independence and proponents of the commonwealth as a special status.  Proponents of statehood note Puerto Ricans have voted three times since 2012 in favor of statehood, under a variety of political circumstances, in non-binding referendums.  While statehooders view those referendums as a clear indication of popular will, the coalition around Vel\u00e1zquez's bill has been quick to note their non-binding nature, and has been critical of the conditions in which the referendums were organized.  The disagreement on the referendums is only the tip of the iceberg of differences between the two camps, which include fundamental constitutional arguments on the status options available to a post-territorial Puerto Rico.  Democrats stand to win support of a key demographic both on the island and in states like Florida and New York if they are seen as addressing the island's key political issue.  But Hoyer's foray into the debate may not be as quiet as he hoped for.  Mark-Viverito said the advocacy groups will take nothing short of Hoyer's full support for H.R. 2070, and are ready to take that fight to his district.  \"We are continuing to exert our voice. There are people here that are doing work in this district and we're going to continue to say to Steny Hoyer that that's what we want,\" said Mark-Viverito.  \"Until we have an ability to have a conversation directly with him and find out what's happening, we're going to continue to organize.\"",

H.R. 8 is universal background check legislation and NY Mag observed: \u201cThe last time legislation aimed at the gun-show loophole made it to the Senate floor \u2014 in a 2015 compromise proposal supported by [Sens.] Joe Manchin [D-WV] and Pat Toomey [R-PA] with a \u201cfamily friend\u201d exception for gun sales \u2014 it won only\u00a0four Republican votes, counting Toomey\u2019s, despite\u00a0overwhelming bipartisan public support.\n\nNY Mag then noted, \u201cSo long as the filibuster stays in place, there is no reasonable hope that enough Republicans will support any sort of firearms bill unless it\u2019s somehow blessed by the gun lobby as pro Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThey then threw the Atlanta shooting into the equation and asked, \u201cWill the fresh violence in Atlanta change the calculus in Washington?\u201d\n\nNY Mag concluded by suggesting that gun control has little hope of Senate passage as long as the filibuster remains in place.

Subscribe today. arrow-right Let's take H.R. 1 first. He does not state what provisions he likes or doesn't, nor does he suggest what compromise bill might reach 60 votes. So his objection is that Republicans object? Many bills that he supported came without Republican support \u2014 the American Rescue Plan, most recently, and of course, the Affordable Care Act. The notion that Republicans win simply by refusing to agree to any of the majority's legislative proposals makes a mockery of democracy, and specifically of the Senate. Indeed, Republicans' filibuster of the Jan. 6 commission legislation showed that we lack 10 Republicans willing to operate in good faith. Manchin also states that he prefers H.R. 4, which addresses only reauthorization of preclearance provisions. He argued, \u201cThe John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would update the formula states and localities must use to ensure proposed voting laws do not restrict the rights of any particular group or population. My Republican colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, has joined me in urging Senate leadership to update and pass this bill through regular order.\u201d But where are the 10 Republicans to support that measure ? Manchin is \u201cencouraged by the desire from both sides to transcend partisan politics and strengthen our democracy by protecting voting rights.\u201d Yet when 10 Republicans do not emerge for cloture on that either \u2014 just as we saw on the Jan. 6 commission bill \u2014 does Manchin simply give up? Story continues below advertisement It's time for Manchin to put up or share blame for Republicans' subversion of democracy. Let him come up with 10 Republicans for H.R. 4 and for a slimmed down H.R. 1. Let him find four more Republicans to support the Jan. 6 commission. If he cannot, then his thesis that the filibuster promotes debate and makes way for compromise collapses and his role in promoting the tyranny of the minority is laid bare. Manchin insisted that he will not \u201cweaken or eliminate\u201d the filibuster. He should be compelled to spell out what reforms he would accept. Is requiring Republicans to hold the floor (i.e., demanding a talking filibuster) \u201cweakening\u201d the rule? It is well past the time to start pressuring Manchin to answer some basic questions: If the filibuster is simply a means of thwarting any reasonable legislation, why is it worth preserving? What if the integrity of our democracy is at stake? Manchin's bland platitudes suggest he prefers stalemate to taking hard votes. The status quo leaves him with latitude to make holier-than-thou pronouncements to decry both sides. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Elevating the filibuster to the sine qua non of our constitutional system is absurd. It is not in the Constitution. It protects no constitutional principle. It does not constitute a check or balance on the other branches as, for example, a veto override or the Senate's advise and consent power on nominees. It does not protect minority rights when it is used to thwart voting rights protection for disfavored minorities. Moreover, the republic survived previous changes to the filibuster, such as reducing cloture to 60 votes, eliminating the filibuster for executive branch nominees and carving out budget reconciliation. There is no reason to assume another modification \u2014 one to ensure the fundamental right to vote \u2014 would be any more harmful. What are Democrats to do with someone so seemingly irrational and obstinate as Manchin? Advertisement Story continues below advertisement First, Democrats should compel Republicans to filibuster again and again the bills Manchin himself thinks are entirely reasonable. Bring up H.R. 4. Put the Jan. 6 commission back on the floor. After 5 or 6 of these rounds, Manchin's bipartisan fetish may subside. Second, Manchin's Democratic colleagues have a right to demand he present compromise legislation that has 10 Republicans. What magic formula is he aware of that has evaded others? Where are four more Republicans in addition to the six who would support the Jan. 6 commission? And finally, voters and voting rights activists need to confront Manchin civilly and peacefully, but with unrelenting demands for him to justify his position. An array of interest groups hurt by Republican obstruction and assaults on voting rights \u2014 e.g., organized labor, seniors, the disabled community \u2014 must turn up the heat. Most of all, Capitol Hill police and other law enforcement officials must demand passage of the Jan. 6 commission \u2014 or Manchin's agreement to push it through with less than 60 votes. They and the widows of law enforcement personnel killed from the Jan. 6 events need to be omnipresent and unrelenting. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement The time for Manchin's excuse-mongering is over. It is time to demonstrate his bipartisan notions are more than fantasy.

    "body": "March 17, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. GMT+1 Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1 , the For the People Act, a sweeping voting rights and ethics reform package. The bill, at nearly 800 pages , seeks to expand voting rights, reform campaign financing and strengthen ethics laws for members of Congress. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right While the bill was advanced by House Democrats, many of the electoral reforms mirror innovations supported and adopted by California Republicans. California's experience gives us a glimpse of how H.R. 1 might affect the United States, if signed into law. In California, the reforms have paved the way for a more involved electorate \u2014 including greater turnout from marginalized communities and more legislators of color being elected to office. Democrats moved Biden's pandemic relief bill quickly. Their work will get harder from here. H.R. 1 would install independent redistricting commissions in every state. California's already done this. Among other things, the bill calls for independent redistricting commissions in all 50 states. Currently, in most states, state legislatures redraw voting district maps themselves. As a result, whichever party holds the state legislative majority in a redistricting year can draw district lines that would give their party an advantage. For example, in 2010, Republicans controlled Pennsylvania's state legislature. Although more than 50 percent of Pennsylvania voters are registered Democrats, after the Republican-drawn map went into effect in 2012, Democrats won only five of the state's 18 congressional district races. In 2018, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court found that the state had been grossly gerrymandered to favor Republicans, and it ordered the state to redraw district lines California stripped redistricting power from the state legislature more than a decade ago. Pushed by the nonpartisan good governance organization Common Cause, California voters passed Proposition 11, the Voters First Act, in 2008, officially removing the legislature's responsibility to draw new state legislative districts and placing that task with an independent citizens redistricting commission. The move was heavily supported by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and at the time strongly opposed by House Speaker and California Democrat Nancy Pelosi. In 2010, voters broadened the commission's mandate by also giving it the power to draw district lines for U.S. congressional seats. The Citizens Redistricting Commission is charged with using a party-blind process that respects communities of interest. The 14-member commission includes five Democrats, five Republicans and four independents. Many of the state's Democrats feared this gave too much power to conservatives in the heavily Democratic state. Despite these concerns, the move toward independent redistricting is being replicated in other states. Arizona created a five-member commission in 2000 and this year, for the first time, Michigan will use an independent commission to redraw its lines. H.R. 1 would make it easier to vote. California did that already. H.R. 1 would also require states to make voting easier through such mechanisms as automatic voter registration, no-excuse vote-by-mail, postage-paid mail-in ballots and support for web-based voter registration. California tried these practices as part of the 2016 California Voter's Choice Act, which expanded access to early and more flexible voting. The nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that because of the reforms, more people cast ballots. While the report is fairly vague about which communities increased their voting rates, in 2020, California saw the largest voter turnout rate since 1952 , with most of the credit going to the state's decision to mail ballots to every registered voter To encourage more Californians to participate, California's reformers have worked to engage communities that have often felt alienated from elections, have been less likely to vote in the past or have been historically disenfranchised. To encourage such groups as racial or ethnic minority voters, newly naturalized citizens, rural voters, seniors and people with disabilities to engage, Proposition 11 charged California's independent redistricting commission with conducting robust public outreach and education before drawing its lines. The 2010 commission received more than 20,000 submissions from the public regarding which communities should be kept together when redrawing district boundaries. California's open top-two primary changes partisan dynamics California has also introduced a reform that's not in H.R. 1: an open top-two primary, which means that the top two vote-receiving candidates in a primary election advance to a general election regardless of party. First held in 2012, the change has resulted in a number of general elections in which both candidates are from the same party, such as the race for a U.S. Senate seat in 2016 between Democrats Kamala D. Harris and Loretta Sanchez. With Jane Junn, I recently conducted research that found that since these and other reforms \u2014 independent redistricting, term limits and the top-two primary \u2014 voters have elected more people of color to California's state legislature. In fact, between the years 2010 and 2016, when these reforms took place, the number of Latino/a legislators elected to California's state assembly and congressional delegation rose more than 10 percentage points. The Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act case could gut civil rights protections. Then what? Scholars and other observers generally agree that having larger proportions of citizens vote is one sign of a healthy democracy. Just now, 43 state legislatures are considering a total of more than 250 bills that would restrict voting. For instance, in Georgia, SB 241 would limit absentee voting, after the state sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate. The Supreme Court recently heard oral argument over the constitutionality of a 2016 Arizona law that banned collecting and delivering another person's completed ballot and that banned counting any provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct . The court decision in this case, Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee , could weaken the 1965 Voting Rights Act's protections against racial discrimination in voting. H.R. 1, designed to counter those incursions into voting rights, will now be considered by the Senate. In my earlier research, I've found that some communities of color, particularly Asian American and some Latinx communities , could be persuaded to support Republicans. Currently, members of these two groups report that political parties do not reach out to solicit their votes. While some state Democratic parties are working on such outreach , Republicans do not appear to be doing so. No Republican House members voted for H.R. 1. The bill appears unlikely to pass the evenly divided Senate unless Democrats change the filibuster rules Don't miss any of TMC's smart analysis! Sign up for our newsletter.

    "body": "Falls Church, Va., Feb. 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community Associations Institute (CAI) is honored to receive the 2022 Lobbying Strategy Innovation Award for its condominium safety policy response and initiatives by the Public Affairs Council (PAC). PAC is the leading nonpartisan association for public affairs professionals worldwide. CAI accepted the prestigious award today during the 2023 PAC Advocacy Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n Following the tragic partial collapse of Champlain Towers South condominium in Surfside, Fla., in June 2021, CAI released its Condominium Safety Public Policy Report . This report reflects the work of special task forces convened shortly after the condominium collapse to recommend changes to laws and best practices for the community association housing model that may help both communities and legislators better address building safety.\n  As the leading international organization for education, governance, and management of condominiums, housing cooperatives, and homeowners associations, CAI brought together the expertise, experience, and perspective of a wide range of stakeholders for the project. Participants included organizations representing engineers, insurance experts, building code officials, and local government leaders to condominium and cooperative board members, homeowners, community managers, attorneys, bankers, developers, insurance professionals, engineers, reserve study providers, and more. Over a three-month period, more than 600 people volunteered tremendous time and expertise through conversations, surveys, research, and interviews in CAI's process of identifying clear recommendations.\n  The Condominium Safety Public Policy Report provides extensive policy positions and recommendations in reserve studies and funding, building maintenance, and structural integrity.\n  Since the report's release, CAI's government and public affairs team has conducted outreach to state legislators and their staff and key individuals in federal housing agencies. Advocacy efforts at the federal level have resulted in the introduction of H.R. 7532, the Securing Access to Financing for Exterior Repairs (SAFER) in Condos Act, by former Florida Rep. Charlie Crist (D) and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.). Crist and Wasserman Schultz also introduced H.R. 8304, the Rapid Financing for Critical Condo Repairs Act of 2022. Florida, Illinois, Maryland, and Virginia passed laws consistent with CAI's public policy, ranging from reserve study requirements to comprehensive building inspection mandates.",

    "body": "The House of Representatives will vote Tuesday on whether to make Washington, D.C., a State.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), voted the bill, H.R. 51, out of committee by a vote of 25-19\u00a0to create D.C. statehood Wednesday.\n\nThe ultimate argument seems to be whether the 23rd Amendment guarantees the federal Capitol at least three electors in presidential elections,\u00a0Rep. Any Biggs (R-AZ)\u00a0suggested\u00a0Wednesday.\n\nBiggs\u2019 view is supported by legal scholars, who opposed D.C. statehood\u2019s feasibility without a Constitutional amendment to the 23rd Amendment. The Office of Legal Counsel in 2007\u00a0believed\u00a0it was unconstitutional,\u00a0the Justice Department under former President Reagan and former President Carter\u00a0stated\u00a0the transformation was unconstitutional, and so did Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, when he sat on the\u00a0D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Additionally, twenty-two state Attorneys General sent a letter Tuesday to President Joe Biden and Congress arguing Washington, D.C., cannot transition into a state via legislation, but only through the method of a Constitutional amendment. Our nation\u2019s capital was always meant to be unique. The founders wanted it to be a\u00a0federal district, existing beyond the confines or influence of any one state. H.R. 51 would require Congress to ignore the plain command of the 23rd Amendment. Even those who support D.C. statehood admit district residents enjoy special benefits due to where they live and would enjoy an outsize influence in Congress. The legislation is among those radical proposals the Democrats\u00a0introduced in Biden\u2019s first 100 days include: packing the courts, amnesty, reparations, federalized elections, D.C. statehood, and banning the Electoral College.",

    "body": "The debate over whether Black Americans should receive monetary compensation to make up for America\u2019s racist past reignited at a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, with advocates saying reparations would put the U.S. on a path to \u201crestorative justice\u201d and opponents dubbing the idea \u201cimpractical.\u201dPeople on both sides of the reparations debate testified during a virtual House subcommittee hearing on H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study and propose reparations for African-Americans in light of slavery and historic discrimination.Supporters say the long-proposed bill has because of last year\u2019s police-brutality protests, on Black Americans, and at the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\u201cNow more than ever, the facts and circumstances facing our nation demonstrate the importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of placing our nation on the path to reparative justice,\u201d the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas), said during the hearing held by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.Jackson Lee last month reintroduced House bill, which would establish a $12 million commission to study the history of slavery in the colonies and United States, the federal and state governments\u2019 role in supporting slavery, and discrimination against freed slaves and their descendants. The 13-member commission would also recommend \u201cappropriate remedies.\u201dBefore Jackson Lee took up the bill\u2019s mantle, the late Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.) had repeatedly reintroduced the legislation since 1989. The name H.R. 40 is a reference to the unfulfilled land-grant promise made to formerly enslaved people after the Civil War.The congresswoman, who submitted pictures of lynchings and brutalizations of Black Americans to be entered into the record, noted during the hearing that this would be \u201can active commission.\u201d \u201cIt is to study, but it is also to develop reparation proposals,\u201d she said.But the bill does not draw any conclusion about how to properly atone for the legacy of slavery, nor does it mandate financial payments or \u201cprejudge the outcome of the commission\u2019s work,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) added.\u201cInstead, it sets forth a process by which a diverse group of experts and stakeholders can study the complex issues involved and make recommendations,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cIn fact, most serious reparations models that have been proposed to date have focused on reparative community-based programs of employment, healthcare, housing and educational initiatives \u2014 righting wrongs that cannot be fixed with checks alone.\u201dRep. Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and newly elected Utah Republican who in a 2019 hearing and served as the ranking member on the subcommittee Wednesday, noted that his great-great-grandfather Silas \u201carrived here in the belly of a slave ship.\u201d But reparations are \u201cnot the way to right our country\u2019s wrong,\u201d he argued, calling the idea \u201cimpractical and a nonstarter.\u201dWednesday\u2019s hearing included testimony from California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, UCLA School of Law professor E. Tendayi Achiume, former NFL player Herschel Walker, attorney and conservative radio host Larry Elder, Human Rights Watch racial-justice researcher Dreisen Heath, Nikkei for Civil Rights & Redress co-chair Kathy Masaoka, and National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America national male co-chair Kamm Howard.Heath argued that \u201cif racial justice is ever to be achieved, \u2018repair\u2019 needs to be part of the equation.\u201d\u201cThe concept of reparations is well established in international human-rights law. At its core is the idea that economic and social conditions cannot improve without addressing and repairing harm,\u201d Heath said. \u201cThe U.S. has never fully or properly reckoned with the gross human-rights violation of chattel slavery and the post-emancipation racist policies that continue to impact Black people in the U.S. today.\u201dAnd Achiume, an expert in international human-rights law, added that while popular conceptions of reparations tended to be relatively narrow and focus only on financial compensation, the international system emphasizes a more comprehensive approach that may also include transforming political, economic and social institutions.\u201cReparations for slavery are an integral part of fulfilling the international legal mandate to eliminate racial discrimination,\u201d Achiume added. \u201cThe United States is not exempt from these responsibilities, and H.R. 40 would represent important progress in fulfilling its obligations under international law.\u201dWeber, who was sworn in last month as California\u2019s first Black secretary of state, spoke of her efforts spearheading as a California assemblywoman to establish a task force to study the issue of reparations for descendants of enslaved people. That effort, she said, should not preclude the potential for reparations at the federal level.\u201cOut of all due respect, Californians can no longer wait for the national government to do its job,\u201d Weber said. \u201cWe believe that we must do what is necessary for Californians and be an example of what can happen in this nation when there is serious discussion and research done on African Americans and the impact of slavery.\u201dMasaoka, meanwhile, wove together Japanese Americans\u2019 and Black Americans\u2019 respective fights for reparations and reiterated her organization\u2019s support for H.R. 40. Japanese Americans for their incarceration during World War II.\u201cIt was important for Japanese Americans to determine our own path toward redress and reparations, and we fully stand behind the Black community as they determine their own path forward,\u201d she said. Reparations for Black Americans are \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d and \u201clong overdue,\u201d she added.But Walker, a prominent supporter of former President Donald Trump who spoke at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention, raised questions about how reparations would play out in practice.\u201cWhere would the money come from? Does it come from all the other races except the Black taxpayers?\u201d he said. \u201cWho is Black? What percent of Black must you be to receive reparations? Do you go to 23 and Me or a DNA test to determine the percentage of Blackness?\u201dAnd Elder, who also opposes reparations, said he found it \u201cironic\u201d that this conversation was taking place 13 years after the country elected its first Black president. \u201cReparations is the extraction of money from people who were never slave owners to be given to people who were never slaves,\u201d he added in released ahead of the hearing.H.R. 40 was previously the subject of a June 19, 2019 congressional hearing that included testimony from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, actor Danny Glover and Sen. Cory Booker (D, N.J.), who also introduced a Senate companion bill.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), said in 2019 he believed reparations and that \u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black GOP senator, also rejected the idea: \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations help level the playing field \u2014 it might help more eruptions on the playing field,\u201d he said last year.Ultimately, almost every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate threw their support behind the idea of studying potential reparations proposals. President Joe Biden that his administration would support a study of reparations, but he has not specifically backed H.R. 40.White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Wednesday that Biden supports studying reparations. \u201cAnd he continues to demonstrate his commitment to take comprehensive action to address the systemic racism that persists today,\u201d Psaki added, pointing to an executive order Biden signed on his first day in office to.Smaller efforts to consider reparations have also arisen in recent years. Schools like Georgetown University, for example, have and sought to compensate descendants of enslaved people through various means. The Evanston, Ill., city council has also committed to putting toward reparations, and the city council in Asheville, N.C. approved a resolution last July supporting for Black residents.",

But there is no indication that there would be 10 Republican senators willing to vote for it to overcome a filibuster, with some Republicans already throwing cold water on the prospect of passing such a bill. Manchin has also made clear he does not support eliminating the filibuster requirement to lower the voting threshold for passage. Manchin told reporters Tuesday morning that his meeting with the NAACP and other civil rights activists was \"constructive,\" and called them the \"most respectful group I've spoken to in a long time,\" but that the discussion did not change his mind on S.1. \"I don't think anybody changed positions on that, we're just learning where everybody's coming from,\" Manchin said.

    "body": "A bill that narrowly won approval in the U.S. House of Representatives could become the country's most comprehensive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure requirements ever, with specific reporting expectations on climate risks, political spending, CEO pay, and taxation rates. It's uncertain if the Senate will pass the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act, or H.R. 1187 , which squeaked by on a 215-214 House vote. But, it signals congressional intent to expand the scope of information available to investors while offering hints of how future ESG disclosure frameworks could look. But first, some context from around the world The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a steady flow of statements on climate and is expected to propose enhanced rules this fall. The House bill would explicitly require the SEC to issue specific ESG reporting requirements. That could help the U.S. catch up to the European Union. There, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) applies to financial market participants and advisors and aims to steer capital toward sustainable investments through mandated ESG reporting. The European Commission also has proposed the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to require even unlisted companies to report how sustainability issues affect their businesses, as well as how their businesses affect people and the environment. It's possible the SEC could mirror some of the CSRD's requirements in areas such as data tagging or audits of sustainability disclosures. Even without specific requirements, investors are demanding more transparency , as we saw this proxy season. Shareholders raised questions about ESG, sparking debate about the materiality of ESG, risk, and how companies can authentically show their impacts on stakeholders. A Workiva survey of individual investors in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, and Germany showed 70% agree companies should be responsible for demonstrating their ESG performance; 64% agreed ordinary investors should pressure companies to be more transparent. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures help investors understand how their capital is being used. That way, they can more effectively allocate their money in line with their strategy and beliefs. 9 hints of where ESG disclosures are going By deconstructing H.R. 1187, one can see where legislators want to expand transparency and accountability. For instance, the bill would strengthen SEC rules on disclosures related to human capital and climate change while adding details on political contributions and, according to the bill, \"disclosure of tax havens.\" The bill would broadly require a public company to disclose certain ESG metrics and their connection to the long-term business strategy. Again, there's no telling what the bill will look like if the Senate moves on it. But, looking at the categories of disclosure that it covers, at least some in Washington are thinking about ESG (you can read the full bill for all the details Shareholder Political Transparency Political contributions, with a description of spending on political activities, including dates, amounts, and details of who got the money Greater Accountability in Pay More details on executive pay including: Percentage increase in the median of the annual total compensation of all executive officers over the last completed fiscal year Percentage increase in the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, excluding executive officers, over the last completed fiscal year Comparison data Climate Risk Disclosure Direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, total amount of fossil fuel-related assets, and potentially even the amount of water withdrawn from freshwater sources for operations Disclosure of Tax Havens and Offshoring Financial performance and taxes on a country-by-country basis Workforce Investment Disclosure Specific workforce disclosures including: Number of full- and part-time and contingent (temporary, contract) employees Workplace demographics Turnover rates and internal hiring and promotion rates Diversity policies, audits, and programming expenditures Information about training and cross-training of employees Frequency, severity, and lost time due to injuries, illness, and fatalities Findings of harassment or discrimination Pay and benefits, including policies regarding how performance, productivity, equity, and sustainability are considered when setting pay and making promotions Recruiting and needs, including share of new jobs requiring a college degree Preventing and Responding to Workplace Harassment Number of settlements reached and payments of settlements, judgments, and awards related to harassment Cybersecurity Disclosure Whether any member of the governing body has cybersecurity expertise Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Demographic data on the board of directors, board nominees, and executive officers, based on voluntary self-identification of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and veteran status Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Whether the company or affiliates imported goods made in a region associated with forced labor The bill also would direct the SEC to study the issues small businesses face with respect to disclosing ESG metrics. In addition, we wouldn't be surprised if companies eventually are asked to make ESG disclosures in a machine-readable format, perhaps with XBRL(R) tags. The big takeaway No matter the fate of H.R. 1187, regulators ultimately may require new disclosures to meet the growth in ESG investments and demands for transparency. With so much capital at stake, investors are the ones looking for data they can trust and comparability. All told, public companies might want to prepare for: Dramatically expanded ESG reporting requirements New formats for ESG disclosures Audit assurance of sustainability disclosures, which will certainly raise the stakes for this reporting Any or all of those changes will likely drive companies toward ESG disclosure software or technology to address reporting risks and simplify how teams aggregate and report ESG data Are you ready?

Mark Robinson (R-NC) said on Thursday it was \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cinsulting\u201d for Democrats to frame black Americans as incapable of obtaining a photo ID to comply with voter-ID laws.\n\nRobinson was invited to testify as a witness before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing entitled, \u201cOversight of the Voting Rights Act: The Evolving Landscape of Voting Discrimination.\u201d Democrats and the broader left regularly frame voter-ID laws as racially discriminatory against blacks, including comparisons between such regulations and Jim Crow laws.\n\nAm I to believe that black Americans \u2014 who have overcome the atrocities of slavery, who were victorious in the civil rights moment, and now sit in the highest levels of this government \u2014 cannot figure out how to get a free ID to secure their votes? They need to be coddled by politicians because they don\u2019t think we can figure out how to make our voices heard Are you kidding me? The notion that black people must be protected from a free ID to secure their votes is not just insane, it is insulting.\n\nRobinson observed the subtext of Democrat narratives regarding voter-ID laws:\n\nMy father-in-law was in prison for 43 years \u2014 a black man in prison for 43 years \u2014 very first thing he did when he got out of prison was get a driver\u2019s license.\u00a0Where is this no access to IDs that exists? Why do we look at poor people and brown people and think that they\u2019re less than, and that they can\u2019t figure out how our systems work, they can\u2019t figure out where the DMV is, they can\u2019t figure out where this agency is to go down and get this ID that is being offered? I can\u2019t express to you how insulting this is for someone to look at me and actually say that the reason why we don\u2019t need IDs to vote is because you and your people can\u2019t find your way down to get one.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) asked if \u201crampant voter discrimination\u201d took place in North Carolina or the broader United States.\n\nRobinson said, \u201cA systematic effort to suppress the votes of black people, that is\u00a0preposterous, just as preposterous as the notion that as a black American, I can\u2019t get a free ID to vote.\u201d\n\nHe described Democrats\u2019 push for federalization of elections as \u201ca partisan unconstitutional power grab.\u201d\n\nRobinson noted Clarence Henderson, who participated in a sit-in protest against racial segregation laws at a Woolworth lunch counter in 1960 in Greensboro, NC, was not invited to join an event on Monday headed by Vice President Kamala Harris to commemorate the demonstration.\n\nThis is doesn\u2019t have anything to do with justice. This has everything to do with power.\u00a0Just a few days ago, the vice president went to the very place that I mentioned, the Woolworth counter in Greensboro. But you know who wasn\u2019t there, you know who wasn\u2019t invited? My good friend Clarence Henderson, who is a civil rights icon. He sat at that counter and endured the suffering and pain to make sure that black voices were heard, and why was he left out? Because he\u2019s of a different political persuasion.\u00a0 You might ask why this is so and I\u2019ll tell you plainly. The goal of some individuals in government is not to hear the voices of black Americans, at all. It is to hear the voices that fit their narratives, and ultimately help keep power with one group, and that\u2019s what this all is all about. It\u2019s about power.\n\nRobinson addressed H.R. 1\u2019s \u2014 Democrat legislation dubbed the For the People Act \u2014 proposed changes to election laws.\n\n\u201cH.R. 1 [is] despicable,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe entire thing is designed to keep one party in power and make sure they stay there indefinitely. \u2026 They plan to do that by taking away the rights of states given by the Constitution to govern their own elections.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201c[H.R. 1 would use] government dollars to fund campaigns in order to give an advantage to one party, mandating that felons are allowed to vote \u2014 including illegal immigrants on voter rolls \u2014 and of course, trying to banish states from having voter ID.\u201d",

H.R.\nMcMaster called Putin's nuclear threats \"suicide.\"  McMaster told CBS that Putin's threats should not shift the West's support for Ukraine.  It comes as Putin has been scrambling amid the ongoing war and making warnings to use nuclear weapons.  Former national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R.

The world has been considering how to handle Putin's to launch nuclear weapons amid the months-long war with Ukraine.

During an interview with CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" moderator Margaret Brennan asked McMaster who served as one of President Donald Trump's national security advisers, his thoughts on what the response should be in the wake of Putin's threats.  \"I think the message to him is if you use a nuclear weapon, it's a suicide weapon,\" he said.  \"And the response from NATO and the United States doesn't have to be nuclear,\" he added, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance of various nations.

Masaoka said winning reparations gave the Japanese American community strength, a chance to stand up and a sense of responsibility. Now she wants the Black community to have the same.\n\n\"I think we always felt very connected to other communities of color and saw similarities of our own situations,\" Masaoka, the co-chair of Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress, told CNN. \"We can fight for it and if we do link together and build solidarity, we can change this country and we can all heal,\" she said.\n\nMasaoka's organization is among an increasingly diverse group of Americans pushing for reparations for Black Americans. Groups like the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism Japanese American Citizens League and Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress have become allies in the push to find corrective solutions to systemic disparities that impact some Black Americans. This allyship comes at a time when legislation like H.R. 40 -- which proposes the creation of a federal commission to study reparations and recommend remedies for the harm caused by slavery and the discriminatory policies that followed abolition -- is gaining momentum in Washington, its sponsor Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee says.\n\nReparations efforts are also being seen across states, cities, municipalities and historical institutions, as they have begun to explore new ways to address past transgressions.\n\nThese ongoing conversations at various levels have been spearheaded by Black people supporting the quest for reparations, but other communities are now joining in support.\n\nRep. Lee, who reintroduced H.R. 40 last year, told CNN the fact that other communities have received reparations on a federal government level shows Congress they can do the same for Black people.\n\nEarly last year, the bill was advanced by the House Judiciary Committee in a 25-17 vote and now faces a full House vote. Rep. Lee is hopeful and says that over 200 of her colleagues are ready to vote to pass the bill. But she is also aware the bill faces pushback in the Senate vote and urges her colleagues to understand that enslaved Black people created the economic engine from which the nation was built.\n\nSupport for reparations from people outside the Black community is a sign that Jewish and Japanese American communities are on the side of justice, Kamm Howard says.\n\nHoward, who is the National Male Co-Chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, says if the federal government made attempts to address the harm inflicted on other communities, it's only right that lawmakers figure out a way to grant reparations to Black Americans.\n\n\"There's been no attempt by the American government to specifically address the harms and continued harms inflicted upon us,\" Howard told CNN.\n\nYolanda Savage-Narva is the director of racial equity, diversity and inclusion at the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the part of the Union for Reform Judaism that focuses on advocacy and social justice work.\n\n\"Our organization really understood that the call for the study of reparations was a Jewish moral call,\" she told CNN. \"There is an imperative around making sure that every party of our humanity is seen as equitable human beings and the call for reparations was a move for the reformed Jewish community to really put a stake in the ground.\"\n\nSavage-Narva said she believes this adds to the support and shows the US that acknowledging and paying reparations is an important step in the healing process.\n\n\"The German government really did what they needed to do with truth and reconciliation, and have made a commitment to, as much as possible, making an effort to repair the harm that was done,\" she said. \"Because the Jewish community has had its own historic trauma, they can make that connection and understand how important the process of reparations is.\"\n\nThe Japanese American community was one of the first communities to receive redress from the US government and has been supporting the movement for reparations for decades.\n\nJapanese Americans who interned in concentration camps in the US during World War II from 1942 until about 1946 received reparations as part of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. More than four decades after their imprisonment, the law gave each surviving former internee $20,000.\n\n\"One of the reasons we understand the importance of reparations is looking at Japanese American redress and reparations,\" Kato-Kiriyama told CNN. \"It did take the support of all kinds of people to come together, and we couldn't have done it on our own.\"\n\nDavid Inoue, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, said supporting the movement to pass H.R. 40 is the right thing to do and will lead to further comprehension and response to the \"current injustices ingrained in the system.\"\n\nInoue told CNN he believes Congress is in a very different place since Japanese Americans received reparations.\n\n\"The more of us who speak out, the harder it will be to ignore us and our country's responsibility to address and respond to this historic injustice,\" Inoue said.\n\n\"We do need federal reparations\"\n\n\"All of these efforts, no matter where they are happening, are important and good to keep pushing forward,\" Kato-Kiriyama told CNN. \"It also reminds us that we don't have to wait for one huge federal bill, although we do need federal reparations.\"\n\nNationally, the movement for reparations is expected to take some time.\n\nExperts say that if the bill advances past the House, it faces opposition from some Democrats and most Republicans -- and it's unlikely to have enough votes for a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.\n\n\"We're knocking on the door of H.R. 40 being enacted either by legislation or more likely by executive order,\" he said. \"That is a major moment in American history.\"\n\nHoward said the bill would look at these continuous injuries, among others, to define the degree of harm the Black community has suffered and continues to suffer.\n\n\"There is a rise today of racism against African Americans and the push has to be: why has American not been able to find a pathway to ease the tensions of race?\" Rep. Lee told CNN. \"Every time we move on something brings us back to the issues of race. This bill offers an opportunity to bring people together by understanding.\"",

    "body": "The year 2020 saw Americans\u00a0across political and demographic lines\u00a0embrace their Second Amendment rights in unprecedented numbers. Last week, Representative Richard Hudson (R-NC)\u00a0reintroduced H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would give more meaningful effect to those rights by ensuring they stay intact as travelers crossed state lines.\n Forty-two states and the District of Columbia routinely issue concealed carry permits to all qualified applicants. The norm among these states is to have reciprocity agreements to give effect to those permits beyond the issuing state. States are also increasingly passing universal recognition laws for all concealed carry permits. And 16 states recognize a right to carry concealed without a permit. (Detailed information\u00a0is available\u00a0on the NRA-ILA\u2019s website.)\n Yet a handful of anti-gun states where concealed carry permits are issued on a discretionary basis continue to deny non-resident concealed carriers any recognition at all. This creates traps for unwary travelers, who \u2013 having made a point of jumping through the legal hoops to carry lawfully \u2013 believe these efforts will be given full faith and credit by other jurisdictions.\u00a0Stories abound\u00a0of travelers facing years in prison for the carrying of a concealed firearm that they innocently believed was covered by their permit or that was otherwise lawful in their state of residence.\n H.R. 38\u00a0would correct these injustices. It would recognize the right of travelers to carry who:\n   May lawfully possess and receive a firearm under federal law.\n Are carrying photographic identification issued by the U.S. or a state government.\n Have a concealed carry permit or reside in a state that otherwise provides for lawful concealed carry.\n \n To carry in other states that provide a means of lawful concealed carry for the state\u2019s own residents.\n These travelers would be able to carry in other states that provide for lawful concealed carry for that\u2019s state\u2019s own residents and will have to obey any laws that establish prohibited places for firearms or concealed carry. Private property owners, moreover, would maintain discretion over whether or to what degree concealed carry was authorized on their property.",

    "body": "federal American Indian laws, a move that again puts the Democrat at odds with Maine's tribes and most of her party.  The bill was sponsored by Golden, D-2nd District, and cosponsored by Rep. Chellie Pingee, D-1st District. Mills also is breaking with President Biden's administration, which supports the legislation.  In a letter from her chief legal counsel, Gerald Reid, Mills made it clear she is committed to the framework created by the controversial 1980 land claims settlement acts, which deprive Maine's tribes of a wide range of sovereign powers and privileges enjoyed by the United States' other 570 federally recognized tribes. Congress, Reid wrote, should not intervene to change the terms of the 42-year-old act and the tribes should negotiate with the state for changes, as the settlement envisioned.  \"We object to its categorical approach to making federal laws applicable in Maine, which would erode the Settlement Acts' foundational jurisdictional compromise,\" Reid wrote in a letter submitted to the House indigenous affairs subcommittee. \"Questions of whether federal statutes should be made applicable in Maine should be answered on a case-by-case basis so that the effects of each such decision on Tribal lands and adjacent non-tribal communities can be thoroughly evaluated and understood.\"  Reid blasted Golden's bill \u2014 H.R. 6707, the Advancing Equality for Wabanaki Nations Act \u2014 for attempting to change the terms of the land claims settlement without the state of Maine's consent.  \"The Mills Administration was not consulted in the development or drafting of H.R. 6707, and we learned about the bill only shortly before it was printed in the House,\" he wrote. \"If Congress were to amend (the federal settlement act) at the request of only one party, it would set a troubling precedent that disincentivizes negotiation between the settling parties, and instead encourages those parties to petition Congress continually seeking their preferred amendments, all of which would be dependent on the politics of the moment. That result would serve no one's interest.\"  Story continues  The stance appears to make it likely that Mills will veto a wide-ranging state bill, L.D. 1626, passed by the Democratic-controlled Maine House this week and Senate on Friday that would ensure all federal Indian laws \u2014 past and future \u2014 apply to Maine's tribes.  Mills' office did not respond to an interview request about Golden's federal bill or to written questions asking if she intended to veto the state bill if it came to her desk.  Golden's bill would amend the federal law that governs the historic 1980 agreement to remove one of several restrictions on their sovereignty. In the 1980 negotiations to settle the tribes' claim to two-thirds of the state, Maine demanded that no federal Indian law \u2014 past or future \u2014 that undermined Maine's authority would apply to the Maine tribes unless Congress specifically included them.  None of the 570 other federally recognized tribes in the United States faces similar encumbrances. The provisions in the law, the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, excluded Maine tribes from the provisions of the Indian Gaming Act (which allows and regulates tribal casinos), the Stafford Act (which allows tribes to seek federal disaster relief funds), the Indian Health Improvement Act (which allows tribes to employ medical professionals licensed in another state), the Violence Against Women Act (which allowed tribes to prosecute non-Indian defendants for domestic violence crimes on their reservations), and other laws.  Unlike the state bill passed by the Maine House and Senate, Golden's congressional bill would only apply to future laws, though it has language that would allow the Houlton Band of Maliseet and the Mi'kmaq to join the other two Maine tribes in benefiting from the Indian Child Welfare Act. That 1978 law increases a tribal court's authority in child custody matters and limits a state's ability to remove Indian children from their families.  The Biden administration has also come out in support of Golden's bill. \"H.R. 6707 ensures that, moving forward, the Wabanaki Nations are governed by federal beneficial laws,\" the U.S. Department of Interior said in a written submission to the subcommittee. \"The Department supports H.R. 6707.\"  The Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission, a joint state-tribal body created by the settlement acts as a forum to discuss problems, submitted testimony saying the acts had \"been interpreted and applied unilaterally by the State in ways that have been harmful to the Wabanaki communities, and by extension, neighboring rural Maine non-tribal communities that could otherwise have benefited from new federal laws.\"  On Wednesday, Democratic leaders of the Maine House and Senate also submitted testimony backing the bill, which they called \"modest and narrowly tailored.\" They said the bill had strong popular support and \"should be viewed as noncontroversial.\"  Golden's bill received strong support from representatives of Maine's tribes at a virtual hearing on March 31, but was opposed by the Maine Forest Products Council over concerns about the creation of new jurisdictions in Maine. In their questions, several Democratic members of the congressional subcommittee indicated they strongly supported the bill and were not impressed with Maine's position.  \"We cannot have a group of tribal nations treated differently in their sovereignty than other tribal nations in this country,\" said Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota.  But the ranking Republican expressed concern about Congress acting without Maine's consent. \"I hope maybe as this process continues we can find some way of navigating this that gets these resources to the tribes without overriding the jurisdiction of the state,\" Rep. Jay Obernolte of California said.  The bill has a long road to becoming law, including jumping the hurdles to make it to a U.S. House floor vote and then needing the approval of the Senate and Biden's signature.",

Byron Donalds slammed President Biden on Friday for invoking Jim Crow during his first formal press conference, saying he is \"irresponsibly injecting race\" into the conversation.\nBiden on Thursday,\u00a0during his first press conference\u00a0since taking office, referenced Jim Crow when defending the Democrats' H.R. 1 voting reform bill\u00a0and their efforts to get rid of the filibuster.\nBIDEN SAYS FILIBUSTER IS BEING ABUSED, THREATENS TO BACK CHANGES IF LEGISLATION STALLS\u00a0\n\"In 2005, then-Sen. Biden said, 'At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill; it is about compromise and moderation. That is why the Founders put unlimited debate in. That is what it is about, engendering compromise and moderation,'\" Donalds, of Florida, told Fox News.\n\"Fast-forward to today, and now President Biden is irresponsibly injecting race and the travesty of Jim Crow to oppose the filibuster,\" Donalds said. \"Time after time, Democrats resort to the race card to shield them from having to answer for their hypocrisy and radical policies.\"\n\"Jim Crow might not mean anything to President Biden, considering he joined segregationists in opposing bussing and eulogized known racists like Robert Byrd, but that dark stain on our republic is personal to me and many Black Americans like me,\" Donalds said.\nDonalds went on to call elections the \"cornerstone of our constitutional republic.\"\n\"Ensuring elections take place legally and adequately isn't racist; it is righteous,\" Donalds told Fox News, slamming H.R. 1, the For the People Act,\u00a0as a \"direct assault on our Constitution and the sanctity of our election system\" while saying, if passed into law, it would \"do irreparable harm to the future of our republic.\"\n\"The Constitution outlines the responsibility of administering elections, and that power is for the states, not the federal government,\" Donalds said. \"Abolishing voter I.D. laws, ending signature verification, and putting into place taxpayer-funded campaigns is detrimental to every American's right to a free and fair election\u2014and the harmful rhetoric of President Biden cannot evade this fact.\"\nDonalds' comments come after Biden invoked Jim Crow in speaking about the filibuster\u00a0and about proposed reforms to voting laws in states across the country.\nBiden said Thursday he \"strongly support[s]\" reforming the silent filibuster to a \"talking\" filibuster, in which\u00a0senators who want to block legislation would have to hold the floor by talking endlessly. He cited statistics that there were just 58 motions to break a filibuster from 1917 to 1971, but just last yea, there were \"five times that many.\"\nBiden said he agreed with former President\u00a0Obama's assessment that the filibuster was a \"Jim Crow relic.\" He expressed disgust for actions states are taking to clamp down on voting, alluding to new election reforms in Georgia that even ban giving away food and water to voters waiting in line to vote.\nBiden was also asked whether he worries that Republicans in states across the country proposing legislation to curb voting access could cost Democrats control of Congress during the 2022 midterms.\n\"I\u2019m convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing\u2014this makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,\" he said.\nBIDEN SAYS GOP STATE VOTING LEGISLATION 'MAKES JIM CROW LOOK LIKE JIM EAGLE'\nBiden added: \"This is gigantic what they\u2019re trying to do and it cannot be sustained.\"\nBiden was referring to Republican lawmakers in battleground states who are pushing to tighten voting restrictions on mail balloting and more in future elections.\nMeanwhile, the House passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021 \u2014\u00a0 which Democrats claim will expand voting rights and \"clean up corruption\" in politics.\nAccording to Democrats, the bill would \"improve access to the ballot box\" by creating an automatic voter registration across the country and by ensuring that individuals who have completed felony sentences have their full voting rights restored. The bill will also expand early voting and enhance absentee voting by simplifying voting by mail.\n\n      Bryon Donalds, R-Fla. (Marisa Schultz/Fox News)\n      \n\n\nThe legislation also \"ensures that American elections are decided by American voters\" by enhancing federal support for voting system security, specifically with regard to paper ballots, and also by increasing oversight of election system vendors and by requiring the \"development of a national strategy to protect U.S. democratic institutions.\"\nThe Senate is now considering S.1, which Democrats say is a critical civil rights bill needed to protect Americans' right to vote in the face of GOP-controlled state legislatures that have introduced bills to tighten voting restrictions.\n\"Our move to equality, our move to fairness has been inexorable. But it didn't happen on its own, it took mighty movements and decades of fraught\" political fights, said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., making a rare committee appearance Wednesday. \"I would like to ask my Republican colleagues, why are you so afraid of democracy?\"\nSchumer said S.1 would \"combat all of these voter suppression efforts by restoring critical parts of the Voting Rights Act ... make it easier \u2014 not harder \u2014 to vote by automatically registering American voters when they get a driver's license ... [and] limit dark money and corruption in our politics, and much more.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a podcast released Tuesday, argued Democrats are trying to use the levers of power to give them a long-term political advantage despite the fact they hold the slimmest of majorities in both the House and Senate. \u00a0\nSCHUMER, MCCONNELL SPAR OVER DEMS' S1 ELECTION BILL DURING RARE COMMITTEE APPEARANCE: 'SHAME!'\nMcConnell spoke on the conservative \"Ruthless\" podcast, where he assailed Democrats over their planned bills on elections, H.R.1 and S.1; attempts to add new states to the Union; efforts to remove the legislative filibuster and more.\n\"They want to change the system to benefit themselves and they want to have instead of a referee they want the FEC to be a prosecutor,\" McConnell, R-Ky., said, referencing HR.1 and S.1.\n\"So this is not about anything other than trying to help the Democrats win elections in perpetuity,\" he added.\nFox News' Marisa Schultz, Tyler Olson and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

Take a look what\u2019s actually in it.\u201d\n He then described that the goal of the bill \u201cis to expand access to voting and ensure that elections aren\u2019t rigged by special interests.\u201d He added that it would be done \u201cthrough national standards\u201d on things like voter registration, absentee balloting, redistricting, donor disclosure, among other things.\n \u201cThis is ambitious stuff \u2026 But is it really that scary? Put all the partisan rhetoric aside and just ask yourself whether these provisions would make it easier or harder for every eligible citizen to vote? This isn\u2019t complicated, but it is important, because strengthening democracy shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. It\u2019s an American responsibility,\u201d Avlon concluded.\n \u201cDoes the Devil use Microsoft Word or Google Docs when he\u2019s writing legislation in hell? That\u2019s what I want to know\u201d Berman said to the laughter of his co-hosts, in reference to Lee\u2019s claim about the bill.\n The House passed H.R. 1 on Mar. 4 and will head to the Senate, where it is expected to face stiff Republican opposition. The bill is seen as a major overhaul with potential long-lasting effects. It largely takes away states\u2019 powers when it comes to certain aspects of elections, including mandating allowing mail-in voting without demanding identification.",

    "body": "The House is set to vote Thursday on legislation that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, marking the first congressional move on significant gun control since Democrats won the White House and the majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, H.R. 8 , would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers. The legislation has three Republican cosponsors -- Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan, Chris Smith of New Jersey and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.\n\nSeparate legislation, H.R. 1446 , introduced by Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and called the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, would close what's known as the \"Charleston Loophole,\" which allows some licensed gun sales to go through before a required background check is done. Using that loophole, Dylann Roof was able to legally purchase a firearm to kill nine people at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\n\"These people who were practicing their faith, their faith that taught them to welcome in a stranger, a stranger came to their door and they welcomed into their Bible study, he sat with them for an hour,\" Clyburn said on the House floor Wednesday. \"The stranger that they had welcomed in had opened fire and killed nine of them, one of who was the pastor, a former intern of mine.\"\n\n\"This law would have prevented that gentleman from getting a gun,\" Clyburn added.\n\nThe bills are expected to pass the House but will face an uphill climb in the Senate as Democrats hold a slim 50-50 majority and would need significant Republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster. Still, the legislation remains a priority for the Biden administration. \"I will say that the President is somebody, throughout his career, who has advocated for smart gun -- smart gun safety measures,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said during a White House briefing last month, adding that the President is \"not afraid of standing up to the NRA -- he's done it multiple times and won -- on background checks and a range of issues. And it is a priority to him on a personal level.\" While introducing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California said on the House floor he hopes his colleagues support the legislation. \"What the bill does do is close the private gun sale loophole which has made it easy for felons and other prohibited purchasers to buy a gun online at gun shows or other person to person sales,\" Thompson, the chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force in the House, said. But despite three Republicans cosponsoring the legislation, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise urged all members of his party to vote against the legislation on Thursday. The Louisiana Republican argued GOP members should vote against the two bills because H.R. 1446 would create \"arbitrary delays on background checks that will infringe upon millions of Americans' Second Amendment right to defend themselves and their families,\" and -- in regard to H.R. 8 -- that \"federal law already strictly prohibits transferring firearms in certain situations to ensure firearms are not transferred to prohibited individuals.\" Brian Lemek -- the executive director of Brady PAC, the sister organization of gun violence prevention group the Brady Campaign -- told CNN he hopes the House votes to pass the legislation, which he called \"commonsense solution to save lives and keep guns out of the hands of people who we all can agree should not have them.\"",

    "body": "In this article:  Joe Biden  Civil and human rights organizations tell theGrio they have grown frustrated with the White House's lack of movement on what they say is no longer a fringe issue.\n Civil and human rights groups are calling out the Biden administration for its apparent reluctance to take executive action to create a commission to study slavery and reparations in the United States.  Calls to address the socioeconomic harms caused by the country's \u201coriginal sin\u201d through reparative measures were recently renewed following the mass shooting of 10 African Americans at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, last month.  Despite growing outside pressure from the movement for reparations, the White House will not commit to President Biden signing an executive order. During a White House press briefing last week, theGrio asked Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre if the president would create the commission through executive action.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre answers questions on June 13, 2022, during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)  In her response, Jean-Pierre reiterated what she had said earlier in June when asked about the executive order in response to a question about California releasing its own state task force on proposals to develop reparations. \u201cThe president's position hasn't changed,\u201d the presidential spokeswoman told theGrio.  On the record, President Biden supports a reparations commission and would sign H.R. 40 if passed by Congress. The bill would create a reparations commission by law. However, it has yet to come to a vote in this session of Congress, and given the lack of support from Republicans, it is unlikely to pass in the current U.S. Senate.  Advocates say given the political reality of H.R. 40 in the legislative branch, Biden using the power of the executive branch is the only viable path to creating the commission.  \u201cWe know that we could get it passed in the House of Representatives, but it would only be a moral victory,\u201d Ron Daniels, convenor of the National African-American Reparations Commission (NAARC), told theGrio. \u201cWe don't want a moral victory. We want an actual victory.\u201d  Story continues  As previously reported, a source told theGrio that Democratic leadership is reluctant to bring H.R. 40 to a floor vote for fear that it could lead to blowback for the party in the months leading into the . However, Daniels said the decision to halt H.R. 40 was intentional and that Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip James Clyburn are all in support of bringing the bill to the vote.  All sources contend that the best strategy on reparations is through executive order until more Democrats are elected into Congress. As advocates turn their attention to the White House, some say they have grown frustrated with the Biden administration's lack of movement on what they say is no longer a fringe issue.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)  \u201cI think there's some fear that is rooted in [the idea that] we have to stay away from Black issues if we're going to win,\u201d said Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Institute. Perry, a respected scholar and author of the book, \u201cKnow Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities,\u201d noted in an interview with theGrio that public approval of reparations has \u201ctripled\u201d in opinion polls.  A recent survey found that a majority (57 percent) of Americans believe Black people have been affected by the history of slavery in the U.S. Most Americans (63 percent) also said the federal government has a responsibility to do something about it.  Perry and other advocates also pointed out that despite the White House's inaction on creating a reparations commission, states, local municipalities and even the private sector are all engaging in work related to reparations for Black Americans. In addition to California's special task force, Maryland has also created a reparations commission.  In Illinois, Evanston became the through a housing program to fund property repairs and other costs for Black homeowners and homebuyers. Similarly, in Asheville, North Carolina, the city council and issued a formal apology for its involvement in slavery and racially discriminatory policies. The private sector \u2014 including banks, churches, and universities \u2014 has also endorsed reparations or issued some form of reparative measures for Black Americans.  Perry said the growing state and local movement toward reparations is a signal that the rest of the country is already ahead of the federal government, and that \u201cit's better to be in tune with what's happening across the country than \u2026 signaling that reparations is going to bring down a president.\u201d  Dreisen Heath, a researcher at the Human Rights Watch, told theGrio that she sees the reluctance to move on creating a reparations commission as \u201crooted in gatekeeping white supremacy\u201d and not the \u201cshared power of the people.\u201d  \u201cThis should be something that we are all taking as a serious measure for the well-being of our democracy, for the well-being of our country,\u201d said Heath.  She also noted that there's no \u201capology on the books\u201d to Black Americans on behalf of the United States. \u201cWe know,\u201d she added, \u201cthe majority of the federal government's culpability in sanctioning torture and racial subjugation on Black people\u201d  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) speaks at a press conference on Nov. 16, 2021, about H.R. 40 legislation on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. During the press conference, participants called on the legislation to be passed that would create a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for African Americans. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)  Perry said while action on reparations in Washington, D.C. have yet to materialize, it's only a matter of time given the grassroots movements percolating elsewhere. \u201cIf reparations won't come from D.C., it'll go to D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, Biden needs to take this up and treat it like a serious policy issue \u2014 as it is.\u201d  Perry noted that reparations could be implemented in a number of ways, especially when one looks at the myriad forms of reparations already being developed across the country. Regardless, he said, the repair should speak to the harm caused to Black people such as the inability to access and build wealth.  \u201cIt might be, you know, some type of savings bond, it might be cash payment, it might be various land rights,\u201d said Perry. \u201cFor instance, there's a housing gap and one of the ways to close that housing gap is to provide down-payment assistance.\u201d He said reparations could also come in the form of \u201cvarious scholarships for higher education or free college\u201d and eliminating student loan debt.  The movement for reparations is one that dates back decades. Daniels of NAARC is a longtime activist and political scientist. He also worked with the late U.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who introduced the first reparations bill in 1989. Daniels said NAARC's H.R. 40 strategy group has done a lot of the groundwork for the organized call to action for a reparations commission. The organization has been closely working with U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), who in this session of Congress introduced H.R. 40, a bill that builds on Conyers' legislation more than 30 years ago.  Rep. John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) speaks during press conference in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Getty Images)  \u201cShe has been phenomenal in this pushing and scrapping,\u201d said Daniels, stressing that he is \u201chonored\u201d to be able to work alongside Congresswoman Jackson Lee. \u201cI think that's because she sees John Conyers looking down, smiling on her as she has taken the torch from one of the great progressive leaders of our era to push this over the finish line.\u201d  Last Thursday, just days before Juneteenth \u2014 the federal holiday that Biden signed into law last year that commemorates the date (June 19) in 1865 when a Union Army general informed enslaved people in Texas that they were free \u2014 activists held a press conference on the Ellipse in front of the White House. There, they erected a symbolic 150-foot flower and plant installation arranged in the shape of the Pan-African flag. The installation was intended to serve as a reminder to the Biden White House that there is work left to be done for a president who has centered and told Black voters, \u201c .\u201d  Daniels noted that an executive order from Biden would create a budget for a commission and would facilitate hearings to discuss what reparations would look like on the federal level. Ultimately, the commission would send those proposals to Congress.  Reparations, he said, are the \u201coverarching policy prescription that will address the fundamental issue of white supremacy and structural institutional racism in this country.\u201d Referencing the current , Daniels said, \u201c[it] needs to be addressed now in the same way that we're addressing the issues of the assault on democracy.\u201d  He added, \u201cThey go hand-in-hand to some degree because the forces who are trying to destroy democracy are the same forces who are harboring this strong sentiment in terms of white supremacy and structural institutional racism.\u201d  Heath of the Human Rights Watch told theGrio that there can be no racial reckoning in the United States without reparations. \u201cYou cannot reckon with the conditions without repairing them,\u201d she said.  Speaking to Biden and the need for him to unilaterally take up the issue of reparations, Heath said plainly, \u201cThere's really no sides here.\u201d  \u201cThere's right and there's wrong and there's destruction and there's repair \u2026 which one will [he] choose?\u201d  Gerren Keith Gaynor  Gerren Keith Gaynor is the Managing Editor of Politics and Washington Correspondent at theGrio.

Alex Padilla on Sunday said that if Republicans block the voting-rights compromise legislation being drafted by Democratic lawmakers, then the party will have \"no choice\" but to look to filibuster reform.\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC's \"The Mehdi Hasan Show,\" the California Democrat, who last December was tapped to join the upper chamber to fill the remaining term of now-Vice President Kamala Harris, said that if Democrats fail to muster 10 GOP votes to overcome an filibuster, then the party would have to reexamine how to pass the legislation.\nPadilla said that a working group that consists of Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with himself and others, sought to work diligently in order to craft a bill that could garner the support of all 50 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\n\"We've taken some during this August recess to appeal to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle,\" he said. \"I know Sen. Manchin keeps reminding everybody how the preference is always to work in a bipartisan fashion. When we can, that's great. But our fundamental voting rights are so important and so critical.\"\n\n                          \n                          He emphasized: \"I think if we're not successful in getting 10 Republicans to do the right thing, then we have no choice but to revisit the rules of the Senate ... some outdated rules of the Senate. Whether it's abolishing the filibuster as a whole or somehow creating a carve-out or exemption to allow these measures to go forward for the sake of our democracy. It's too important.\"\nFor months, the party's marquee voting-rights measures \u2014 the For the People Act (H.R. 1)\u00a0and the\u00a0John Lewis Voting Advancement Act (H.R. 4) \u2014 have stalled in Congress.\nThe previous version of the For the People Act included provisions to ban partisan gerrymandering, expand early and absentee voting, establish national standards for voter registration, and curb voter purges, among other measures. The bill would also mandate that states offer mail-in ballots and same-day voter registration, policies which are anathema to conservatives.\nThe House passed the previous version of the bill, but it has languished in the Senate \u2014 Democrats need 60 votes to advance the legislation and Republicans have so far refused to sign on to H.R. 1 and filibustered the bill in June. For months, Manchin and Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have dismissed calls to nix the filibuster, saying that such an action would only inflame partisan divisions.\n\n                          \n                          Even if the compromise bill receives 50 votes, Democrats still need 10 crossover votes. Republicans, who have passed of wave of restrictive voting laws across the country, have accused their colleagues across the aisle of seeking to \"federalize\" what they feel are election matters that should be within the purview of states.\nDemocrats contend that the GOP-led voting laws have imperiled the voting rights of everyday Americans, while conservatives argue that the bills are designed to shield the voting process from nefarious activity \u2014 despite the low rates of significant voter fraud.\nSince joining the Senate, Padilla, who previously oversaw California's elections as secretary of state, has called for the elimination of the filibuster.\nWhen asked by Hasan whether he agreed with his Golden State Senate colleague, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said in June that she didn't view democracy as \"being in jeopardy right now,\" Padilla took a different view.\n\n                          \n                          \"Democracy is clearly in jeopardy,\" he said. \"What I can say is that a lot of my colleagues that may have been reticent earlier in the year to modify or abolish the filibuster continue to see the obstruction by not just Mitch McConnell but our Republican colleagues across the board.\"",

And they are on our [Republican] side.\u201d\n\nThe video shows evidence of Scott\u2019s argument, when Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) proclaimed in a shown clip, \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge effort by Republican legislatures throughout the country to suppress the vote.\u201d\n\nThe next clip\u00a0reveals Sen.

Your\u2019e racists plain and simple.\u201d\n\nThe video comes after a poll has indicated \u201cthe American people what fair elections with no fraud,\u201d with\u00a075 percent of Americans supporting voter ID laws that require voters to show photo identification before voting. Sixty percent of Democrats also agree.\n\nAs the U.S. Senate considers legislation that would revamp America\u2019s election laws, voters still overwhelmingly support laws requiring that voters show identification before casting a ballot. Seventy-five percent (75%) of Likely U.S. Voters believe voters should be required to show photo identification such as a driver\u2019s license before being allowed to vote. Only 21% are opposed to such a requirement. Thirty-six states have enacted some form of voter ID law, but those laws would be nullified if the Senate approves H.R. 1, which passed the House on a party-line vote. Critics say H.R. 1 \u201cwould force states to allow anyone to vote who simply signs a form saying that they are who they claim they are.\u201d Support for voter ID laws has actually increased since 2018, when 67% said voters should be required to show photo identification such as a driver\u2019s license before being allowed to vote. Eighty-nine percent (89%) of Republicans support voter ID requirements, as do 60% of Democrats and 77% of voters not affiliated with either major party.\n\nAnother poll also suggests\u00a0Biden voters, Latino citizens, and black Americans overwhelmingly support voter ID laws as follows:\n\nDemocrats are currently forming legislation to trash 35 state voter ID laws.\u00a0H.R. 1, dubbed \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d has passed the House and will move to the Senate.",

States that wisely ban candidates, campaign staffers, party activists and political operatives from handling or delivering absentee ballots would see that ban voided. H.R. 1 would require states to give access to absentee ballots to third-party strangers who may have a stake in the outcome of the election.

    "body": "It's harder to maintain the same optimism, commitment, and focus when it comes to large-scale disability policy and legislation. It seems like Congress should be the ideal place to bring about real, substantial change affecting the whole American disability community. Something is always happening on disability issues in Washington. But it's surprisingly hard for most people with disabilities to keep up with it all, much less maintain a clear set of workable priorities. No list of disability legislation can ever be complete. And the disability community almost never agrees on which issues at any given time are most important, or which bills have the best chance of passing. Still, it can help to at least try drafting a list, or series of lists, of disability bills in Congress. Here are five to start with as we move into the Fall of 2021: Better Care Better Jobs Act (S. 2210 / H. 4131) \u201cTo amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to expand access to home and community-based services (HCBS) under Medicaid, and for other purposes.\u201c Millions of elderly disabled, and disabled people of all ages, need some amount of regular help with ordinary tasks of daily living. Some need occasional help with a few specific tasks they can't do, like shopping, house cleaning, or taking out the garbage. Some need help every day with bathing, grooming, dressing, and cooking. And some need as much as 10 to 24 hours a day of help, or close to it. A lot of people who need basic help like this get it by living in a nursing home or other congregate care. Some choose to do this, but many are there mainly because they can't get the care they need approved and paid for any other way, or because they don't really know any other option. Congregate care is expensive. And keeping it safe, clean, and humane is a constant and almost inherently impossible struggle. Most elder and disabled people, if asked, would prefer to get the help they need to live in their own home, not in a facility . But while home care is a lot more available now than decades ago, the amount and quality of funded home care varies a great deal from state to state. Everywhere it's getting harder to find and properly pay for enough home care staff. And thousands of qualified disabled Americans have been on waiting lists for years to get any services at all. Disabled people, families, and other advocates for home and community based services hope to make an historic dent in this most fundamental problem with a $400 billion federal investment proposed by the Biden Administration. The bill to implement this would: See more details from the Senate Committee on Aging The Better Care Better Jobs Act was originally part of the Biden Administration's infrastructure proposal. But it was moved out of the infrastructure plan during negotiations and is now part of a separate proposed spending package that it is hoped will pass the Senate, most likely with only Democratic votes through \u201creconciliation.\u201d The Senate bill is sponsored by Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), referred to the Senate Finance Committee. The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI), referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Transformation to Competitive Integrated Employment Act (H.R. 2373) \u201cTo assist employers providing employment under special certificates issued under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in transforming their business and program models to models that support individuals with disabilities through competitive integrated employment, to phase out the use of such special certificates, and for other purposes.\u201c Since the 1930s, federal labor law has allowed some employers to pay certain disabled employees less than the Minimum Wage, under what have come to be called \u201c14(c) certificates.\u201d While the practice is gradually fading out, thousands of disabled people are still paid wages that no other worker would tolerate, on the premise that their work is inherently substandard, and that without sub-minimum wage, no other employers would hire them. But other employment models, like \u201c supported employment ,\u201d have shown that most disabled people currently being paid sub-minimum wage and in sheltered settings can work in more mainstream, integrated workplaces, at or above the standard Minimum Wage. This bill is the latest effort to end the practice in a steady but orderly and responsible way. If passed, the \u201cTIME Act\u201d would: See more details from the House Committee on Education and Labor. A House bill is sponsored by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor. Supplemental Security Income Restoration Act (S. 2065 / H.R. 3763) \u201cTo amend title XVI of the Social Security Act to update eligibility for the supplemental security income program, and for other purposes.\u201c Supplemental Security Income benefits, (SSI), which are meant to keep disabled people out of poverty, have been well below poverty level for decades. The maximum asset and earnings rules that determine SSI eligibility and amounts are similarly out of date. This traps disabled people on SSI in poverty, and powerfully discourages people with disabilities SSI on from working and saving to improve their financial stability. The SSI Restoration Act is an ambitious and long overdue attempt to address these longstanding problems. It would: See more details from Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). This bill doesn't address all of the many reforms disability advocates would like to see in both SSI and Social Security Disability. But these are some of the changes most likely to pass in the current political environment and with the present makeup of the House and Senate. The Senate bill is sponsored by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), referred to the Senate Finance Committee. The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) and referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. Disabled Access Credit Expansion Act of 2021 (S. 2481 H.R. 4049) \u201cTo amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the credit for expenditures to provide access to disabled individuals, and for other purposes.\u201c It's hard to significantly increase the rate of employment of people with disabilities. In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act made disability discrimination in hiring, benefits, and promotion illegal. Vocational Rehabilitation in every state can help disabled people prepare for gainful, secure jobs and rewarding careers. The federal government can to some degree mandate quotas for disabled people in federal employment. But these measures haven't significantly moved the needle on the big-picture rate of employment for working-age disabled people, which in 2020 was just short of 18 percent . What else is there to do that's within the power of Congress? There are actually two bills addressing part of this problem in similar ways. The Disabled Access Credit Expansion Act would: See more details from Rep. Jim Langevin (D-RI) The Senate bill is sponsored by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), referred to the Senate Finance Committee. The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Donald McEachin (D-VA), referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, along with several other relevant committees. A similar bill along these lines is also under consideration: Disability Employment Incentive Act (S. 630 / H.R. 3765) \u201cTo amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include individuals receiving Social Security Disability Insurance benefits under the work opportunity credit, increase the work opportunity credit for vocational rehabilitation referrals, qualified SSI recipients, and qualified SSDI recipients, expand the disabled access credit, and enhance the deduction for expenditures to remove architectural and transportation barriers to the handicapped and elderly.\u201d The Disability Employment Incentive Act would: The Senate bill is sponsored by Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), referred to the Senate Finance Committee. The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Josh Harder (D-CA) and referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. See more details from Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) The prospects for these bills vary, and their likely timelines are probably vastly different as well. Some could pass this year, while others may be only beginning a negotiation process that will take years. Whether or not you agree with everything in these bills, every member of Congress should hear about them from their disabled constituents, and from their families, friends, and allies.

Democrats claim the matching system would be paid for by a surcharge on corporations and the wealthy.\nAnd it reaffirms Congress'\u00a0authority to regulate money in politics, pushing back on the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizen United decision.\u00a0In a swipe at former President Donald Trump, it also requires presidents to disclose their tax returns \u2013\u00a0something Trump did not do\u00a0while in office.\nMeanwhile, backers of the bill say it seeks to \"fortify ethics law\" by breaking the \"influence economy in Washington\" and increases accountability by expanding conflict-of-interest laws and divestment requirements in an effort to slow the \"revolving door\" and prevent members of Congress from serving on corporate boards.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., previously pushed the bill in the last Congress.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAll\u00a0House Democrats\u00a0last week\u00a0signed onto the bill, which\u00a0is expected to be considered on the House floor this week.\nRepublican opposition was also fierce during the last session, when House Democrats first introduced the legislation.

During the March 24 hearing on the bill, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,\u00a0and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0launched heated broadsides against each other.\u00a0\nSCHUMER, MCCONNELL SPAR OVER DEMS' S1 ELECTION BILL DURING RARE COMMITTEE APPEARANCE: 'SHAME!'\n\"Shame, shame, shame,\" Schumer\u00a0said while referring to GOP efforts to tighten voting rules on the state level after Democrats won the 2020 election.\n\n      Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praises his Democratic Caucus at a news conference just after the Senate narrowly approved a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Saturday, March 6, 2021. Schumer has voted the Senate will take up S.1, the Democrats' sweeping election reform legislation. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n      \n\n\n\"Instead of doing what you should be doing when you lose an election in a democracy, attempting to win over those voters in the next election, Republicans instead are trying to disenfranchise those voters,\" Schumer said. \"Shame on them.\"\nMcConnell, however, said Democrats were trying to \"forcibly rewrite\" election laws in all 50 states and turn the Federal Election Commission into a partisan body to enforce campaign laws.\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS PASS EXTENSIVE VOTING AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL, H.R. 1\n\"Talk\u00a0about shame. If anybody ought to be feeling any shame around here, it's turning the FEC into a partisan prosecutor, the majority controlled by the president's party, to harass and intimidate the other side,\" McConnell said during the March 24 hearing. \"That's what you ought to be ashamed about.\"\nThe backdrop for the legislation is the fate of the Senate's legislative filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. With the Senate split 50-50, Democrats would have to win over 10 Republicans to pass the bill, which seems impossible given the\u00a0fierce GOP opposition.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo progressives argue that voting\u00a0rights legislation should be the landmark bill to abolish the filibuster and pass the legislation\u00a0with a simple majority. Schumer has vowed to bring S.1 up for a vote and signaled this legislation may change the rules.\u00a0\n\"The process that I outlined for S.1 is a process that, I think, could very well cause the Senate to evolve,\"\u00a0Schumer told\u00a0The New York Times'\u00a0Ezra Klein in April in reference to the filibuster.\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS' H.R. 1 WOULD CREATE NEW PUBLIC FINANCING OF CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGNS\nThe House already passed its version of\u00a0H.R. 1 in March in a party-line vote.\u00a0The legislation sets up a\u00a0new public financing system\u00a0for congressional and presidential elections to incentivize small-dollar\u00a0donations. The legislation would establish a\u00a06-to-1\u00a0match for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200.\u00a0\nThe elections bill\u00a0would also\u00a0enact automatic voter registration, restore\u00a0voting rights to felons after they have completed their sentences, mandate\u00a0same-day voter registration and require\u00a0states to send\u00a0absentee ballots at least 45 days before an election.\u00a0The legislation weakens state-mandated voter ID requirements by allowing those without photo identification to still vote by signing sworn affidavits.\n\n      In this Oct. 12, 2020, file photo, people wait in line for early voting at the Bell Auditorium in Augusta, Ga. (Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle via AP, File)\n      (Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle via AP, File)\n\n\nIt also prohibits voter roll purges and\u00a0partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, imposes new campaign finance rules and\u00a0requires presidential nominees to release 10 years of tax returns.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nRepublicans said the new federal rules would force all state and local election officials to change their voting procedures to fit Democrats' demands and create more distrust in doing so.\n\"This bill would require all of these changes to be made very quickly \u2014 so quickly that should this legislation be enacted, chaos will reign in the next election and voters will have even less faith in the integrity of their elections than they currently do,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.\nDemocrats are motivated by GOP-led voting changes in places like\u00a0Georgia and Florida in the wake of the 2020 election when Democrats won the House, Senate and White House.\u00a0Democrats view the new rules as suppression efforts to make it harder to vote, while Republicans say the updated laws are needed to ensure election integrity.\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the Rules Committee, authored a revised version of the bill she'll put forth\u00a0Tuesday as a substitute amendment that is expected to give states more flexibility in enacting the requirements of the federal voting rights bill.\nKlobuchar, D-Minn., said in March\u00a0the legislation is needed to combat threats to\u00a0democracy.\n\"At a time when the right to vote is under attack and special interests and dark money are drowning out the voices of the American people, we need to take action,\" she said.",

    "body": "President Joe Biden signed an executive order Sunday calling on federal agencies to expand voting access as part of his administration's efforts \"to promote and defend the right to vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in elections.\"\n\n\"It is the responsibility of the federal government to expand access to, and education about, voter registration and election information, and to combat misinformation, in order to enable all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy,\" the order read.\n\nBiden announced the order in virtual remarks played before the Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast in Selma, Alabama, which commemorates the 1965 \"Bloody Sunday\" crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where police beat Black demonstrators fighting for access to the ballot box along their march.\n\nThe House on Friday passed H.R. 1, a wide-ranging package of electoral and ethics reforms that Biden said he would sign into law should it make it through the Senate. Republican legislatures across the country are seeking to enact more restrictive voting measures after former President Donald Trump's defeat in November.\n\nIn his remarks Sunday, Biden said the Republican efforts were \"an all-out assault on the right to vote.\"\n\n\"During the current legislative session, elected officials in 43 states have already introduced more than 250 bills to make it harder for Americans to vote,\" he said. \"We cannot let them succeed.\"\n\nBiden said H.R. 1 was \"a landmark piece of legislation that is urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy.\"\n\n\"I hope the Senate does its work so that I can sign it into law,\" he said. \"I also urge Congress to fully restore the Voting Rights Act, named in John Lewis' honor.\n\n\"Let the people vote,\" he added.\n\nBiden's order calls on federal agencies to \"consider ways to expand citizens' opportunities to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process,\" make it easier for federal employees to vote by recommending how to \"expand the federal government's policy of granting employees time off to vote\" and increase access to the ballot for voters with disabilities, Native Americans, active-duty military service members, overseas Americans and eligible federal prisoners.\n\nH.R. 1 remains Democrats' best hope to secure increased voter protections, however. As an official said, the Biden administration does not have the jurisdiction to override restrictive voting measures enacted at the state level.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nProgressive Democrats are stewing after one of their top priorities, a massive elections bill, stalled in the Senate Tuesday \u2013 and they're directing their ire at several targets, including Republicans, the Senate filibuster and even President Biden, who they allege didn't do enough to stump for the legislation.\u00a0\n\"He's not absent, but he needs to be a lot more vocal and a lot more out front. The president supports H.R.1, the American people support H.R. 1 overwhelmingly. The president needs to lead out front and be very vocal on this issue.\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., told CNN Tuesday of the president's involvement on election reform.\u00a0\nDemocrats' sweeping proposal is titled the For the People Act and has been given the bill number H.R.1 in the House and S.1 in the Senate. Bowman's comments came before the cloture vote Tuesday evening that officially blocked the bill in the Senate but after it was clear all 50 Senate Republicans would oppose it.\u00a0\nBowman, one of the newly elected members of the left-wing \"Squad,\" said both Biden and Vice President Harris are former senators who should be leveraging their relationships in the chamber to push S.1, as he claimed they did on a bill to make Juneteenth an official holiday.\u00a0\nREPUBLICANS BLOCK \u2018ROTTEN\u2019 ELECTION REFORM BILL IN SENATE AS VP HARRIS PRESIDES OVER DEBATE\n\"The same conversations need to happen when it comes to S.1,\" Bowman told CNN. \"The same relationships need to be used that the president has built over the course of his career to make sure we pass S.1.\"\nRep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said it's not clear to him the president is serious about voting reform. Biden \"just sort of stared at me,\" Jones told the Associated Press about an interaction between the two men after Jones told Biden he needed to be bolder in lobbying for S.1.\u00a0\n\"President Obama, for his part, has been doing more to salvage our ailing democracy than the current president of the United States of America,\" Jones said.\u00a0\nThe White House has pushed back against the criticism. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden is \"passionate\" about voting legislation and is \"absolutely revolted\" by election security bills being passed by Republican state legislatures. As evidence, she cited an executive order signed by the president, a speech he gave in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on the anniversary of the 1921 race massacre there, and recent enforcement actions taken by the Justice Department on voting laws.\u00a0\n \n      White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a briefing at the White House, Monday, May 17, 2021, in Washington. Psaki defended President Biden against allegations from progressives that he hasn't done enough to push voting reforms. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n      \n\n\nAnd Biden himself excoriated Republicans in a Tuesday night statement after they unanimously filibustered S.1, which they characterize as a massive federal power grab over state election authority that's designed to help keep Democrats in power.\u00a0\nDemocrats, Biden said, \"stood against the ongoing assault of voter suppression that represents a Jim Crow era in the 21st century.\"\nSANDERS, WARREN RESPOND TO SINEMA'S FILIBUSTER DEFENSE, SAY SENATE \u2018HAS GOT TO ACT\u2019 DESPITE RULE\nBut the president is hardly the only contributing factor to S.1's defeat that the left is lamenting. Among them is the filibuster itself, which left-leaning Democrats have been agitating to get rid of.\u00a0\n\"If there is no Republican support to protect the rights of people of color, young people, people with disabilities to cast a ballot, the United States Senate has got to act and if it takes 50 votes and the vice president, that's what it takes,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in response to a question from Fox News about the filibuster Tuesday.\u00a0\n \n      Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., arrives before President Joe Biden addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber of the U.S. Capitol April 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. Sanders told Fox News that Democrats \"have got to act\" and if that means ending the filibuster, \"that's what it takes.\" \u00a0(Photo by Melina Mara-Pool/Getty Images)\n      \n\n\n\"We've got to find a way to pass voting rights and I'm deeply committed to that,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., also said. \"No Senate rule is more important than the constitutional right to vote.\"\n\"Call me radical, but I do not believe a minority of Senators should be able to block voting rights for millions of people,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said.\u00a0\n\"The people did not give Democrats the House, Senate and White House to compromise with insurrectionists,\" Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said. \"Abolish the filibuster so we can do the people's work.\"\n\"Our democracy is more important than the Senate filibuster,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted.\nOthers, meanwhile, also directed their fire at the Republicans who used the filibuster.\n\"Mitch McConnell and the desperate Republican minority just silenced the American people, sold out our elections to their billionaire donors, and defended corruption that is rotting government to its core,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, said.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who has shifted to the left in recent years, did not mention the filibuster but he equated Republicans with racist senators during the civil rights era.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Every single Senate Republican just voted against starting debate \u2013 starting debate \u2013 on legislation to protect Americans\u2019 voting rights,\" Schumer said. \"The Republican leader uses the language and the logic of the Southern Senators of the 1960s who defended states\u2019 rights, and it is an indefensible position for any senator \u2013 any senator, let alone the minority leader \u2013 to hold\u2026 That is both ridiculous and awful.\"\nIt's not clear what Democrats' next step will be amid united GOP opposition to changing election rules. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said he hopes public pressure can change some minds.\u00a0\n\"I like to believe that there's always a way to make sure that the public will gets accomplished,\" he told Fox News.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "body": "On Tuesday, July 5 th, Colorado became the second state in the U.S. \u2013 the other is Illinois - to sign into law legislation that implements a cap on the out-of-pocket costs of insulin for all diabetics. Since May of this year, six other states - Maine, New Mexico, New York, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia - have passed laws that cap most, but not all, diabetic patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs of insulin at $100 per month.In Colorado, under the new law, every diabetic, including those who are uninsured, will pay no more than $100 for a month\u2019s supply of insulin. The bill also establishes a program that allows patients one emergency 30-day supply of insulin each year for $35, and to join a program providing insulin for a full year for $50 per month. The law will take effect January 1, 2022.As list prices of insulin have risen steadily during the past decade, insulin affordability has become a hot button issue. While the net costs of insulin \u2013 after rebates - to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), health plans, and employers have actually been decreasing in recent years, patient out-of-pocket costs have increased. This is because patient co-insurance is calculated as a percentage of the ever-increasing list prices. The rebates extracted from drug manufacturers by PBMs are not passed through to patients at the pharmacy counter. A study by the Colorado attorney general found 40% of diabetics in the state are rationing their insulin due to its high out-of-pocket cost burden.PROMOTEDThe federal government has made a number of attempts to address the problem of insulin affordability. In Congress, for example, H.R. 5749 - Affordable Insulin for All Act - would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to enter into agreements with insulin manufacturers to enable diabetics to access Medicaid prices for insulin. Additionally, H.R. 5749 includes provisions that would require Medicare and commercial plans to limit cost-sharing to a maximum of $10 per month for insulin products. Furthermore, the bill would eliminate a safe harbor for rebates for insulin products. This would effectively force a 100% pass-through of rebates to patients rather than permitting a portion of the rebates to be retained by PBMs as profit. But, H.R. 5749 is at the stage where it\u2019s only been referred to a House subcommittee on health. This occurred in early 2020. There has since been no update in the bill\u2019s status.Under the Trump Administration, the executive branch sought to reduce out-of-pocket costs for certain diabetic patients. In May of 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced an initiative in which certain Medicare Part D prescription drug plans with an enhanced benefit will provide Medicare beneficiaries access to a broad set of insulin products at a maximum $35 co-payment for a month\u2019s supply. In 2021, approximately one third of Part D plans offer such a benefit.Also, last July, the Trump Administration issued an executive order that requires federally qualified community health centers - clinics that deliver care to low-income patients - to pass through 340B program discounts for insulin to diabetics and epinephrine auto-injectors for severe allergy sufferers.In January 2021, however, the Biden Administration suspended the executive order pending further review. And in June, the Department of HHS rescinded the executive order. HHS claims there would be \u201cundue administrative costs\u201d should the order be implemented.In lieu of federal government action, there have been several market-driven initiatives aimed at lowering the cost burden for diabetics, such as Walmart launching its own inexpensive brand of insulin for sale. While such initiatives can help some patients, they\u2019re not systematic in nature. That is, they don\u2019t serve the entire diabetic population.States like Colorado are doing what they can to systematically address the persistent problem of insulin affordability. It\u2019s very likely more states will follow the example set by the eight states that have instituted caps on out-of-pocket costs for most or all diabetic patients.",

JIPA is being reintroduced as\u00a0H.R. 1280 (JIPA); both versions of the House legislation were sponsored by Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA).\n\nAs Scott observed, the bills overlapped on many issues.\n\n\u201cThe actual problem is not what is being offered; it is who is offering it,\u201d a visibly frustrated Scott told the Senate last year.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 effort to impose a policy rather than pass a bipartisan bill repeats a pattern seen in 2012, when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced a bill to help \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 illegal aliens brought to the country as minors \u2014 only to watch as President Barack Obama introduced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), going around Congress.\n\n \u201cI hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will come to the table to find common ground where we can make meaningful changes that will bring us closer to the goal of a more just country,\u201d Scott said Tuesday.\n\nJoel B.

This guy is responsible for the blood of young men and women [being spilled].\u201d\n\nMandel remarked on Biden\u2019s cognition and physicality. He assessed the Biden family\u2019s stated support for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign was negligent given the president\u2019s mental and physical states.\n\n\u201cI believe that Joe Biden is not all there, mentally and physically. He\u2019s not the man he once was. I believe he\u2019s mentally and physically unfit for office. Frankly, I blame a lot of it on his family and his advisers, to a certain extent. It\u2019s like elder abuse that they even allowed him to run, and now he is serving in the position of commander-in-chief of our military, but he doesn\u2019t have the mental and physical capability to do so,\u00a0and the result is American blood spilled in the streets of Kabul,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enraging to me, as a marine, as a guy who did my small part, to watch these marines and a Navy corpsman get blown to shreds when it was all avoidable,\u201d he remarked.\n\n\u201cThis is a failure at a colossal level, orders of magnitude beyond anything we\u2019ve ever seen. They call this Saigon Two. This is a lot worse than than what happened in Saigon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior military leaders must be removed from their positions,\u201d he said.\n\nMandel recalled a report from the New York Post alleging that the Taliban is using biometric data and technology to hunt and kill Afghans who assisted the U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan. Breitbart News reported that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with a list of names of American citizens, green card holders, and Afghan allies in the region.\n\n\u201cThose [biometric] systems and that data is now in the hands of the Taliban. \u2026 They are now using it as a kill list to hunt down Americans and hunt down Afghans that were friendly,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nMandel described election integrity as a political priority at the national level. He said Democrats\u2019 For the People Act \u2014 H.R. 1 and S. 1 in the House and Senate, respectively \u2014 are part of a broader campaign\u00a0to undermine the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI do not believe we want the federal government to make any election laws. That\u2019s what the Democrats are trying to do with H.R. 1. And S. 1. Those efforts need to be crushed, because those efforts would advance the cause of the Democrats stealing more and more elections,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal government should investigate the 2020 presidential election with audits of votes, Mandel held. \u201cDemocrats argue, \u2018Oh, well you know this was all litigated already.\u2019 That\u2019s baloney. It wasn\u2019t. Sixty-one out of the 63 cases were dismissed on procedural grounds, not on the merits.\u00a0It\u2019s never been investigated on the merits, and it needs to be investigated with the full power of the federal government.\u201d\n\nMandel framed Democrats\u2019 legislative attempts to diminish election security as indignities to the memories of fallen U.S. military personnel.\n\n\u201cEvery time the Democrats cheat in elections, they\u2019re not only disenfranchising their neighbors, they\u2019re stomping on the graves of every young man and every young woman who\u2019s paid the ultimate sacrifice so that we can live free and that we can vote every November,\u201d he determined.\n\nMandel is the former state treasurer of Ohio and a former Republican member of the Ohio House of Representatives. He is military veteran of the Iraq War and retired from the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.",

The House Democrat plan, H.R. 3, would effectively discourage and even penalize these companies that are pushing the boundaries of science and research to deliver life-changing treatments for patients.\u201cWe are particularly concerned that the bill\u2019s sweeping government price-setting measures, including international price indexing, would impede innovation and have a chilling effect on investment in drug discovery - hitting our emerging biotech and biopharma companies particularly hard. It\u2019s estimated that H.R. 3 could have a trillion-dollar impact on the drug industry over ten years. The Congressional Budget Office says it would result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.\u201cWe urge Congress to examine other more effective and market-oriented solutions that directly lower patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs and put access and patient care first.\u201dAbout BioUtahBioUtah is an independent 501(c)(6) trade association serving Utah\u2019s life sciences industry. Its member companies reflect a broad spectrum of the industry with strengths in medical device manufacturing and services, research and testing, biotechnology, biopharmaceuticals, and advanced diagnostics, and healthIT, amongst others; and are a key driver of Utah\u2019s economy. driven by BioUtah, is an industry initiative, in collaboration with key public partners, to showcase the crucial innovations and contributions of the industry collective that boosts our state\u2019s economy and helps patients worldwide.View source version on businesswire.com:SOURCE: BioUtahDenise BellBioUtah202-680-3030COMTEX_384921049/2456/2021-04-22T22:01:12Is there a problem with this press release?

    "body": "Theater people and academics share two traits: They are convinced of their calling's moral importance to the world, which can provide a feeling of superiority, but they also often feel misunderstood and beleaguered, which makes them defensive. As members of a university's theater department, the characters in Hillary Miller 's new comedy \u201cPreparedness\u201d \u2014 presented by the Bushwick Starr and HERE \u2014 belong to both constituencies, which means that their shoulders slump under boulder-size chips.  That wariness is warranted, though, as their department is under attack from the university's brass, which wants not just to cut their budget, but eliminate the program altogether.  Figurative and literal survival become entangled when an irrepressibly chirpy H.R. representative, Kath (Alison Cimmet), turns up in the department's shabby \u2014 and decidedly not chic \u2014 conference-slash-break room. If the teachers undergo state-mandated training on how to handle a potential mass shooting, they will have a better chance of surviving both a gunman and the dean's delete button.  An assistant professor in the English department at Queens College and the author of books on theater, Miller is fluent in academia's quirks and jargon, as well as interdepartmental rivalries \u2014 don't get the theater professors started on their brethren in film and digital tech. She also nails bureaucracies' love for acronyms, deployed here in a dizzying alphabet soup that includes MeRP (Mutual Respect Pledge), ACOST (Active Campus Operations Shooter Training) and GOHOHOF (Get Out, Hide Out, Help Out, Fight), as well as references to \u201cFERPP requests\u201d and \u201cFULAP forms.\u201d  Miller and the director Kristjan Thor neatly sketch certain types that turn up in pretty much every group of educators. Most memorable are the beleaguered chairman, Jeff (Lou Liberatore), doing his darnedest to save his department, and Laurette (the wonderful Nora Cole, master of the haughty side eye), a grande dame prone to statement shawls and imbued with the authority that comes from charisma, experience and lofty ideals about her vocation. \u201cWe're theater artists,\u201d she says. \u201cWe create sacred spaces for a living!\u201d  Just as familiar is the high-strung, humorless Hayd\u00e9e Garc\u00eda-Shelton (Tracy Hazas), who seems to have a hard time gelling with her colleagues \u2014 she casually informs them that she got married over the weekend, as if it were no big deal \u2014 and shows disdain for musicals and their fans. \u201cIf you ask these people about my work, they'll pretend to care, and then they'll go right back to pushing their GoFundMe for bouffant wigs,\u201d she says. One guess as to who will eventually use pepper spray.  Getting this motley bunch to agree on anything, especially an administrative injunction perceived as an imposition, is akin to herding cats \u2014 real ones, unlike Cat Blanchett, the department's new robotic \u201cResilience Mascot,\u201d a gesture meant to help improve the sinking morale.  Ultimately, though, Miller can't resolve a central issue: Some of the professors' refusal to undergo training is mystifying. It's easy to understand resistance to H.R., but a quick training session that both covers a very real concern \u2014 mass shootings in schools \u2014 and saves your funding feels like a gimme. And yet they bicker.  Having painted herself into a corner, Miller can't figure out how to end the play. So she gives Laurette, who is retiring, the last word in the form of an address to her students. It is a good speech, and a dodge.

Nineteen beautiful, innocent children and two dedicated, brave teachers are gone forever because of a vicious massacre,\u201d Hurd wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times . \u201cIt's infuriating. It's heartbreaking. It was preventable.\u201d  In the wake of the massacre at Robb Elementary School, and another mass shooting in Buffalo, New York that left 10 dead last month, a bipartisan group of senators are working on a gun control bill. But GOP lawmakers have argued that no new laws would prevent people from committing gun violence and blamed the shootings on an array of other factors . Many were criticized for offering \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d instead of meaningful solutions.  \u201cI believe in the plain language of the Second Amendment. In Congress I had an A rating with the National Rifle Association, and they supported my re-election campaigns,\u201d Hurd noted. \u201cI also believe it's ridiculous that any attempt to reform laws to keep lethal firearms out of irresponsible hands is met with outrage and stonewalling.\u201d  Hurd called for a multifaceted approach to America's gun violence issue, including stronger social safety nets in communities and accessible, quality mental health care facilities.  \u201cBut we also must be prepared if our attempts are unsuccessful \u2014 and that means preventing potential mass shooters from getting access to weapons and victims,\u201d he wrote.  Hurd was one of eight Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of H.R. 8, a bill passed by the House last year that would've required universal background checks for gun purchases.  Bills like H.R. 8 should be signed into law, Hurd said, and the age to purchase a high-caliber semiautomatic weapon should be raised. Red flag laws that allow law enforcement to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals who may pose a danger to themselves or others should also be built at a federal level, he said.  \u201cMass shootings don't have to be a fact of life. They are preventable. However, we can't retreat to our political corners and repeat the same tired talking points,\u201d Hurd stated.  Popular in the Community",

(RELATED: \u2018Does The Devil Use Microsoft Word Or Google Docs?\u2019: CNN Hosts Mock Republican Criticism That H.R. 1 Was \u2018Written In Hell\u2019)\n      Reid began by playing a clip of Democratic Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock speaking in the Senate on the need to pass the For the People Act, or H.R. 1, with or without the filibuster. She then played a video clip of Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said he\u2019d filibuster to block H.R. 1., before introducing Psaki to respond.\n \u201cI think that anyone who wants to make it harder to vote, make it less accessible, make it more difficult, and less likely for more people to vote, maybe should take a close look at whether they have bad ideas and people just don\u2019t want to support them,\u201d Psaki replied.\n \u201cIt should be easier. We should want more people to vote. We should, of course, pass laws to make it easier to vote. We should work with states to make it easier to vote.

Those proposals, which would require photo IDs to vote and a sufficient reason to vote by absentee ballot, have received widespread criticism from Democrats and other activist groups.",

    "body": "Twenty attorneys general signed a letter addressed to House and Senate leaders pleading against H.R. 1, which the Democrat-led House passed on party lines late Wednesday evening, deeming it unconstitutional as it sets what they described as \u201calarming mandates,\u201d leading to the federalization of state elections.\n\nThe House passed H.R. 1, of the \u201cFor the People Act of 2021,\u201d Wednesday night, earning praise from Democrats across the board. Hours prior to its passage, 20 attorneys general, led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R), sent a letter addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). H.R. 1 \u201cbetrays several Constitutional deficiencies and alarming mandates that, if passed, would federalize state elections and impose burdensome costs and regulations on state and local officials,\u201d they wrote, detailing the Elections Clause of Article I of the Constitution and the Electors Clause of Article II, which gives states the primary role in conducting federal elections for House and Senate, and an even bigger role in presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThe Act would invert that constitutional structure, commandeer state resources, confuse and muddle elections procedures, and erode faith in our elections and systems of governance,\u201d the attorneys general wrote, asking lawmakers to consider the measure\u2019s many \u201cvulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nH.R. 1, they continued, \u201cimplicates the Electors Clause\u201d by regulating the elections for president and vice president. The state leaders also highlighted the \u201csevere constitutional hurdles\u201d the measure faces due to its \u201cregulation of congressional elections, including by mandating mail-in voting, requiring states to accept late ballots, overriding state voter identification (\u201cID\u201d) laws, and mandating that states conduct redistricting through unelected commissions.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys general identified the measure\u2019s limitations on voter ID laws as, perhaps, the most \u201cegregious\u201d portion of the act, noting that a majority of states have some form of a voter ID law:\n\nYet the Act would dismantle meaningful voter ID laws by allowing a statement, as a substitute for prior-issued, document-backed identification, to \u201cattest[] to the individual\u2019s identity and . . . that the individual is eligible to vote in the election.\u201d This does little to ensure that voters are who they say they are. Worse, it vitiates the capacity of voter ID requirements to protect against improper interference with voting rights. Before the advent of voter ID laws, partisans stationed at polling places could challenge voters based only on suspicions about identity, a process that prompted concerns about voter intimidation. Robust voter ID laws, however, require all voters to present photo identification, i.e., objective, on-the-spot confirmation of the right to vote that immediately refutes bad-faith challenges based on vaguely articulated suspicions. Fair election laws treat all voters equally. By that standard, the Act is not a fair election law.\n\nThe state leaders also highlighted the potential issues with nationwide automatic voter registration, limitations on how states manage their voter rolls, and the call for states to \u201cundertake congressional redistricting by way of so-called \u2018independent\u2019 commissions.\u201d\n\nOverall, the act \u201ctakes a one-sided approach to governing and usurps states\u2019 authority over elections,\u201d the letter read:\n\nWith confidence in elections at a record low, the country\u2019s focus should be on building trust in the electoral process. Around the nation, the 2020 general elections generated mass confusion and distrust\u2014problems that the Act would only exacerbate. Should the Act become law, we will seek legal remedies to protect the Constitution, the sovereignty of all states, our elections, and the rights of our citizens.\n\nSigners include the attorney general from several states, including Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.",

    "body": "The measures include curtailing eligibility to vote by mail, prohibiting the use of ballot drop boxes, and in the case of Georgia \u2014 where the GOP lost two Senate seats and which voted for a Democratic president for the first time since Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 win \u2014 blocking early voting on Sundays.\n\nThat particular measure has been called a flagrant and obvious attempt to disenfranchise Black voters in the state. The chairman of Georgia\u2019s new House Special Committee on Election Integrity, state Rep. Barry Fleming (R), said his committee\u2019s mission is to \u201crestore the confidence of our public in our elections system,\u201d an allusion to the false claims spread by former president Donald Trump about voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nGOP officials in Arizona, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 all states that could have an impact on future presidential elections \u2014 are also considering legislation that would restrict voting.\n\nThat\u2019s why Democrats are moving forward with their bill at the national level, and while it might not pass in the Senate, they want to put pressure on Republicans, who have called it a political power grab.\n\n\u201cIt is not designed to protect Americans\u2019 vote \u2014 it is designed to put a thumb on the scale in every election in America, so that Democrats can turn a temporary majority into permanent control,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Tuesday.\n\nHere\u2019s what the bill actually contains:\n\nA set of national voter registration and mail-in voting standards: H.R. 1 requires the chief election official in each state \u2014 the secretary of state in most \u2014 to establish an automatic voter-registration system that gathers individuals\u2019 information from government databases and registers them unless they intentionally opt out.\n\nAnd it says it\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to keep that information up-to-date, based on information from agencies like state motor vehicle administrations, agencies that receive money from Social Security or the Affordable Care Act, the justice system, and federal agencies including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Social Security Administration and others.\n\nThe law would also guarantee voters same-day registration either at early voting sites or at precincts on Election Day. Each state would be required to allow at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections, for at least 10 hours a day with at least some time before 9 a.m. and after 5 p.m. The law would limit how states can purge voter rolls.\n\nNonpartisan redistricting commissions: In an attempt to get rid of gerrymandering, the law would require each state to use independent commissions (not made up of lawmakers) to approve newly drawn congressional districts. The commissions would each include five Democrats, five Republicans and five independents, requiring bipartisan approval for districts to be allowed.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s a red state or a blue state, we are seeing significant manipulation in the legislative redrawing of districts,\u201d said Tom Lopach, CEO of the nonpartisan Voter Participation Center, which has advocated for the bill. \u201cH.R. 1 presents an opportunity for everyone to get onboard with independent, unbiased and balanced redistricting that frankly is good government.\u201d\n\nIt would also give the public a whole new level of scrutiny, and a chance to object to badly drawn districts. The law would require a public comment period and give citizens a legal basis to challenge gerrymandering. (Currently, gerrymandering challenges have to be made on constitutional grounds, and if a law were passed, there would be a clearer argument to present in court against gerrymandered districts.)\n\nBig changes in campaign finance law: H.R. 1 would require super PACs and \u201cdark money\u201d groups to disclose their donors publicly, a step Democrats say would eliminate one of the most opaque parts of the U.S. election process. It would establish a public funding match for small-dollar donations, financed by a fee on corporations and banks paying civil or criminal penalties.\n\nIt would also require Facebook and Twitter to publicly report the source and amount of money spent on political ads.\n\nNew ethics rules for public servants: The bill would create the first ethics code for Supreme Court justices, to be created within a year of the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nIt would also stop a controversial practice in Congress: When a member of Congress settles a sexual harassment or discrimination lawsuit, in certain cases they can use taxpayer money to settle. H.R. 1 would prevent taxpayer money from being used for such settlements.\n\nThe bill would also create more oversight on lobbyists and foreign agents.\n\nA requirement that presidential candidates disclose their tax returns: This one is a little more relevant to recent events. Democrats have been frustrated for years that Trump never released his tax returns, and H.R. 1 would require it by law.\n\nCan it pass in the Senate?\n\nSenate Democrats plan to move the bill forward, but Republicans in the chamber have been very public with their pledge to fight it forcefully. A similar House bill was passed in 2019, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nCurrent Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has promised to end what he called McConnell\u2019s \u201clegislative graveyard,\u201d and bring more bills passed by the House to the floor to force votes. But if they actually want it to pass, Democrats don\u2019t have a lot of options.\n\nUnlike the coronavirus relief package making its way through the Senate, for which Schumer only needs 50 votes plus Vice President Harris\u2019s tiebreaker, H.R. 1 isn\u2019t being passed through the special reconciliation process that requires a simple majority.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 other option is to eliminate part or all of the legislative filibuster \u2014 a political bombshell that would allow them to pass much more legislation with just 50 votes and Harris\u2019s tiebreaker.\n\nEven if they do pass it, it would probably come up against lawsuits. The conservative Heritage Foundation has called many of the bill\u2019s provisions unconstitutional, and given how opposed congressional Republicans are to it, legal challenges seem inevitable.",

    "body": "Senate minority leader joins 'Special Report' to assess Biden's presidency and lay out GOP's strategy to regain majority\n\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Sen. Mike Braun are rolling out a measure Thursday that would prevent Democrats from \"weaponizing\" the Internal Revenue Service to target conservatives, by codifying a Trump-era rule that would protect groups regardless of their political ideology, and prevent the IRS from doxing donors, Fox News has learned.\u00a0\nFox News exclusively obtained the legislation on Wednesday, titled the \"Don\u2019t Weaponize the IRS Act,\" which would ensure that certain tax-exempt groups are no longer required to provide the names and addresses of major donors on annual returns filed with the IRS.\u00a0\nHR1'S SWEEPING CHANGES AND DEADLINES COULD SOW 'CONFUSION, CHAOS, FRAUD, AND LITIGATION,\u2019 REPORT SAYS\nThe bill would, though, require the tax-exempt groups to report to the IRS the amounts of donations from their substantial donors, while maintaining the names and addresses of those donors for their own records.\u00a0\nSources familiar with the legislation said the removal of the requirement to report the names and addresses of donors would help protect taxpayers\u2019 First Amendment rights, while noting that such information is not needed for tax administration purposes.\u00a0\n\"The IRS is not a campaign finance enforcement agency,\" a source familiar with the legislation told Fox News.\u00a0\nThe legislation was drafted due to provisions under H.R. 1, which would permit the IRS to investigate and consider the political and policy positions of nonprofit organizations before granting tax-exempt status, which Republicans argue would enable IRS officials to target organizations engaging in First Amendment activity with \"disfavored views.\"\u00a0\n\"We saw during the Obama years that the IRS was used as a political weapon to target conservative nonprofits, and under H.R.1 the Biden IRS would be empowered to block tax-exempt status and publicly expose a group\u2019s donors to harassment from liberal groups and the media if their beliefs are deemed to be politically unfavorable,\" Braun, R-Ind., told Fox News.\u00a0\n\"This bill will prevent the IRS from being weaponized against conservatives like it was under President Obama,\" Braun added.\u00a0\nUnder H.R.1, For the People Act of 2021, Democrats\u2019 sweeping election reform legislation, Section 4501 states the \"Repeal of restriction of use of funds by Internal Revenue Service to bring transparency to political activity of certain nonprofit organizations.\"\u00a0\nThe restriction was a final rule promoted by the Trump administration in May 2020, which did not require tax-exempt 501 ( c ) (3) and political organizations to report the names and addresses of substantial contributes to the IRS on annual information returns.\u00a0\nAnd in April, Senate Democrats penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, urging the agencies to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s decision to \"eliminate disclosure requirements for certain tax-exempt organizations that engage in political activity.\"\u00a0\n20 STATE AGS DENOUNCE DEMOCRATS' HR1 AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\"As it stands, this policy weakens federal tax laws, campaign finance laws, and longstanding efforts to prevent foreign interference in U.S. elections,\" more than three dozen Senate Democrats wrote, urging the agencies to \"reinstate the requirement that certain tax-exempt organizations engaged in political activity disclose information about their major donors to the IRS.\"\u00a0\nMeanwhile, McConnell and Braun\u2019s bill is related related to the Obama-era IRS targeting scandal, where the agency spent more than two years targeting conservative tax-exempt groups.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration, after years of litigation, in 2017, settled lawsuits with Tea Party and other conservative groups who say they were unfairly targeted but the IRS under the Obama administration.\u00a0\nFLASHBACK: TRUMP DOJ SETTLES LAWSUITS OVER TEA PARTY TARGETING BY OBAMA IRS\nThe targeting scandal drew heavy attention in 2013 after the IRS admitted it applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups applying for nonprofit status. Lois Lerner, then-head of the Exempt Organizations unit responsible, became the public face of the scandal, though many other IRS officials were also involved.\nIn a 2017 settlement, the IRS offered an apology, saying the agency \"admits that its treatment of Plaintiffs during the tax-exempt determination process, including screening their applications based on their names or policy positions, subjecting those applications to heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays, and demanding some Plaintiffs\u2019 information that TIGTA determined was unnecessary to the agency\u2019s determination of their tax-exempt status, was wrong.\"\n\"For such treatment, the IRS expresses its sincere apology,\" the IRS said at the time.\u00a0\nMcConnell and Braun's legislation is set to be rolled out on Thursday.",

Even the Washington Post, which is practically a broadsheet for the Democratic Party and the Biden administration, has called out Joe Biden\u2019s lies on these matters. And it is time for all of these politically correct CEOs to stop slandering Georgia, to stop slandering Republican legislators and voters, and to stand up to the social justice warriors in their companies that are asking them to engage in these boycotts.\n\nCotton said that by slandering Georgia\u2019s new election law, Democrats \u201care trying to lay the basis\u201d for pushing through their \u201cdeeply unpopular\u201d H.R. 1.\n\n\u201cBy slandering Georgia and trying to intimidate states like Texas and other states that may change their election law, the Democrats want to lay the basis passing \u2026 H.R. 1,\u201d he advised.",

Today was the last straw; I came by my office on a Saturday to try to get some work done, only to find him there, wanting to talk politics.  If it were just another co-worker, I would have no problem telling them that I have work to do, but this is my boss. I don't want to poison my relationship with him, and he does sign my reviews.  Is there some polite way to convey to a superior that I have actual work that requires my attention, without creating hurt feelings? I'm quite certain H.R. would back me up if I went to them, but I would like to avoid that. Any advice?  Are you willing to see him outside of work?  This is not a practice Miss Manners generally condones, but the request itself might be enough to alert your boss that these conversations should not be had at the office.  \u201cI enjoy exchanging political views with you,\u201d you may say, \u201cbut I am afraid that my pleasure in our conversations is getting in the way of my work.

I'd better check with them, just in case.\u201d  Dear Miss Manners: I live in an apartment building and whenever I see someone (especially when waiting for the elevator), I say hello, good morning, good evening, etc. My parents were adamant about manners, and I was raised to greet people and acknowledge them. I do this automatically, even when I'm not aware of it.  I recently had an episode where a neighbor, who has made it apparent that he and his girlfriend don't care for me, has asked me to stop greeting either of them whenever I see them. When I asked why, he said that I was pushing the boundaries of being a good neighbor. I'd never heard of this, and have no idea if I should respond as requested or just laugh it off (which I did when I thought of it).  As I run into them a few times a week, do you have any suggestions?  Swyize. This is Miss Manners' alternative to the ever-popular \u201csmize.\u201d While the latter means to \u201csmile with your eyes,\u201d Miss Manners' version means to smile without them.  You may greet your neighbors thus whenever you see them, signifying that you have heard their unneighborly request and will abide by it \u2014 but not ungrudgingly so.

The bill has 162 cosponsors, all of whom are Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe believe in determination, and we believe in overcoming the many bad balls that we have been thrown; we\u2019ve caught them, and we\u2019ve kept on going. That is not the point of H.R. 40,\u201d Jackson Lee noted in her opening statement. \u201cNow more than ever, the facts and circumstances facing our nation demonstrate the importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of placing our nation on the path to reparative justice.\u201d\n\nHilary O.

Burgess Owens (R-UT), a black conservative and former NFL star, voiced his concern over reparations, pointing to the success of black Americans in recent history.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that black American history is not one of a hapless, hopeless race oppressed by a more powerful white race,\u201d Owens said. \u201cIt\u2019s the history of millions of middle and wealthy class black Americans throughout the early 20th century, achieving the American dream.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018You give a man a fish and feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime,'\u201d Walker said. \u201cReparations are only feeding someone for a day.\u201d\u00a0Walker also insisted that racism is\u00a0\u201cbetter today than yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy religion teaches togetherness. Reparations teaches separation,\u201d Walker added in his testimony. \u201cSlavery ended over 130 years ago. How can a father ask his son to do prison time for a crime he committed?\u201d\n\nLast October, Walker appeared on Fox News Channel where he\u00a0pushed back against California legislation that would consider reparations for black people because of slavery, insisting that those who push the legislation are\u00a0\u201cjust pandering for a vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset about it because all they are doing is pandering for a vote,\u201d Walker said at the time. \u201cBecause let me tell you, why are you paying African-Americans off instead of empowering African-Americans?\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite all of the problems that have been brought up in this committee about racism, about slavery, about Jim Crow, black people have overcome to the point now where only 20 percent of black people are below the federally defined level of poverty. Still too high, but in 1940 that number was 87 percent, and 20 years later that number had been reduced to 47 percent,\u201d Elder said in his testimony.\n\n\u201cDespite all of this racism, all of this prejudice, black people still overcame,\u201d Elder continued. \u201cI also find it ironic we\u2019re having this hearing 13 years after we elected, then reelected the first black president of the United States.\u201d\n\nUnder questioning from Owens, Elder noted that \u201cgood economic policies work\u201d regardless of race.\n\n\u201cEqual rights and equal results are two very different things,\u201d Elder said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting confused about here. Everybody\u2019s entitled to equal rights, but nobody\u2019s entitled to equal results.\u201d",

John Sarbanes, D-Md., slammed Pence in response to the criticism, calling him \"Exhibit A of the corrupt status quo in Washington\" that the bill looks to end.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Most Americans \u2013 including a majority of Republican voters \u2013 support the core elements of this historic and transformational reform effort,\" Sarbanes said.\nThe bill does provide for certain security measures, including providing for a \"voter-verified paper ballot\" that voters would be able to inspect before their vote is officially cast and counted.\nH.R. 1 could also expand\u00a0who would get to vote, as it calls for a congressional task force to examine allowing residents of U.S. territories to vote, and discusses statehood for Washington, D.C.\u00a0It also opposes restrictions such as requiring voter identification or placing conditions on convicted felons before they can regain the right to vote.",

    "body": "The bill that has these politicians frothing is H.R. 1, a long piece of legislation with a noble purpose: making it easier for Americans to vote and encouraging the government to be more responsive to the people. Republicans\u2019 apocalyptic rhetoric is so wildly disproportionate to the contents of the bill, one must wonder what they are really worried about.\n\nConservatives complain that the bill would mandate early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, provisional ballots for people who accidentally vote out-of-precinct, same-day voter registration and automatic voter registration. So? There is nothing scary or even unusual about these reforms, which many states have embraced without seeing the pervasive fraud Republicans predict and claim falsely has occurred.\n\nOpponents argue that counting mail-in ballots that arrive in the days after Election Day, as long as they are mailed on time, would produce uncertainty about the results on election night. Big deal. It is far more important to count Americans\u2019 votes, even if the U.S. Postal Service delays their delivery, than it is to soothe impatient election night viewers.\n\nCritics also warn that state legislatures would have to turn over congressional district map-drawing to independent commissions. And? Extreme partisan gerrymandering makes the need for nonpartisan redistricting, which has worked in state after state that has tried it, more acute.\n\nThere is more to the bill, including an innovative campaign finance reform that would boost the power of small donors. If Republicans simply objected to that section, or a controversial provision on absentee ballot collection, or a requirement for an ethics code for Supreme Court justices, their position would be more defensible. But they seem to attack with greatest ferocity the provisions that should be least controversial: those that would encourage more Americans to vote.\n\nIn his screed against H.R. 1, Mr. Pence claimed that the last election was marked by \u201csignificant voting irregularities\u201d and that \u201cit is time for our nation\u2019s leaders to help America heal.\u201d In fact, there were no significant irregularities, and healing is needed only because Mr.\u00a0Pence and his boss lied about that, and now they are fanning unjustified fears about the supposed dangers of policies that would ease voting. Then they profess alarm that half the country mistrusts the electoral system, and they insist that the only remedy is to preserve and enhance barriers to the ballot box, restrictions that \u2014 surprise! \u2014 would discourage turnout especially among Democratic voters.\n\nH.R. 1 now moves to the Senate. If Republicans there object to elements of the bill, they should seek to amend it. If they reject the effort out-of-hand, it will be yet another sign that they have embraced a strategy of voter suppression because they fear that, if the rules are fair, they will lose.",

Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser about the bill:\n\nThe bill\u2019s broad definition of contraceptives, which applies to \u201cany device or medication used to prevent pregnancy, whether specifically used to prevent pregnancy or for other health needs,\u201d may also create federal protections for chemical abortion. Other health needs \u201ccould include noncontroversial applications of the drug but could also include the use of the drug to induce abortion,\u201d Dannenfelser wrote in a letter to Congress.\n\nBecause the definition of contraceptives in this bill is overbroad, it could mandate access to abortion drugs. H.R. 8373 states that contraceptives include drugs, devices, or biological products intended for contraception, \u201cwhether specifically intended to prevent pregnancy or for other health needs.\u201d This could include noncontroversial applications of the drug but could also include the use of the drug to induce abortion. What follows is that H.R. 8373 would then require the right to obtain a chemical abortion, the right to provide a chemical abortion, and would overturn any law that regulates chemical abortion by singling it out.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 claims, however, fly in the face of what the U.S. Supreme Court said in its Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, including specifically naming contraceptives as being completely unrelated.",

Likewise, more than 38 million Americans between 25 to 64-years-old were out of the labor force entirely last month, including three-fourths who do not have a college diploma.\n\nThe H.R. 6 amnesty would also cost American taxpayers about $35.3 billion over the course of only 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). As Camarota mentions, this cost estimate does not include the net fiscal drain locally and at the state level for taxpayers.\n\nAlready, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants a year and awards them green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, 1.4 million foreign nationals are given visas to work in the U.S. annually while hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens arrive at the southern border.\n\nThe CBO has repeatedly noted that mass immigration cuts Americans\u2019 wages.\n\nIn 2013, CBO\u00a0analysis stated\u00a0that the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty plan would \u201cslightly\u201d push down wages for the American workers.

    "body": "The bill includes, according to the progressive Brennan Center, \u201cautomatic voter registration and other steps to modernize our elections; a national guarantee of free and fair elections without voter suppression, coupled with a commitment to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act; small donor public financing to empower ordinary Americans instead of big donors (at no cost to taxpayers) and other critical campaign finance reforms; an end to partisan gerrymandering; and a much-needed overhaul of federal ethics rules.\u201dThere is new urgency for many of those provisions, given the Republicans\u2019 unprecedented effort since the 2020 election to roll back voting access on the misguided theory that less democracy is good for their party (a reaffirmation of the party\u2019s aversion to democracy and dependence on minority rule). The Brennan Center, which has been tracking these efforts, reports : \u201cThus far this year, 28 states have introduced, prefiled, or carried over 106 bills to restrict voting access. These proposals primarily seek to: (1) limit mail voting access; (2) impose stricter voter ID requirements; (3) limit successful pro-voter registration policies; and (4) enable more aggressive voter roll purges.\u201d For example, Republican lawmakers in Arizona are trying to remove voters from its early-voting list, which would prevent them from automatically receiving a mail ballot.Needless to say, the sweeping reform of H.R. 1 currently has no Republican support. So what happens to voting reform, perhaps the most significant issue for the new president and Congress after the pandemic and recession? Keep an eye on five separate factors that will affect the course of any reform effort.First, at the state level, ordinary voters who found early voting or voting by mail convenient may be annoyed to learn that lawmakers want to make it harder for them to vote. Voting rights advocates, state legislators and governors around the country are going to battle over such measures. With the closely divided Congress likely tied up with the pandemic and the economy, a good deal of the action will be at the state and even county levels. The result will determine just how much additional damage the Republican Party can do to our electoral system.Second, watch out for attorney Marc Elias, who racked up more than 60 wins in court against spurious Republican voting fraud claims in 2020. He is gearing up to do battle to challenge new restrictions. He also is moving forward with his own plans for improving election administration, such as reforming the certification process, which Republicans tried to manipulate to overturn the election; easing access to voting (as Elias put it, \u201cthe test for voting laws, rules, and practices should be whether they improve voting access and participation\u201d); maximizing ballot acceptance (e.g., making it more difficult to invalidate ballots for ticky-tacky technical errors); auditing election administration; and publishing all election rule changes online.Third, are there any elements of H.R. 1 that a bipartisan group might embrace, akin to the covid-19 aid bill that lawmakers pushed through in December? Reform of the U.S. Postal Service, additional funding for election administration and requirements for a paper ballot trail and periodic audits are among the less controversial provisions. If Democrats can be persuaded to diverge from a one-standard-fits-all model, perhaps they can reach agreement on minimum standards for all states to employ some form of early or non-excuse voting as well as online or automatic voter registration.Fourth, H.R. 1 would not restore the pre-clearance provision of the Voting Rights Act (which used to be amended by near-unanimous votes, but was invalidated by the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder ). But another bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would do so. That may be a blessing in disguise. Presented as a stand-alone bill, the John Lewis bill would restore the Justice Department\u2019s ability to head off measures that erect hurdles to voting before they are implemented. Consideration of the bill would in essence become a referendum on voter suppression. Republicans might still thwart the bill using the filibuster, but that brings us to the next issue to watch.If the Republican Party persistently refuses to hold an up-or-down vote even on the John Lewis bill (aside the larger H.R. 1 for a moment), Democrats will face immense pressure to modify if not do away entirely with the filibuster either before the 2022 midterms or after (especially if Democrats pick up a couple of Senate seats). That may be the ultimate showdown on just how much ground Democrats are willing to concede to a Republican Party that rejects the sanctity of elections, the concept of majority rule and even the notion of a multiracial democracy not dominated by its White base. The debate will be critical to the future of our democracy.Read more:The Post\u2019s View: Republicans want more voter suppression.

    "body": "But his position on the filibuster may need some adjustment if his own stated standard for bipartisan electoral reform is to prevail. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right First, let's focus on why Manchin is right to nix the Democratic Party's dream elections bill, For the People Act (H.R. 1/S.B. 1), in its current form. Not only does it contain components that are dubious on policy grounds , including campaign finance provisions that would increase funds for extremists such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). It also has items that are poison pills for Republicans, such as mandatory \u201csame-day\u201d registration and eliminating voter identification requirements for on-demand vote-by-mail. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement H.R. 1 passed the House with zero Republican votes , and the companion S.B. 1 has zero GOP support in the Senate . That's because it's a purely partisan bill aimed at helping the Democratic Party win elections, not impartial reform designed to foster fair electoral competition in America's traditional two-party system. If Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), keep saying that H.R. 1/S.B. 1, as currently drafted, is essential to secure democracy, they are self-deceived or deceitful. Same-day registration is hardly necessary for the preservation of self-government. The same goes for no-excuse absentee voting: as long as all eligible voters have adequate in-person opportunities to cast a ballot, and excuse-based absentee voting exists for those who can't get to the polls \u2014 as it did for decades in most states \u2014 democracy can survive without on-demand, vote-by-mail for everyone. And reasonable voter ID rules are not voter suppression; in fact, making voters provide a driver's license or other easily available ID number is a way to avoid imprecise and arbitrary signature-matching requirements that pose a greater risk of disenfranchising valid voters. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Moreover, adopting H.R. 1/S.B. 1 over the objection of every Republican in Congress would be a disaster for democracy, which is still struggling to regain its footing in the aftermath of former president Donald Trump's \u201cbig lie\u201d about the 2020 election being stolen. What's most imperative for the preservation of democracy in 2022 and 2024 is the willingness of Republicans to accept vote tallies showing that their candidates lost. Achieving this becomes a lot harder if the rules for casting those ballots are forced upon them by a party-line vote \u2014 especially when those rules are drawn from the Democratic Party's wish list of measures that facilitate their own turnout efforts. Manchin, therefore, is doing everyone a favor by forcing Democrats to eliminate from S.B. 1 those elements that are anathema to Republicans; he is also opening the door for a deal between reasonable Democrats and Republicans who are still willing to collaborate in good faith. In an op-ed on Sunday , Manchin observed that seven GOP senators courageously stood up for democracy when they voted to convict Trump at his second impeachment trial for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection. If Democrats can't craft an electoral reform bill that wins the support of these seven Republicans \u2014 or the largely overlapping group of GOP senators who supported the independent Jan. 6 commission \u2014 then Democrats need to ask themselves: Whose fault is that? Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Manchin has now made it clear, although some are having a hard time hearing the message, that Senate Democrats must negotiate a retooled S.B. 1 that gets reasonable Republicans on board, or they won't have any chance at electoral reform at all. (The separate John Lewis voting rights bill, although worthy, is not a substitute, especially on redistricting.) Manchin's message leaves a nagging question: what happens if he brokers a deal with all seven GOP senators who voted to convict Trump, and perhaps also Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) ( who voted for the Jan. 6 commission) as an eighth, but he can't find a ninth and tenth Republican to overcome a filibuster? It is too soon to know. With no change to filibuster procedures, that risks leaving electoral reform that meets Manchin's test of \u201cboth Democrats and Republicans coming together\u201d vetoed by a couple of votes. It would mean even a bill essential to protect the republic from authoritarian efforts to repudiate honest elections would fail because a filibuster threshold that once was 67 votes , and now is 60 votes, can't be revised again to 57 or 58 votes. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Manchin is understandably reluctant to tinker with the filibuster, knowing the shoe sooner or later will be on the other foot. But a small tweak might be necessary to achieve his own priority of bipartisan democracy preservation. Read more: Dana Milbank: The covid vaccine did change my DNA.

McMaster once skewered a US colonel in Afghanistan after he suggested that Afghans were inherently more corrupt than Americans, according to Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff's new book, \"Midnight In Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy and Still Could.\"\nThe exchange, which Schiff witnessed, took place during a trip to Kabul before Donald Trump became president. The California Democrats said he made the trip to oversee \"rule-of-law issues\" in Afghanistan, and that he was impressed with McMaster's commitment to the US' Afghan partners.\nAccording to Schiff's book, he witnessed McMaster giving a dressing down to a US colonel for suggesting that Afghans were inherently corrupt.\n\"They are no more inherently corrupt than we are, and they are fighting and dying beside us every day, so you should show some respect,\" McMaster told the officer, the book said.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        Schiff recounted the story in a passage detailing his disappointment when McMaster defended then White House advisor Jared Kushner's efforts to establish a secret backchannel of communication with Russia. News of Kushner's efforts sent shockwaves through the political and media ecosystem at the time, with national security veterans describing Kushner's actions as unprecedented and highly unusual.\nMcMaster defended Kushner, saying on cable news that the US had a long history of having backchannels with other countries. But Schiff called that assertion \"preposterous,\" writing, \"Yes, there are time when the United States government has used back-channel communications with nations like Cuba or Iran. But those back channels are designed to facilitate communication for our government, not to conceal information from our government, and for McMaster to suggest otherwise was more than disingenuous, it was dangerous.\"\nMcMaster was one of six national security advisors, including those in acting capacities, who served Trump. He took over the role in early 2017 following the resignation of Gen. Michael Flynn, who was forced to step down after it surfaced that he lied about his contacts with Russia's ambassador.\nMcMaster  resigned in April 2018 amid a string of policy disagreements with Trump and an increasingly sour relationship with the president. He was followed by John Bolton, who also resigned and was succeded by Robert O'Brien. Before joining the Trump White House, McMaster had a long military career that included posts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "A group of prominent border hawks who formerly served in senior roles within the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday pointed the finger not only at the Biden administration for the ongoing crisis at the southern border but also at Republican lawmakers for not doing enough despite tough rhetoric.\n\n\"It shocks me that a border security bill hasn't been introduced that would get full Republican support,\" said Mark Morgan, who served as chief of Border Patrol and acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \"It should have been HR 1 [the first bill of the new Congress].\"\n\nMorgan was one of the border experts on a press call hosted by the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., where he and colleagues called out Republicans for not doing more on border security. They especially targeted a small number of GOP lawmakers for obstructing a bill designed to address the historic flow of illegal immigrants into the country under the Biden administration.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, introduced the Border Safety and Security Act, or H.R. 29, which would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to turn away illegal immigrants who present themselves at the border \"during any period when DHS cannot detain such an individual or return the individual to a foreign country.\" The legislation is designed to relieve the pressure at overwhelmed detention centers along the southern border and prevent the mass release of migrants into the U.S.\n\nSTATE OF THE UNION 2023: BORDER OFFICIALS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN\u2019S 'MADDENING' REMARKS ON MIGRANT CRISIS\n\n\"It's a commonsense bill that requires the Biden administration to enforce the law, has consequences for those who violate it, and ends catch and release,\" said Morgan. \"It doesn't include everything but at least puts us a step in the right direction.\"\n\nCatch and release refers to the practice of releasing an illegal immigrant into the U.S. while they await immigration court hearings rather than holding them in detention.\n\nSome Republicans \u2014 especially Reps. Don Bacon, Neb., Tony Gonzales, Texas, and Maria Elvira Salazar, Fla. \u2014 have criticized and held up the bill from moving forward, drawing the ire of border hawks.\n\n\"I have to say Gonzales before the election and him now is a stark 180,\" said Lora Ries, who spent several years serving in various roles at DHS. \"This seems to be a power move for him in the House. And I've got to say, the people of Texas, the people of America deserve a lot better. They were lied to.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN REMOVING MOST SURVEILLANCE BALLOONS AT SOUTHERN BORDER DUE TO COST: SOURCES\n\nGonzales argues his objections to H.R. 29 are substantive, not political.\n\n\"H.R. 29 is all hat and no cattle. It would essentially prevent legal asylum claims such as migrants fleeing religious or political persecution from a safe haven in the United States,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Not only is this radical position un-American; it would worsen our border crisis and incentivize human smugglers to continue sneaking people into our country illegally. Instead of messaging on a bill that has 0.00% chance of passing into law we should fix the root problems of our broken immigration system.\"\n\nRies, Morgan, and Tom Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement who was also on the call, rejected the notion that the bill would prevent legal, legitimate asylum.\n\nUnder U.S. law, in order to receive asylum, individuals leaving their own country are supposed to show past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. However, the Heritage experts argued that, with the encouragement of the Biden administration's rhetoric and policies, the system is being exploited by millions of economic migrants who may be fleeing hardship but don't meet the bar of asylum.\n\nSoaring asylum cases have led to a record years-long backlog in U.S. immigration courts.\n\nREP. ROY INTRODUCES BILL TO BLOCK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AS HOUSE GOP FIRES UP BORDER PUSH\n\nGonzales introduced his own border security bill last month after becoming the lone GOP congressman from Texas not to endorse a proposed border security framework focused on resurrecting many of the policies of the Trump administration. His legislation would boost funding to a grant program \"that allows local law enforcement to augment border patrol efforts at the southern border.\"\n\nHowever, the ex-DHS officials said that, while more funding helps, the current border crisis is the result of policy changes since President Biden entered office, not a lack of money.\n\n\"Some Republicans just want to throw resources at the problem and call it solved,\" said Morgan. \"The disaster at the border isn't due to a lack of resources but policy changes. We need more resources, but just throwing resources at the border without different policy isn't a solution.\"\n\nRies, Morgan, and Homan all noted House Republicans' \"Commitment to America,\" which laid out a policy agenda if the GOP retook the House in the midterm elections, calls for ending catch and release.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation was one of several groups that signed a letter organized by border hawks and former Trump administration officials demanding House Republicans keep their campaign promises contained in the Commitment to America by passing H.R. 29 and other strong border security measures. Fox News Digital first reported on the letter earlier this week.\n\nBORDER HAWKS SAY FAILURE TO PASS BORDER SECURITY BILL WOULD BETRAY GOP 'COMMITMENT TO AMERICA'\n\nSome GOP holdouts have said they're concerned not just about the substance of the bill but the process by which it goes through Congress.\n\n\"My primary goal is to have this bill go through committee and regular order, so that all members of the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees can review and improve it as needed,\" Bacon told Fox News Digital earlier this week. \"Some critics have said the bill could totally shut down asylum requests. I'm not sure that is the case, which is why this bill needs to go through the regular process. This new majority has agreed to regular order, and we shouldn't deviate from that in the first few weeks of this new Congress.\"\n\nBacon added that \"real conservatives respect regular order\" and \"fought to make that a reality in this Congress.\"\n\nBorder hawks countered that action is needed now given the scale of the border crisis.\n\n\"Illegal immigration isn't a victimless crime,\" said Homan. \"A third of the women who make the journey and use cartels are sexually assaulted. We see the number of deaths on the southern border right around 1,700 since Joe Biden became president, which is a record.\"\n\nDHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS HAS VIOLATED OATH OF OFFICE, MUST BE IMPEACHED, HERITAGE FOUNDATION ARGUES\n\nHoman explained that due to an overwhelming number of illegal immigrants entering the country, well over 50% of agents are often pulled off guarding the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico border to process, care for, and transfer migrants, leaving huge gaps for cartels and smugglers to exploit.\n\nSince Biden entered office, there's been a sharp rise in the number of people who have crossed the southern border illegally. The figure reached a record 2.38 million illegal crossings encountered by U.S. authorities in fiscal year 2022 (which ended Sept. 30) and a record 251,487 just in December, the latest month for which data's available, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. There has been over 200,000 such migrant encounters for 10 months straight.\n\n\"When you create a crisis this big, it creates other issues,\" said Homan, who described how drug smuggling and sex trafficking across the border has surged as a result.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, about 1.2 million illegal immigrant \"gotaways\" are known to have evaded U.S. authorities. Border Patrol has also arrested dozens of suspected terrorists and over this time and thousands of people with criminal convictions, according to border agents.\n\nEarlier this week, Heritage released a report, coauthored by Rise, making the case that Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has violated his oath of office and must be impeached.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut border hawks are also directing their focus to Congress, with both Morgan and Homan noting Republicans didn't pass major immigration measures even when former President Trump was in office. Most of the border security changes put in place during the Trump administration were the result of executive, not legislative, action.\n\n\"How many more people have to die until we stop playing politics as usual? It's time for Republicans to follow through on their promises,\" said Morgan, who called for H.R. 29 to be brought to the House floor for a vote s quickly as possible. \"The American people can know for sure where each member of Congress stands on border security and saving the lives of migrants.\"",

    "body": "The Biden administration will attempt to end Title 42, a Trump-era border order used to expel certain illegal migrants to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, May 11, according to a Monday White House memorandum.\n\nThe White House will end the national and public health emergency for COVID-19 and thus attempt to end the border order, according to the memo. The decision comes after the highest month on record for migrant encounters in December, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded more than 250,000 migrant encounters. (RELATED: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Appoints State\u2019s First \u2018Border Czar\u2019)\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in April that the public health order would end May 23, 2022. Republican states subsequently brought legal battles and the fate of the order remains uncertain as a result of those efforts.\n\n\u201cThe end of the public health emergency will end the Title 42 policy at the border. While the Administration has attempted to terminate the Title 42 policy and continues to support an orderly lifting of those restrictions, Title 42 remains in place because of orders issued by the Supreme Court and a district court in Louisiana. Enactment of H.R. 382 would lift Title 42 immediately, and result in a substantial additional inflow of migrants at the Southwest border,\u201d the memo stated.\n\nThe Biden administration recently implemented parole programs for Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans that allow migrants from those countries to skirt Title 42 expulsion.\n\n\u201cThe number of migrants crossing the border has been cut in half, approximately, since the Administration put in place a plan in early January to deter irregular migration from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti. The Administration supports an orderly, predictable wind-down of Title 42, with sufficient time to put alternative policies in place. But if H.R. 382 becomes law and the Title 42 restrictions end precipitously, Congress will effectively be requiring the Administration to allow thousands of migrants per day into the country immediately without the necessary policies in place,\u201d the memo stated.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "body": "say is an urgent effort to fight Republican efforts in states across the country to restrict ballot access . If passed, the bill would mark a huge expansion of voting rights, and a major overhaul of campaign finance and redistricting laws. Republicans say they want to stop it in the Senate. Republicans at the state level across the country have proposed a wide range of measures , many in response to allowances that were made for voting during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The measures include curtailing eligibility to vote by mail, prohibiting the use of ballot drop boxes, and in the case of Georgia \u2014 where the GOP lost two Senate seats and which voted for a Democratic president for the first time since Bill Clinton's 1992 win \u2014 blocking early voting on Sundays. That particular measure has been called a flagrant and obvious attempt to disenfranchise Black voters in the state. The chairman of Georgia's new House Special Committee on Election Integrity, state Rep. Barry Fleming (R), said his committee's mission is to \u201crestore the confidence of our public in our elections system,\u201d an allusion to the false claims spread by former president Donald Trump about voter fraud in the 2020 election. GOP officials in Arizona, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 all states that could have an impact on future presidential elections \u2014 are also considering legislation that would restrict voting. That's why Democrats are moving forward with their bill at the national level, and while it might not pass in the Senate, they want to put pressure on Republicans, who have called it a political power grab. \u201cIt is not designed to protect Americans' vote \u2014 it is designed to put a thumb on the scale in every election in America, so that Democrats can turn a temporary majority into permanent control,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Tuesday. Here's what the bill actually contains: A set of national voter registration and mail-in voting standards: H.R. 1 requires the chief election official in each state \u2014 the secretary of state in most \u2014 to establish an automatic voter-registration system that gathers individuals' information from government databases and registers them unless they intentionally opt out. And it says it's the government's responsibility to keep that information up-to-date, based on information from agencies like state motor vehicle administrations, agencies that receive money from Social Security or the Affordable Care Act, the justice system, and federal agencies including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Social Security Administration and others. The law would also guarantee voters same-day registration either at early voting sites or at precincts on Election Day. Each state would be required to allow at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections, for at least 10 hours a day with at least some time before 9 a.m. and after 5 p.m. The law would limit how states can purge voter rolls. Nonpartisan redistricting commissions: In an attempt to get rid of gerrymandering, the law would require each state to use independent commissions (not made up of lawmakers) to approve newly drawn congressional districts. The commissions would each include five Democrats, five Republicans and five independents, requiring bipartisan approval for districts to be allowed. \u201cRegardless of whether it's a red state or a blue state, we are seeing significant manipulation in the legislative redrawing of districts,\u201d said Tom Lopach, CEO of the nonpartisan Voter Participation Center, which has advocated for the bill. \u201cH.R. 1 presents an opportunity for everyone to get onboard with independent, unbiased and balanced redistricting that frankly is good government.\u201d It would also give the public a whole new level of scrutiny, and a chance to object to badly drawn districts. The law would require a public comment period and give citizens a legal basis to challenge gerrymandering. (Currently, gerrymandering challenges have to be made on constitutional grounds, and if a law were passed, there would be a clearer argument to present in court against gerrymandered districts.) Big changes in campaign finance law: H.R. 1 would require super PACs and \u201cdark money\u201d groups to disclose their donors publicly, a step Democrats say would eliminate one of the most opaque parts of the U.S. election process. It would establish a public funding match for small-dollar donations, financed by a fee on corporations and banks paying civil or criminal penalties. It would also require Facebook and Twitter to publicly report the source and amount of money spent on political ads. New ethics rules for public servants: The bill would create the first ethics code for Supreme Court justices, to be created within a year of the bill's passage. It would also stop a controversial practice in Congress: When a member of Congress settles a sexual harassment or discrimination lawsuit, in certain cases they can use taxpayer money to settle. H.R. 1 would prevent taxpayer money from being used for such settlements. The bill would also create more oversight on lobbyists and foreign agents. A requirement that presidential candidates disclose their tax returns: This one is a little more relevant to recent events. Democrats have been frustrated for years that Trump never released his tax returns, and H.R. 1 would require it by law. Can it pass in the Senate? Senate Democrats plan to move the bill forward, but Republicans in the chamber have been very public with their pledge to fight it forcefully. A similar House bill was passed in 2019 , and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote. Current Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has promised to end what he called McConnell's \u201clegislative graveyard,\u201d and bring more bills passed by the House to the floor to force votes. But if they actually want it to pass, Democrats don't have a lot of options. Unlike the coronavirus relief package making its way through the Senate, for which Schumer only needs 50 votes plus Vice President Harris's tiebreaker, H.R. 1 isn't being passed through the special reconciliation process that requires a simple majority. Democrats' other option is to eliminate part or all of the legislative filibuster \u2014 a political bombshell that would allow them to pass much more legislation with just 50 votes and Harris's tiebreaker. Even if they do pass it, it would probably come up against lawsuits. The conservative Heritage Foundation has called many of the bill's provisions unconstitutional, and given how opposed congressional Republicans are to it, legal challenges seem inevitable.

    "body": "The House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill Monday providing massive tax benefits for American workers\u2019 retirement savings accounts.\nThe Securing a Strong Retirement Act, H.R. 2954, more commonly known as the Secure Act 2.0, was approved on a 414-5 vote with strong bipartisan support. The bill aims to create a $1,000 tax credit for workers at small businesses that offer savings plans, allowing employees to automatically enroll in retirement plans rather than requiring them to sign up individually. (RELATED: Massive Number Of Americans leave Retirement To Rejoin Workforce)\n \u201cH.R. 2954 will help all Americans successfully save for a secure retirement by expanding coverage and increasing retirement savings, simplifying the current retirement system, and protecting Americans and their retirement accounts,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, who sponsored the bill, said on the House floor Tuesday. \u201cToo many workers reach retirement age without having the savings they need.\u201d\n \u201cWe need to do more to encourage workers to begin planning for retirement earlier,\u201d Neal said. \u201cAnd we need to make saving easier.\u201d\n    The bill also aims to help Americans who are approaching retirement but have not actively contributed to their savings accounts. Roughly half of adults between the ages of 55 and 66 did not have any form of retirement savings in 2017, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n \u201cOur bill, SECURE 2.0 improves workers\u2019 long-term financial wellbeing, by helping more Americans save for retirement at every stage of their life,\u201d Republican Leader on the House Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady said on the House floor Tuesday. \u201cBy providing flexibility, for example, we make it easier for local businesses to tailor retirement plans to best fit the needs of their workers.\u201d\n \u201cThese reforms help Americans not only save earlier in their careers, but it helps families save longer, as well,\u201d Brady added.\n Other provisions allow workers who began their careers later in life to contribute up to $10,000 in their retirement accounts each year, but require those savings to be taxed before entering the account. The legislation would also increase the necessary age for required minimum distributions from 72 to 75.\n \n If the legislation is enacted, workers still paying off student loan debt will also receive matching contributions from their employers.\n Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We are in a fight for our survival as a Constitutional Republic like no other time since our founding in 1776. The conflict is between supporters of Socialism and Marxism vs. supporters of Constitutional freedom and liberty,\u201d the retired officers wrote.\n\nThey slammed the 2020 election process and\u00a0argued that\u00a0Democrat House bill H.R. 1 and its Senate companion bill S. 1 would destroy election fairness and allow Democrats to forever remain in power. They wrote:\n\nWithout fair and honest elections that accurately reflect the \u2018will of the people\u2019 our Constitutional Republic is lost. Election integrity demands insuring there is one legal vote cast and counted per citizen. Legal votes are identified by State Legislature\u2019s approved controls using government IDs, verified signatures, etc. Today, many are calling such commonsense controls \u2018racist\u2019 in an attempt to avoid having fair and honest elections. Using racial terms to suppress proof of eligibility is itself a tyrannical intimidation tactic. Additionally, the \u2018Rule of Law\u2019 must be enforced in our election processes to ensure integrity. The FBI and Supreme Court must act swiftly when election irregularities are surfaced and not ignore them as was done in 2020. Finally, H.R.1 & S.1, (if passed), would destroy election fairness and allow Democrats to forever remain in power violating our Constitution and ending our Representative Republic.\n\nThey also slammed the Biden administration for acting in a \u201cdictatorial manner\u201d by bypassing Congress with more than 50 executive orders reversing Trump administration policies and blasted excessive lockdowns, school and business closures, and censorship of written and verbal expression as direct assaults on Americans\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nThey also weighed in on national security issues from the southern border, China, and energy.\n\n\u201cIllegals are flooding our Country bringing high economic costs, crime, lowering wages, and illegal voting in some states. We must reestablish border controls and continue building the wall while supporting our dedicated border control personnel.\u00a0Sovereign nations must have controlled borders,\u201d they said.\n\nThey called China \u201cthe greatest external threat to America,\u201d and said establishing cooperative relations with the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 as the Biden administration is doing \u2014 emboldens them to continue progress toward world domination, militarily, economically, politically and technologically. \u201cWe must impose more sanctions and restrictions to impede their world domination goal and protect America\u2019s interests,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey also called for opening the Keystone Pipeline to regain energy independence. \u201cStopping the Keystone Pipeline eliminates our recently established energy independence and causes us to be energy dependent on nations not friendly to us, while eliminating valuable US jobs. We must open the Keystone Pipeline and regain our energy independence for national security and economic reasons,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey argued that the military should not be used as \u201cpolitical pawns\u201d to protect the Capitol against a \u201cnon-existent threat,\u201d and should not be forced to accept politically correct policies or critical race theory into the military at the expense of war fighting. \u201cWe must support our Military and Vets; focus on war fighting, eliminate the corrosive infusion of Political Correctness into our military which damages morale and war fighting cohesion,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey blasted \u201canarchy\u201d in certain cities and called on Americans to support law enforcement personnel and insist that district attorneys, courts, and the Justice Department enforce the law equally, fairly, and consistently toward all.\n\nThey also argued that the mental and physical condition of the Commander-in-Chief \u201ccannot be ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must be able to quickly make accurate national security decisions involving life and limb anywhere, day or night,\u201d they said.\n\n2021 Open Letter From Retired Generals and Admirals 9 May 2021 by Kristina Wong on Scribd",

    "body": "Second Amendment advocate Colion Noir slams party's gun control moves as 'disingenuous' on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight'\n\n\n\n\nSecond Amendment activist and attorney Colion Noir warned Tuesday that Congress appears poised to forever change the gun rights landscape in America with sweeping legislation already making its way through the U.S. House.\nNoir told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that two bills in the House could do lasting damage to the Constitutional rights of millions of people while at the same time further empowering the federal government.\nNoir cited H.R. 8, a bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., that would ban private sales of firearms without a licensed\u00a0intermediary conducting a background check,\u00a0and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's\u00a0H.R. 127; a comprehensive overhaul of gun rights that includes required\u00a0psychological evaluations and family interviews by federally-approved individuals\u00a0for gun purchases and\u00a0licensing of ammunition while prohibiting several calibers thereof, as well onerous firearms-related fees and several other edicts.\nIn order for the Senate, as currently constituted,\u00a0to\u00a0pass both Thompson's and Jackson Lee's bills, they would likely have to abolish the filibuster, which many Democrats support doing, host Tucker Carlson noted. President Biden separately has vowed to potentially take executive action on gun control.\n\"This is predictable,\" Carlson told Noir. \"Some lunatic commits a\u00a0horrifying crime,\u00a0 therefore the\u00a0rest of us aren't allowed to\u00a0defend ourselves.\u00a0Does this have aCarlson asked.ny chance of\u00a0happening, do you think?\"\n\"Now?\u00a0Yeah, largely because of the way\u00a0things look in Congress and as\u00a0you pointed out earlier, that's why that\u00a0Georgia [U.S. Senate]\u00a0election was so\u00a0incredibly important,\" Noir said.\u00a0\"I know I made a series of videos\u00a0talking about that.\"\nNoir said the restrictive bills coming through Congress have nothing to do with saving lives from mass shooters.\n\"Look at H.R. 8 and the other bill (H.R. 127) that just passed the House now\u00a0going to go to the Senate, none\u00a0of those would have\u00a0stopped any of the most recent shootings that we have had,\" he said. \"None of them.\u00a0So why are we pushing policy that's not going to do anything\u00a0other than grant more power to\u00a0the government?\nDEMOCRATS PUSH TIGHTER GUN CONTROL\u00a0LAWS AFTER BOULDER MASSACRE\n\"That's the overarching goal there\u00a0and I think a lot of people\u00a0really have to start\u00a0understanding that and take it\u00a0for what it is.\"\nNoir went on to suggest that not enough Americans listened to warnings about how far left the Democratic ticket was when they voted\u00a0on Election Day:\n\"A lot of people didn't really\u00a0heed that warning because they\u00a0wanted to vote along party\u00a0lines, which again, the lack of\u00a0independent thought is becoming\u00a0increasingly more\u00a0dangerous.\"\nNoir later added\u00a0that many people \"undervalue\" the Second Amendment, looking at it as a protection for game hunters, rather than for civilians\u00a0against a tyrannical government.\nAs for the new push to ban AR-15s, Noir warned such an effort \"serves as\u00a0an excellent precursor for them\u00a0to inevitably get to the point\u00a0they really want to get to, which\u00a0is essentially [banning] the handguns.\u00a0They can sell the whole idea of\u00a0the AR-15 needing to be banned\u00a0and evil and only meant for\u00a0killing, as they like to say, which is not true.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Once they get that... and\u00a0we\u00a0have another shooting that\u00a0happens, which it will, they will go ahead and\u00a0use that to justify further\u00a0restricting our rights again.\u00a0So they will take a little bit\u00a0at a time, wait for another\u00a0tragedy and take a little bit\u00a0after that,\" he said.\n\"That's why I implore people, when\u00a0they elect these, officials there\u00a0are consequences for this\u00a0because they are supposed to be\u00a0our representatives.\u00a0So as long as we continue to\u00a0elect them without any\u00a0recourse, whenever they do\u00a0things like vote for gun\u00a0control, we are going to\u00a0continue to see this over and\u00a0over and over again. Before you know it, we won't\u00a0have a Second Amendment.\"",

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) of \u201cdooming our democracy in the name of bipartisanship\u201d after announcing over the weekend that he would not support the sweeping federal election reform measure known as H.R. 1.\n\n\n\n\nRep. Mondaire Jones (D-NY) wrote in an essay published Wednesday on the website Democracy Docket that Manchin did not have any \u201csubstantive concerns\u201d about the legislation, also known as the For The People Act. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat Senator Manchin wants is a bipartisan bill \u2014 whatever it says,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cBut if there aren\u2019t 10 Republicans willing to investigate an insurrection that almost claimed their lives, there aren\u2019t 10 Republicans willing to protect our democracy.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCompromising the bill simply will not solve our problem,\u201d Jones added. \u201cOur best hope remains to move Senator Manchin to choose democracy over bipartisanship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSen. Joe Manchin has said he would not give backing to H.R. 1.Alex Wong/Pool via AP\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Manchin met with civil rights leaders to discuss his opposition to the legislation, which is meant to counter election reform measures recently enacted in states like Georgia. Manchin described the meeting to reporters as \u201cexcellent\u201d before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody changed positions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOne of the civil rights leaders, Marc Morial, told CNN that Manchin was \u201cfairly well dug in\u201d in his opposition to the legislation. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe may get to a point where the dialogue reaches a dead end,\u201d Morial added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchin has suggested that Democrats and activists support narrower legislation that updates the Voting Rights Act to reinstate a requirement that new voting laws and legislative districts in certain states be subject to federal approval. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, Jones said Wednesday that legislation \u201cis no substitute for the transformative democracy reforms contained in the For the People Act. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d Jones went on to point out even if Manchin does support the narrower measure, known as H.R. 4, it is still unlikely to gain enough GOP support to win the 60 votes necessary to pass the Senate. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we are going to make an exception to the filibuster for democracy reforms \u2014 which we absolutely must do \u2014 let\u2019s do it for legislation that is actually going to save and strengthen our democracy,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cWe cannot let this Jim Crow relic cement the new Jim Crow \u2026 By dooming our democracy in the name of bipartisanship, Senator Manchin is betraying both.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMondaire Jones added that compromise won\u2019t help solve the problem of passing the voting bill. CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imag\n\n\n\nManchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have repeatedly stated that they will not support any move to abolish the legislative filibuster, which requires most legislation to receive 60 votes to pass the Senate. Though the pair are the most outspoken supporters of the filibuster, with Manchin catching most of the heat from progressives, The Daily Beast reported Thursday that a handful of other Democratic senators quietly support Manchin and Sinema\u2019s position. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are other Democratic members who share his reservations about eliminating the filibuster,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told the outlet. \u201cPerhaps they\u2019re less outspoken, and perhaps less vehement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhile some conservative commentators have suggested that Manchin switch parties rather than deal with continual pressure from Democrats to support far-left legislation, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Fox News Thursday that he was \u201cnot anticipating\u201d that happening. \n\n\n\n\nManchin has stated he won\u2019t get behind any movement to eliminate the filibuster.Susan Walsh/Pool via Reuters\n\n\n\n\u201cI do admire his willingness to protect the Senate as an institution,\u201d McConnell said of Manchin on \u201cAmerica Reports\u201d. \u201cThe filibuster is not so much about a particular issue as it is about the Senate as an institution. It was constructed in the beginning of the country to slow things down, to make sure the right things were done for the country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWith Post wires",

    "body": "ORLANDO, Florida \u2014 Democrats seek to use language to control the narrative and shape perception \u2014 something they have done in pushing their radical proposals, from H.R. 1 to the Equality Act \u2014 Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) warned during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Saturday.\n\nAppearing at CPAC, Boebert spoke about the Democrats\u2019 radical policy proposals \u2014 from the Equality Act, which passed in the House last week, to H.R. 1, which passed in the House Wednesday evening. At the root of these proposals is the Democrats\u2019 grander attempt, she said, to use language to control the narrative and shape perception.\n\n\u201cIf they control then language, they control the narrative. And if they control the narrative, they control perception, and right now in America, it seems that perception is reality,\u201d she said, stressing that it is up to the Senate to hold the line as the House continues to advance House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) radical proposals, such as the Equality Act, which she forcefully stood against in a fiery floor speech last week.\n\n\u201cDemocrats truly have traded the truth for a lie. The truth is, there are two genders. You can\u2019t just make up how many genders we have. \u2026 This Equality Act who is it equal for? Who is it providing equality to? Certainly not women. I\u2019m a woman. I have five nieces, and what about my nieces who now have to look behind their backs to make sure that there isn\u2019t some confused man creeping in the bathroom trying to catch a peek at them?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIs it equal for the parents who are at risk of having their child taken from their custody because they refuse to inject their child with hormone blockers?\u201d she asked, explaining that she is \u201ctired\u201d of Republicans remaining on defense on the issue.\n\n\u201cIs that really what they [Democrats] want? They want our children to mutilate their bodies before they\u2019re even adults and make these harsh life-altering decisions? We need to go on offense about this. There Equality Act is not equal for any American in the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nH.R. 1, which she dubbed the \u201cFor the Swamp Act,\u201d is another radical proposal that must be stopped, Boebert insisted.\n\n\u201cWe have H.R. 1 and the Democrats, they call this the \u2018For the People Act.\u2019 No. It\u2019s the \u2018For the Swamp Act.\u2019 This is something that will federalize our elections. It\u2019s a D.C. takeover of our elections,\u201d Boebert explained. \u201cThis goes right back to them controlling the language. They act like it\u2019s something that\u2019s great for you.\u00a0 \u2026 They act like all of these things are wonderful for the American people, and they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty much, if the title of a bill sounds wonderful, run. Run, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut the \u2018For the People Act,\u2019 \u2018For the Swamp Act,\u2019 you know, this actually has tax dollars that will pay for politicians\u2019 campaigns. It\u2019s disgusting. No tax dollar should go to a campaign.\u201d\n\nPelosi and the Democrats, she said, are making \u201cterrible decisions,\u201d and it is \u201ctime the American people take a stand and take our country back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need the Senate to hold the line, and the Senate is America\u2019s hope right now, so we need people all over contacting their senators, calling them. Those phone calls matter. The letters matter. We have logs of who calls in, and it makes a difference when those numbers start to grow on certain topics. So we need people engaged,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Colorado congresswoman also criticized the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal overwhelmingly backed by Democrats, noting that, once again, Democrats are using language to \u201cmake Republicans just look like mean, bad people.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we know that there\u2019s still $1 trillion that\u2019s already been passed and approved that\u2019s unspent. Let\u2019s spend that $1 trillion before loading up a brand new bill full of pork,\u201d she said, asking why art institutions are getting \u201cmillions of dollars when the Americans people are sitting at home waiting on a $1,400 check.\u201d\n\n\u201cProgressives are incentivizing Americans to vote for Democrats because they think they\u2019re someone going to get some sort of bonus from it. Maybe $2,000 checks,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, no. We\u2019re getting a president who\u2019s bringing us back into endless wars, and just making money out of thin air.\u201d",

Heritage Action will target Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, Texas and Wisconsin, all considered key swing states after the 2020 election.\u00a0\n\"Fair elections are essential for every policy debate in the future,\" Heritage Action Executive Director Jessica Anderson said in a statement.\u00a0\"We are working to help state lawmakers restore trust in our elections, ensure transparency, and protect the rights of every American to a fair election.

But\u00a0Republicans said that mail voting is less secure than in-person voting.\nStates generally kept or even expanded their mail ballot systems for the general election. The speedy implementation of these processes raised concerns of ballot harvesting, that ballots could be mailed to voters who no longer live at a certain location due to outdated voter rolls, and more.\u00a0\nShifting election rules were some of the\u00a0key gripes from former President Donald Trump and those who supported his false claims that he won the presidential election. But despite intense scrutiny, no fraud widespread enough to overturn the result in any individual state was found.\u00a0\nCongressional Democrats are aiming to make permanent some of the widespread changes that states put in place for the 2020 presidential election.\n\n      Mass-mail-in ballots sit atop junk mail in a trash can beside a Las Vegas, Nev., apartment building, October 2020. Photo courtesy of Jim Murphy.\n      \n\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS PASS EXTENSIVE VOTING AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL H.R. 1\nThe bill,\u00a0H.R. 1, would eliminate all voter I.D. requirements; make it harder for states to clean up outdated voter rolls; mandate automatic voter registration for individuals who are registered with state or federal offices within a state; and mandate no-excuse absentee voting in all states, among many other things.\u00a0\nAnderson said\u00a0that the Heritage Action state-level effort is partially an answer to H.R. 1, which passed\u00a0the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives but is unlikely to clear a 60-vote filibuster hurdle in the Senate.\u00a0\n\"Fair and free elections matter to every American,\" Anderson said.\u00a0\"While we are working to prevent federal election takeovers like HR 1, voting safeguards have to start with the states. That is why we are now deploying Heritage Action's extensive grassroots network for state-level advocacy for the first time ever.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHeritage Action will push for stricter rules on voter I.D., citizenship verification and\u00a0ballot harvesting. It will also advocate for laws that will make it easier for states to clean their voter rolls and for election observers to oversee the voting and ballot-counting processes.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, President Biden on Sunday signed an executive order designed to increase voter access as he backs the passage of the likely-doomed H.R. 1.\u00a0\nAccording to the White House, Biden's executive order modernizes Vote.gov, orders federal agencies to expand access to voter registration, provides voting access and education to prisoners in federal custody, examines barriers to citizens with disabilities voting and improves ballot tracking for overseas voters, including active duty military.",

Republicans are explicitly arguing that if the electoral system were not restrictive, exclusionary, and corrupt, then they would be put at an unfair disadvantage. What does that say about their party?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at one provision: automatic voter registration, in which people are registered to vote whenever they do something like get a driver\u2019s license, unless they choose to opt out. Today, 20 states plus D.C. have AVR. Most of them are run by Democrats, but not all; the heavily Republican states of Alaska and West Virginia have it as well.\n\nThe evidence is mixed, but while AVR clearly results in more people getting registered and more people voting, if there\u2019s any advantage for Democrats it\u2019s a small one, produced mostly by the fact that AVR registers many young people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have bothered.\n\nBut to argue against it, Republicans have to say that registering and voting should be difficult. In a pinch they can come up with some laughable elitist justification (If it\u2019s too easy, uninformed people will vote!), but most of the time they\u2019ll just say forthrightly that making registering and voting easier will help Democrats. Which means that making it harder helps Republicans.\n\nOr take gerrymandering, for which it is impossible to come up with even a remotely plausible justification. It\u2019s just about power: Our party has the power to draw lines that favor us, so we will.\n\nH.R. 1 doesn\u2019t give Democrats a \u201cthumb on the scale\u201d in redistricting, it would mandate that independent, nonpartisan commissions do the job. But Republicans cry that independence and nonpartisanship are unfair to them. They need gerrymandering, or else they\u2019ll be deprived of the advantage that allows them to win even when more voters prefer their opponents.\n\nSo viewed another way, Republicans are right: The creation of an even playing field would indeed disadvantage them relative to the status quo, because they\u2019ve successfully created an uneven playing field in so many states.\n\nA lawyer for the Arizona GOP basically admitted this at the Supreme Court this week. He was asked why the party was arguing that it\u2019s important to disqualify a legitimate voter\u2019s ballot if they mistakenly cast it in the wrong precinct. He replied that counting that vote would put Republicans \u201cat a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats,\u201d and added: \u201cPolitics is a zero-sum game.\u201d\n\nSo the Republican argument comes down to this: Only an unfair system is fair to us. Any attempt to make the system fair must therefore be stopped.\n\nWhen you hear them say that any electoral reform that makes voting easier is a plot to help Democrats, remember that that\u2019s what they mean. Nothing makes them more afraid than a well-functioning democracy. They aren\u2019t even pretending otherwise.",

[+] during the March Fourth rally calling\nfor a federal ban on assault weapons on July 13, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)  Getty Images  September 22 is not March Fourth. But that's the day that the March Fourth group will be holding another march in Washington, DC. March Fourth describes itself as a nonprofit, non-partisan advocacy group \u201cwith a singular mission: to federally ban assault weapons.\u201d So the September 22 March Fourth march will be a way to urge the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that was authored by Rep. David Cicilline (D-Rhode Island) and got through the U.S. House of Representatives as H.R. 1808 on July 29. This bill bears the name \u201cAssault Weapons Ban of 2022,\u201d and would make it \u201cunlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon.\u201d The emphasis here is on the word \u201cwould\u201d because the bill would need to get at least 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass.  That's why March Fourth has put forth the following tweet and video in advance of the march:  Now, it seems like the people in the video may have been using a little bit of sarcasm in what they were saying, perhaps? For example, there were the people saying things like \u201cI want to be fearful every time I'm in an open area in a public place,\u201d and, \u201cI want to think about how completely vulnerable I am while I am closing my eyes to pray at my place of worship,\u201d as well as, \u201cI enjoy practicing semi-annual lockdown drills with six year olds who don't fully understand what's happening.\u201d Then there was the guy who stated in a Michael Douglas-like voice, \u201cI like going to the movies and making a mental note of every exit in the theater to plan my escape,\u201d and the woman with the guitar dead-panning, \u201cI hope that our set is interrupted by loud percussive sounds that cause the audience to scream in horror and run for their lives.\u201d And what about the guy who declared, \u201cI want to think of this dumpster as hiding place for my kid,\u201d because what could be more delightful than a kid-in-a-dumpster?  Next, each of folks said that the freedom to experience each of those \u201cwonderful\u201d things were reasons not to march on September 22. Speaking of freedom, a man standing in front of an American flag in the video emphasized, \u201cI want to celebrate our nation's freedom by worrying that I'll end up bleeding out on the pavement while being trampled by terrified parade goers.\u201d The video then proceeded to display a collage of people chiming in with, \u201cI like that anyone can easily access weapons of destruction, weapons of war, designed to kill the greatest number of people in the least amount of time.\u201d The whole thing concluded with the words, \u201cOn September 22, we're marching at the U.S. Capitol to ban assault weapons,\u201d followed by the question \u201cwhy\u201d and the answer, \u201cThere's no good reason not to.\u201d  Yeah, it would kind of nice if all of the things mentioned in the video didn't actually happen recently. But hiding in dumpsters, bleeding on pavements, having to plan escapes, lockdown drills, and screaming in horror have become all to common in the U.S. That's led to repeated calls to do more than nothing, which, in turn, prompted Cicilline to draft H.R. 1808.  Uvalde and Highland Park mass shootings survivors, families and supporters rally on Capitol Hill in ... [+] Washington, DC, calling for stricter gun controls on July 13, 2022. (Photo by OLIVER CONTRERAS/AFP via Getty Images)  AFP via Getty Images  H.R. 1808 is not a completely new idea. In fact, from 1994 to 2004, our country actually had an assault weapons ban for ten years after being signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton. The law was allowed to lapse in 2004 and was never re-enacted, despite studies showing that mass shooting deaths had decreased during the ban. One such study was published in the American Journal of Surgery in 2022 while another was published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery in 2019 . These studies were completed even though the U.S. Congress has limited funding for gun violence research for over two decades, as I covered for Forbes in 2019  Scientific evidence may support the re-enactment of such a ban but you know how much political leaders listen to real science these days. The House vote H.R. 1808 was a bit of a political party in the U.S.A. situation. It fell largely along party lines with 217 mostly Democrats in favor and 213 mostly Republicans opposed. Only two Republicans and five Democrats crossed party lines in the vote. The bill now is in the hands of the U.S. Senate where it's most likely going to be doomed should a similar party divide be maintained. The Bill will need at least 60 votes to pass the Senate, which would mean at least 10 Republicans would have to vote for the bill.  So March Fourth may be facing an uphill march. Kitty Brandtner founded March Fourth two days following the after the mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois. That shooting left seven people dead and 48 others wounded. The shooter had used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 semiautomatic rifle with three 30-round magazines to fire 83 shots. Nine days after the shooting March Fourth held a march in Washington, DC, that included survivors from the Highland Park mass shooting as well as other mass shootings such as the one in Uvalde, Texas. Unfortunately, these days it's not difficult to find survivors and family members of victims of mass shootings in the U.S. Since then, members of March Fourth have been meeting with members of Congress and the White House to advocate for a ban on assault weapons.  America clearly has a gun violence problem, with already over 31,000 gun violence deaths in 2022 alone, according to the Gun Violence Archive . Healthcare researchers and professionals have been clamoring for more to be done about this continued bloodshed, as I reported for Forbes on August 2 . Again scientific studies have shown drops in mass shootings during the previous ten-year assault weapon ban while those opposed to such a ban have not really provided much scientific counter-evidence. One thing's for sure the U.S. can't really go forth with the current situation and expect gun violence to simply march away.",

Republicans often emerge as the villains who squash everything noble and good. Leftists are typically described as the \"reformers\" who somehow lack an ideology.\nTake a March 15 story that led the national section of The New York Times. The headline was \"For Voting Rights Advocates, a 'Once in a Generation Moment' Looms,\" with the subheading \"Opposition to restrictive Republican voting laws -- and support for a sweeping Democratic bill -- fuels a movement like none in decades. But can it succeed?\"\nLeftists are described as \"voting rights advocates\" who are having their \"moment.\" That's because Democrats are in control of everything; they have a \"sweeping\" proposal to fight those \"restrictive\" Republicans.\nYou can witness more of this careening tilt in the opening paragraph, written by supposedly objective reporters Nicholas Fandos and Michael Wines: \"State and national voting-rights advocates are waging the most consequential political struggle over access to the ballot since the civil rights era, a fight increasingly focused on a far-reaching federal overhaul of election rules in a last-ditch bid to offset a wave of voting restrictions sweeping Republican-controlled state legislatures.\"\nTIM SCOTT FIRES BACK AT LIBERAL MEDIA CRITICS OVER 'WOKE SUPREMACY' REMARK: LEFT HAS 'INTOLERANCE' FOR DISSENT\nSo, Republicans are pushing \"restrictions\" that can be slimed as curtailing \"access to the ballot,\" as happened during \"the civil rights era\" (ahem, \"racist\").\nThe reporters then laud the Democratic bill as a \"landmark national expansion of voting rights.\" Democrats often propose \"landmark\" legislation. That's part of how The New York Times and other outlets advertise -- less than subtly -- for Democrats.\nOut of 35 paragraphs in this story, the vast majority describe how \"advocacy groups\" such as Progress Arizona and Black Voters Matter are lobbying for the bill. President Joe Biden's \"got to have his Lyndon B. Johnson moment,\" the Black Voters Matter executive director says. (Republicans were again tagged as voter-repressing bigots.)\nNEWT GINGRICH: PELOSI, SCHUMER AND THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE VS. THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA\nOnly one paragraph features a Republican argument against H.R. 1: that the bill is a \"cynical attempt by the left to put their thumb on the scales of democracy and engineer our laws to help them win elections.\"\nThat quote was preceded by a warning not to believe the GOP: \"Republicans are still inflamed by Mr. Trump's false claims of a stolen election and the party's unified message that voting restrictions, many of which fall most heavily on minorities and Democratic-leaning voters, are needed to prevent fraud, which studies have repeatedly shown to barely exist.\"\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThese scribes don't apply the word \"controversial\" to H.R. 1. There are no polls cited to show where the voters land on the matter. A recent survey by the Honest Elections Project, for example, found that 77% of respondents believe voters should be required to show a photo ID when they vote. A McLaughlin  Associates poll found 81% support a photo ID requirement. H.R. 1 scraps that.\nThe McLaughlin poll also found 85% support for \"requiring signature verification for any mail-in ballot voting.\" H.R. 1 would ensure states could not enforce any witness signature or notarization requirement for mail-in voters.\nThe Times vaguely mentions \"the Republican voting agenda,\" saying that it included \"curbs on mail-in and early voting and stiffer voter ID requirements.\" They favor \"curbs\" and \"stiffer\" requirements, not ballot-integrity measures.\u00a0\nThis Times story doesn't really explain what's in this nearly 800-page bill. But it passes along the Democratic flatulence about \"the rollback of voting rights\" being \"an existential threat to the democracy on which all other liberal causes, from gun control to health care reform, depend.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIs this a \"rollback of voting rights\"? Or just the left's agenda?\n\"Repressive voting bills\" are supported by the majority of voters, but liberal journalists really don't care what the polls say.

The bill would also mandate that states offer mail-in ballots and same-day voter registration, which conservatives have long resisted in many states.\nThe House has passed the sweeping bill, but it has stalled in the Senate \u2014 Democrats need 60 votes to advance the legislation and Republicans have refused to sign on to H.R. 1, even filibustering the bill in June\u00a0 \u2014 fueled by opposition from former President Donald Trump, who has long propagated unsubstantiated claims of voting fraud.\nRead more: The ultimate White House org chart to 600+ members of Biden's staff and who makes six figures\nThe John Lewis Voting Act, named after the civil-rights icon and longtime Congressman who passed away last year, would notably restore federal pre-clearance requirements from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were weakened in the 2013 Supreme Court decision Shelby County v.

For decades, states and jurisdictions with histories of discrimination were required to obtain permission from the federal government before making voting changes or new legislative maps.\nThe legislation, which passed the House in a 219-212 party-line vote on Tuesday, faces an uncertain future in the Senate.\u00a0\nDemocratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama, who represents the cradle of the civil-rights movement, is the sponsor of H.R. 4 and invoked the legacy of Lewis in calling for passage of the bill.\n\"Here we are, marching to do our own work. As long as a Supreme Court is hellbent on rolling back voter rights, Selma is now,\" she said. \"As long as we have a Senate that is so entrenched with having a procedural vote called a filibuster and not restoring our voting rights, Selma is now.\"\nShe added: \"Old battles have become new again.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to weaken or eliminate the filibuster in order to pass voting-rights legislation, but they have steadfastly chosen to keep the practice in place, pointing to a need to preserve bipartisanship.\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the\u00a0organizers\u00a0of the\u00a0march, gave a rousing speech in support of voting rights \u2014 arguing that the filibuster could not stand in the way of progress.\n\"We will not sit by and allow you to filibuster our right to vote,\" he said. \"We paid too high a price. People died to give us the right to vote. People spent nights in jail to give us the right to vote. People lost their lives to give us to give us the right to vote.\"\nHe added: \"There is no filibuster that can stand in the way of a people determined to get their rights. That's why in the blistering heat, we came to Washington to say, 'You're not going to filibuster away our voting protections.'\"\nDespite the legislative setbacks, civil rights and labor leaders have called voting rights an extension of the ideals espoused by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\nOn Saturday, King's son, Martin Luther King III, spoke out forcefully for federal voting-rights legislation.\n\"We are a force of nature,\" he said. \"This is a battlefield of morals and you are armed with the truth and the truth is a flame, you cannot extinguish. People have done it before, and we'll do it again. We will demand federal voting rights until we have them. So don't give up. Don't give in. Don't give out. You are the dream, and this is our moment to make it true.\"\nDemocratic Rep. Mondaire Jones of New York, a first-term lawmaker who has called for the abolition of the filibuster and an expansion of the Supreme Court, warned the crowd of GOP rule if voting-rights legislation falls by the wayside.\n\"If we fail to act in this moment, we are on a path by which democracy dies in darkness,\" he said. \"Allow me to paint a future of that dark future for you. Thanks to partisan gerrymandering, the party of Donald Trump will take back control of the House next year, even as Democrats continue to win more votes nationwide.\"\nHe added: \"The party of Donald Trump would also take back the United States Senate through voter suppression in states like Georgia, and we gotta make sure that Raphael Warnock comes back to the Senate.\"\nOrganizers of the march also hoped to point to issues such as reparations for descendants of slavery, a $15 minimum wage, student loan debt cancelation, statehood for Washington, DC, and criminal justice reform, among other issues.",

The editorial did not say that, as things stand now, the bill to establish a commission and H.R. 1 and The Post's proposed bill are very unlikely to pass because of a Republican filibuster in the Senate.

But they should also use common sense: What will it take to achieve bipartisanship? Crucially, bipartisanship requires political parties that can tolerate internal disagreement. We often talk about whether 10 Republican senators would support a bill to overcome a filibuster.

That prospect is becoming more unlikely as the Republican Party increasingly squashes dissent.

    "body": "Biden issue an executive order to create a commission to study reparations for slavery.  The letter marks a change in strategy by advocates of reparations, who have long pushed for Congress to pass H.R. 40, a bill that would establish a commission to study reparations. In April 2021, the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance H.R. 40 for the first time since it was introduced in 1989.  Last June, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden supported a number of components of the bill. \u201cHe, of course, supports a study of reparations,\u201d Psaki said, \u201cand feels that would be the best next step.\u201d  But the push for a reparations commission has faced staunch opposition in the Senate. In 2019, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters he did not support reparations. \u201cI don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a Civil War, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We elected an African American president.\u201d  She sued her enslaver for reparations and won. Her descendants never knew.  The groups that signed the letter include the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America; the National Action Network, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton; the racial justice organization Color of Change; and the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch. The letter represents a recognition that unilateral executive action might be the only realistic path forward for reparations amid stalled progress in Congress.  A year after the Judiciary Committee vote, these activists say there is a growing urgency to establish a commission.  \u201cNow more than ever, we know that many of the racial disparities that weigh this country down, and divide people in the US from each other, are unnecessary and can be eradicated if we address the ongoing legacy of enslavement,\u201d says the letter, sent to the White House by email and Postal Service. \u201cBy righting our wrongs, we can make sure that all families in the US get a fair chance to acquire land, to buy a home, to enjoy good health, and to live without fear about tomorrow. That is why we write to request that you create by Juneteenth an expert commission like that which would be established by a bill in Congress, H.R. 40.\u201d  Advocates for a commission say that slavery drove the economy of the country, while the enslaved Black people were paid nothing for the forced labor. A commission would examine reparations not just for slavery, but also for the racial oppression that followed, including Jim Crow laws and black codes that denied Black Americans opportunities for education, housing and jobs.  More than 1,800 congressmen once enslaved Black people. This is who they were, and how they shaped the nation.  \u201cThe lack of moral and political will to begin the process of reparations continues to be a bloody stain on our collective identity and consciousness,\u201d said Dreisen Heath, a racial justice researcher at Human Rights Watch who testified about reparations before Congress last year. \u201cPresident Biden supports a study of reparations and can steer the country on a healthier, less destructive course by using his executive power to establish a federal reparations commission now.\u201d  The first reparations for enslaved Black people came in January 1865, after Maj. William Tecumseh Sherman's \u201cmarch to the sea\u201d shortly before the end of the Civil War. Sherman met with 20 Black ministers in Savannah, Ga., and asked how newly freed Black people could best survive economically after more than 200 years of enslavement and brutality.  \u201cThe way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it, and till it by our own labor \u2014 that is, by the labor of the woman and children and old men; and we can soon maintain ourselves and have something to spare,\u201d responded the Rev. Garrison Frazier, 67, who had purchased his freedom along with his wife's. \u201cWe want to be placed on land until we are able to buy it and make it our own.\u201d  Four days after Sherman's meeting with the ministers, he issued Special Field Order No. 15, seizing Confederate land along the coast from South Carolina to Florida. Sherman promised \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d for thousands of Black families, a move historians would later refer to as the first act of reparations for enslaved Black people.  More than 400,000 acres of land were seized, according to the Library of Congress. Families of formerly enslaved Black people would receive as many as 40 acres. The Army would lend them mules no longer in use.  But those reparations would not last long. The federal government soon reneged on its promise. On May 29, 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued an amnesty proclamation that gave the land back to White southerners who took a loyalty oath.  \u201cBy the latter part of 1865, thousands of freed people were abruptly evicted from land that had been distributed to them through Special Field Orders No. 15,\u201d the National Archives reported. \u201cWith the exception of a small number who had legal land titles, freed people were removed from the land as a result of President Johnson's restoration program.\u201d  Judge allows lawsuit by Tulsa Race Massacre survivors to proceed  Thousands of Black people were stripped of land and eventually forced into sharecropping and peonage.  In February, a coalition of more than 360 organizations sent a letter to Congress, urging it to \u201cimmediately bring\u201d H.R. 40 to the full House floor. The commission, the letter said, would resemble the panel that investigated the forced relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.  David Inoue, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, which signed the letter sent to Biden Wednesday, said there is significant support among the Japanese American community for reparations for enslavement of Black people.  \u201cFor those of us in the Japanese American community, redress happened for us close to 40 years ago,\u201d said Inoue, who testified in support of H.R. 40 before Congress last year. \u201cIt's as simple as passing a commission to research and investigate reparations. It is beguiling it has not happened at this point.\u201d  Inoue said he thinks the move to go directly to the executive branch is imperative because of the stalemate in the House and Senate.  \u201cIt's probably never going to happen that we will be able to move a [reparations] bill through the Senate,\u201d agreed Kenniss Henry, national co-chair for the legislative commission of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America,. \u201cThis is our moment.\u201d  It is still unclear what reparations would look like, but the commission would make proposals.  \u201cYou can never completely repair the harms,\u201d Henry said, \u201cbut you can make some major inroads. It is the same as trying to put a price on 256 years of forced free labor. You can create an algorithm to give you a ballpark figure.\u201d  Nkechi Taifa, director of the Reparations Education Project, which signed Wednesday's letter, said the federal government is lagging behind state and local jurisdictions that are moving ahead with reparations.  In 2019, the city council of Evanston, Ill., approved the first allocation of a reparations fund that would issue $400,000 in housing assistance to Black residents who lived in the city from 1919 to 1969 or were direct descendants of people harmed by discriminatory housing practices in this period.  The next year, California became the first state to establish a reparations task force. New York, New Jersey, Detroit, Providence, Asheville, N.C., and Wilmington, Del., have also established commissions to study reparations or introduced proposals.  \u201cWe have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\u201d said Taifa. \u201cWe are in control of the House, the Senate and the presidency. To let this opportunity wash away would be unconscionable for future generations.\u201d",

The speaker specifically said she would like Congress to pull out the section of H.R. 1, known as the For the People Act, that directs the Judicial Conference to issue a code of conduct for all justices and judges in the U.S. The House in January, but it stalled in the Senate due to opposition from Republicans and some Democrats.  Pelosi said she wants to that portion of the bill to get a hearing.  \u201cIn our H.R. 1. our bill to have cleaner government, we have called for the Supreme Court to have a code of ethics. They have no code of ethics. And really? It's the Supreme Court of the United States, they're making judgments about the air we breathe and everything else, and we don't even know what their ethical standard is?\u201d Pelosi said.  \u201cSo I would like to see that bill have a hearing. Not the whole bill, but taking out that piece, we've already passed the whole bill, but to focus on the Supreme Court ethics standard legislation,\u201d she added.

Pelosi on Thursday appeared to suggest that she thinks the justice should consider recusal.  \u201cPeople say from time to time well, it's a personal decision of a judge as to whether he should recuse himself.

States that already have such systems would have to update them to comply with the bill. The Honest Elections Project warned that rushing this could result in ineligible voters being registered.\nThe bill also requires same-day voter registration, which 29 states currently do not offer.\u00a0\nThe Honest Elections Project's report cited\u00a0problems that states have had with individual new systems in 2020. For example, it\u00a0pointed to how Iowa's use of a smartphone app during the\u00a0Democratic caucus led to delays in reporting the results and\u00a0the first use of same-day registration in Michigan led to long lines as officials struggled with the workload.\n20 STATE AGS DENOUNCE DEMOCRATS' HR1 AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nWashington Secretary of State Kim Wyman warned a House Administration subcommittee last week that\u00a0HR1 does not provide officials with enough time to properly put new systems in place\u00a0and that the bill makes it\u00a0\"problematic for election officials to be able to implement in the timelines prescribed.\"\nWashington is known for its progressive election laws, as it already has universal mail-in voting, but Wyman said even that state\u00a0would be hard-pressed to comply with HR1 in the time prescribed.\nFor example, she said\u00a0her state does not yet have a\u00a0facility to test\u00a0new standards for voting systems, and the\u00a0timeline set out for the 2022 midterm election is not practical.\n\"Our state wouldn't have a certified system because if you don't meet the standards and have your systems tested, they're decertified,\" Wyman said. \"That's a huge problem nationally.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nH.R. 1\u00a0passed\u00a0the\u00a0House of Representatives\u00a0by a vote of 220-210\u00a0in March. The Senate version of the bill is making its way\u00a0through the upper chamber.\u00a0\nDemocrats supporting the bill say\u00a0it improves access to ballots and prevents states from implementing rules that they argue are unfairly restrictive.\u00a0\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the bill would \"combat all of these voter suppression efforts by restoring critical parts of the Voting Rights Act... make it easier \u2014 not harder \u2014 to vote by automatically registering American voters when they get a driver\u2019s license... [and] limit dark money and corruption in our politics, and much more.\"\nThe Honest Elections Project, however, said the Democrats are expecting too much too soon\u00a0and it could result in turmoil.\n\"If H.R. 1 is adopted, voters across the nation\u2014and in states across the political spectrum\u2014would see their election systems upended,\" the report said. \"In their place would come strict mandates from Washington, novel voting systems, impossible deadlines, and the threat of costly lawsuits if and when states fail to implement them.\"\nFox News' Evie Fordham and Tyler Olson contributed to this report.",

    "body": "If Democrats fail to achieve the most significant parts of their agenda this term, Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) will be to blame. Both have opposed eliminating the filibuster, which would allow Democrats to pass bills with a simple majority vote. Manchin has gone further and said he would vote against the For the People Act (H.R. 1), which would offset new restrictions on voting passed at the state level by Republicans (he called the bill \u201cpartisan). Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right Manchin also has not said whether he would support President Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill, which can be passed through the reconciliation process, if Democrats stick together. He has raised objections about some tax increases, for example. With the narrowest of majorities in the Senate \u2014 a 50-50 split, with Vice President Harris the potential tiebreaking vote \u2014 Democrats cannot afford any defections. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Supporting your party's agenda when they need you is the bare minimum party leaders ask of their members, which is why \u201cHe's a Republican \u201d was trending on Twitter after Manchin declared his intention to oppose H.R. 1, and why there have been calls for liberals to run primary campaigns against both he and Sinema in the future. Manchin has been the subject of particular ire, especially after his opinion article last weekend criticizing the voting-rights bill. But it should be possible for Democrats to hold two thoughts at once about the West Virginia politician: First, what he is doing is lamentable, damaging to the party's goals. But second, his presence in the Senate is a gift to the Democratic Party. Having a Democratic senator in 2021 in a state like West Virginia \u2014 where neither Hillary Clinton nor Joe Biden could crack 30 percent of the vote \u2014 is a remarkable bit of good fortune Five myths about the filibuster Had Manchin not won reelection in 2018, his seat would be held by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. This is the Morrisey who joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit that sought to overturn the results in four states where Trump lost; so probably not, to put it mildly, someone whom Democrats could persuade to back the For the People Act. More importantly, all else remaining the same, had Morrisey won, Democrats would be in the minority in the Senate, and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) would be setting the body's agenda, as majority leader. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement But perhaps West Virginia needn't have chosen between Manchin and someone like Morrisey in the first place. What if Democrats ran and nominated someone more liberal, or at least more likely to vote with Democrats, in Manchin's next primary? Consider, however, that Manchin beat Morrisey with 49.6 percent of the vote to Morrisey's 46.3. This in a state where Biden got 29.7 percent of the presidential vote in 2020 and the Democratic challenger to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R.) that same year got 27 percent . There's no evidence that another Democrat could come anywhere close to Manchin's electoral performance. (Sinema is a slightly different story, given that Biden won her state; Arizona could plausibly elect a more mainstream Democrat than her. However, the other senator from Arizona, Mark Kelly (D.), is has a voting record similar to Sinema's.) Despite Biden's recent remark that Manchin and Sinema \u201cvote more with my Republican friends\u201d than with Democrats, that's not true (as a Washington Post Fact Checker analysis explained ): Both side with their party more often than they vote against it (although by not much). More importantly, they support Democrats for leadership positions. That leadership, in turn, helps shape the agenda. They aren't the most loyal Democrats, but they're more Democratic \u2014 obviously \u2014 than the Republicans who could replace them. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement How has Manchin managed to survive in a state that is so hostile to Democrats? He succeeds in part because he's not a typical modern Democrat. By most metrics, including analyses of voting patterns as well as perceptions by Democratic and Republican activists of ideology (something I and the University of Pennsylvania's Daniel Hopkins have measured ), he is the most conservative Democratic senator. Manchin has cultivated a reputation as a moderate and advertises his willingness to vote with the opposition on his website . He's built this reputation over the course of his career. But it is no longer so easy for a local politician to distance themselves from the national party. Manchin holds the same seat once held by Robert Byrd, the longest serving senator in United States history. Byrd was a Democrat, but one who filibustered civil rights legislation in the 1960s. What has changed is not West Virginia, but the political parties. In the middle of the last century, the most liberal politicians on racial issues were Democrats \u2014 but so too were the most conservative. West Virginia voters who might have been comfortable with those conservative Democrats are not so comfortable with the modern party. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Manchin's position is thus tricky. He needs to distance himself from a Democratic Party that has been slowly but steadily moving left \u2014 and not just on matters of race \u2014 for his entire political career. (Manchin is opposed to abortion, pro-gun rights, and has broken with his party on environmental issues, banking regulation and many other issues.) But as politics has become more nationalized, that's harder to do. This poses a problem for Democrats, especially party leaders. They really want Manchin to back the party's agenda, but they have little leverage to use against him. The party needs him and the seat he fills, more than he needs them. I took a vote that cost me my seat. I know what Joe Manchin is facing. It's not necessarily the end of the argument to say that he would likely lose his seat, and Democrats control of the Senate, if Manchin voted for the filibuster (and H.R. 1). Sometimes, it's worth it to sacrifice a seat for a policy goal. Democrats have done it before. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act was a Democratic priority, and the party backed it even though it cost them in that year's election. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement And H. R. 1 may even be more important than Obamacare was. Many worry that if the Republican voting restrictions stand, Democrats will be at a perpetual disadvantage in future elections. So for the good of the party in the long run, it may be worth it to trade the Senate seat from West Virginia for this policy victory. The catch is, that trade-off isn't one that Democratic leaders, let alone left-leaning pundits, are in a position to make. It's ultimately up to Manchin. What's more, we don't really know the senator's true preferences \u2014 he could be voting against H.R. 1 just to help his reelection chances, or because he sincerely thinks it's a bad, partisan bill. Some speculate Manchin will retire in 2024, anyway; he is 73. If that's his intent, he may feel more free to express his own preferences \u2014 whatever they may be \u2014 and there would also be no need for Democrats to defer to his electability. It's hard to say, however, how these shifting dynamics would change how he comes down on votes like H.R. 1 or the infrastructure package. If and when Manchin retires, some Democrats and pundits will no doubt rejoice. The leadership will be rid of a headache \u2014 but, almost certainly, the party will also be rid of a senate seat. And so the celebration may be short-lived. Today's Headlines The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.",

    "body": "But unknowns loom: What happens when agenda items that can be filibustered come to the fore? How seriously do Democrats take the need to pass sweeping democracy reforms, given that Republicans are entrenching anti-majoritarian tactics everywhere, which could help them win the House, crippling Biden\u2019s agenda? Won\u2019t that force the issue of filibuster reform?\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nOn MSNBC, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) floated a timetable to pass those democracy reforms, known as S. 1 and H.R. 1, potentially by August. Interviewer Mehdi Hasan noted that action on immigration, police reform and voting rights are all subject to the filibuster, and that the death of one Democratic senator could end their majority. Then this happened:\n\nHASAN: Time isn\u2019t on your side.\nSCHUMER: I agree we have to move quickly. I would say the deadline for S. 1 is \u2026 probably by August or so. We\u2019re consulting with experts. When is the latest that S. 1 can undo some of the despicable and frankly racist changes that some of these Republican legislatures have made?\n\nSchumer didn\u2019t commit to reforming the filibuster. But everyone knows passing S. 1 or even large swaths of it \u2014 especially ones blunting GOP voter suppression and extreme gerrymanders \u2014 won\u2019t pass without changing the filibuster or eliminating it.\n\nNow White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain has spoken positively of Schumer\u2019s declaration about a possible August deadline.\n\nOn a call with columnists, Klain was asked by yours truly how much urgency Biden sees in the need to pass democracy reforms and whether at some point it might be necessary to press Democratic holdouts against filibuster reform (like Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia) to take it more seriously.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocracy reform is very important \u2014 it\u2019s important to President Biden \u2014 it\u2019s important for our democracy, not just for the Democratic Party,\u201d Klain said. \u201cI heard Senator Schumer say last night on TV that his goal is to get H.R. 1 through the Senate this summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very strong goal, and one we would join him in pursuing,\u201d Klain continued. He added that the White House also hopes to see passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would restore voting rights protections gutted by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThis is a high priority for us,\u201d Klain said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work hard to try to get it passed.\u201d\n\nThis is consistent with previous White House statements in support of democracy reform, and it\u2019s good to hear this declaration of willingness to support Schumer\u2019s newly articulated timetable.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, Klain didn\u2019t say anything about filibuster reform. Biden recently told ABC News that he supports restoring the \u201ctalking filibuster,\u201d which would require a senator to actively keep the filibuster going. But it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019s willing to push Democrats further.\n\nKlain also emphasized, as the White House repeatedly has, that Biden still remains fully committed to trying to win bipartisan support for much of his agenda. Klain signaled optimism about the possibility of deals on infrastructure repair and police reform.\n\nBiden and Democrats have struck a difficult balance: They\u2019ve signaled real openness to Republican input on major Biden priorities, without getting dragged into efforts to dramatically whittle down their ambitions and chase bipartisan support that won\u2019t ever materialize.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nYet on voting rights and the filibuster, tough decisions will simply have to happen soon. There is no chance that democracy reform can get the support of 10 Republican senators to break a filibuster.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are rushing forward with voter suppression efforts everywhere, while openly threatening retribution against private corporations that dare to point it out. And Republicans are declaring that extreme gerrymanders could help them win back the House. Some experts think that could happen even if Democrats win the national House popular vote.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nSo at some point, Democrats will simply have to have a serious conversation about what this radicalization calls forth from them, not just for their own good but also for the good of our democracy and the country.",

It will take time to root out the disaffection, racism and misogyny that fuels so many of these senseless acts of violence,\" Obama said. \"But we can make it harder for those with hate in their hearts to buy weapons of war.\"\n\n\"We can overcome opposition by cowardly politicians and the pressure of a gun lobby that opposes any limit on the ability of anyone to assemble an arsenal. We can, and we must,\" he said.\n\nThe attack, which came days after another shooting rampage in Georgia that left eight dead, has renewed calls from lawmakers for federal gun control reform. During his time in the White House, Obama urged Congress to take up gun control legislation following several mass shootings around the country, though no significant congressional action was ever taken. The former president did issue a series of executive orders aimed at curbing gun violence following the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday called the shooting \"absolutely tragic,\" but ignored a question about the future of gun control during a swearing-in ceremony for William Burns as CIA director. Earlier this month, the House passed H.R. 8 that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales and H.R. 1146 to try and close what's known as the \"Charleston Loophole,\" which allows some firearms to be transferred by licensed gun dealers before the required background checks are completed.",

    "body": "'Hannity' hosts breaks down Democrats' double standard on allegations against New York Gov. Cuomo\n\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats are on the verge of passing sweeping campaign finance and voting rights reforms that would establish a new public financing system for certain\u00a0federal elections.\nThe\u00a0For the People Act of 2021, known as H.R. 1, is expected to clear the Democratic-led House later Wednesday. It\u00a0would provide public matching funds\u00a0for qualifying congressional\u00a0and presidential candidates at a rate of 6:1, among\u00a0many other provisions.\nThe 6:1\u00a0match would kick in for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200. For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400.\nThe program would begin in the 2028 election cycle and would\u00a0be voluntary. Candidates would opt in\u00a0by meeting donation qualifications and would be subject to certain contribution limits.\u00a0\nSQUAD AMENDMENT TO RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS TO FELONS, INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS FAILS IN HOUSE\nBackers of the bill say this small-dollar match program is the anecdote to getting big money and corporate interests out of elections and to allow candidates to focus on garnering support from their neighbors\u00a0rather than catering to high-dollar donor fundraisers and special interests.\n\"I'm very fond of saying\u00a0if we reduce the role of money in politics and increase the level of decency\u00a0and civility, we will be able to elect many more women, many more people of color, many more young people into elective office,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday.\u00a0\n\n      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n      \n\n\nThe public match program would be funded by a new 4.75%\u00a0surcharge on\u00a0criminal and civil penalties and settlements that corporations pay to the U.S. government. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated this week\u00a0the new revenue stream would generate about $3.2\u00a0billion over 10 years.\u00a0\nPRO-GOP GROUP TAKES AIM AT HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER MASSIVE ELECTION HR 1 REFORM BILL\nThe proceeds from these additional corporate settlement assessments would be deposited into a new \"Freedom From Influence Fund\" created under the legislation. This fund would bankroll the new small-dollar match program for congressional candidates, an\u00a0enhanced 6:1 campaign finance match program for presidential candidates, and a new pilot program that would incentivize\u00a0voters to make campaign donations.\nThe latter program, dubbed the My Voice Voucher Pilot Program, would be set up in three states and give voters vouchers worth $25 to donate to congressional candidates of their choice to encourage civic engagement. States would be reimbursed up to $10 million from the federal government for the voucher program.\u00a0\nHouse Republicans have panned the H.R. 1 legislation as a massive expansion of the federal government's\u00a0role in elections designed to pad politicians' campaign coffers.\u00a0In debate on the House floor, Republicans alleged the legislation would create a new taxpayer-funded system of election financing, though the funding stream for the \"Freedom From Influence Fund\" is not general taxpayer dollars.\nEVERY HOUSE DEMOCRAT SIGNS ONTO SWEEPING ELECTION REFORM BILL BLASTED BY GOP\n\"This bill isn't for the people, it's for the politicians,\" said\u00a0Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill.\nRep. August\u00a0Pfluger, R-Texas, said the legislation would \"fully cement the swamp.\"\n\"I'm particularly disturbed by the fact that if this bill passes, taxpayer dollars will be directly funneled to congressional candidates and campaigns,\" Pfluger said. \"The folks in my district ... absolutely do not approve of their hard-earned dollars paying for TV attack ads of any candidate, much less candidates\u00a0they don't support.\"\n\n      Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill.\n      \n\n\nHowever, the legislation doesn't authorize new general taxpayer dollars\u00a0for the public financing of elections, but rather is limited to the new assessments\u00a0applied to criminal and civil penalties on corporations and high-income tax scofflaws\u00a0that are found guilty of a crime by the federal government.\nCompanies that have paid such settlements in past include Facebook, Volkswagen and BP, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice.\u00a0\nHOUSE DEMS REVIVE 'FOR THE PEOPLE ACT' AIMED AT 'VOTER SUPPRESSION,' 'DARK MONEY,' AND GERRYMANDERING\n\"Let's be very clear, there is no public funding \u2013\u00a0use of taxpayer money \u2013\u00a0for congressional races in this legislation\u00a0no matter what you hear someone else [say],\" Pelosi said.\u00a0\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated\u00a0that the small-dollar match program for congressional candidates would cost $1.6 billion over 10 years, the presidential candidate match program would cost $905 million, and the new $25 pilot voucher program would cost $60 million. Overall the legislation would not further the national debt, but rather reduce the deficit by nearly $1 billion over a decade, the CBO found.\nOther provisions of H.R. 1 include\u00a0automatic voter registration, expanding\u00a0vote-by-mail and early voting, giving\u00a0felons the right to vote after serving their sentence, and\u00a0limiting the removal of names from voter rolls.\nThe legislation seeks to end partisan gerrymandering by requiring states to establish independent redistricting commissions. It would change the structure of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by having an odd number of commissioners in an effort to break partisan gridlock in enforcing campaign finance violations.\u00a0\nAnd H.R. 1 would also take aim at big-dollar donors and dark money in politics by requiring\u00a0additional disclosure of campaign donors and disclaimers on political advertising.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., acknowledged that Democrats are looking for generational changes in how elections are operated.\u00a0\n\"H.R. 1 would be the most consequential piece of voting rights legislation enacted since we passed the Help America Vote Act [in 2002],\" Hoyer said Tuesday.",

Together the trio is donating $4 million to Encircle, which in 2017 opened its first site in Provo where young people who identify as LGBTQ+ and their families can gather and receive support. \n \nThe donation will fund eight additional Encircle locations, including Reynolds\u2019 childhood home in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a full-circle moment for the musician, who has been a tireless advocate both for elevating LGBTQ+ rights and providing families\u2014particularly in the Mormon faith\u2014with avenues of conversation and connection.\n \nA new Gallup poll shows 5.6 percent of adults in the US identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. Four out of 10 LGBTQ youth across the country seriously consider suicide. The Encircle cites are located in communities with large Mormon populations; the church opposes same-sex marriage.\n \n \nReynolds started the LoveLoud foundation in 2017 to ignite conversations within the Mormon community about loving their LGBTQ+ youth. LoveLoud primarily focuses on gatherings at arts festivals around Utah in conjunction with local organizations.

    "body": "House Democrats have made election \u201creform\u201d their top legislative priority. House Resolution 1, styled the For the People Act, would vitiate existing state election laws, federalize the rules of congressional and presidential elections, and effectively do the same for state elections, which are often conducted on the same ballot. Critics have noted that the proposed rules are designed to benefit Democrats. They\u2019re also unconstitutional.\n\nThe key problem is that the Constitution doesn\u2019t give Congress the authority to regulate all federal elections in the same way. Congress has significant power over congressional elections. The Elections Clause of Article I, Section 4 provides that state legislatures \u201cshall prescribe\u201d the \u201ctimes, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,\u201d but also authorizes Congress to \u201cmake or alter such regulations.\u201d\n\nYet Congress has only limited authority over the conduct of presidential elections. They are governed by the Electors Clause in Article II, Section 1, which provides: \u201cCongress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.\u201d Congress\u2019s timing determination is binding on the states, as the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held last year in Carson v. Simon, which rejected Minnesota\u2019s modification of its ballot-receipt deadline. (The Honest Elections Project sponsored the litigation, and Mr. Rivkin was the plaintiffs\u2019 lead attorney.)\n\nBut the Electors Clause gives state legislatures plenary power over the manner of selecting presidential electors. It does not permit lawmakers to promulgate a comprehensive federal elections code. Nor does the 15th Amendment, which bars racial discrimination in voting, or the other amendments extending the franchise. Each grants Congress the power to enforce its guarantees through \u201cappropriate legislation.\u201d But as the Supreme Court explained in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), \u201cCongress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.\u201d None of these amendments guarantee the right to vote in any particular way\u2014such as by mail versus in person\u2014so Congress can\u2019t rightly be said to be enforcing them through H.R.1. And none of them repeal the Electors Clause.\n\nAlthough all 50 state legislatures have provided for popular election of presidential electors, the legislatures could change state law and appoint electors directly. H.R.1 violates the Electors Clause on its face, purporting to govern not merely the time, place and manner of congressional elections, but also regulating presidential elections in exactly the same prescriptive matter as congressional elections.",

    "body": "EXCLUSIVE: More than two dozen conservative organizations sent a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., urging Congress to work swiftly to pass sweeping energy legislation Republicans introduced this week.\n\nThe coalition of 27 groups, led by Americans for Prosperity (AFP), argued H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, would tackle inflation fueled by energy costs, characterizing it as the \"biggest challenge facing families and business.\" Overall, the legislation would boost domestic energy production while rolling back regulations and taxes, according to the letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Families and businesses are facing historic inflation costs driven by President Biden\u2019s war on American energy,\" AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Akash Chougule told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Now, Congress has a real opportunity to lower costs by repealing the onerous taxes and regulations that are standing in the way of an abundant, reliable energy supply.\"\n\n\"The Lower Energy Costs Act would unleash America\u2019s energy abundance by speeding up construction and energy production throughout this country,\" Chougule continued. \"We are calling on Congress to swiftly pass these bold reforms to lower costs for all Americans, and we will hold accountable those who stand in the way.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN\n\nIn the letter, AFP and the other groups \u2014 including America First Policy Institute, Heritage Action, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center for Energy & Environment, Americans for Tax Reform, Independent Women's Voice, the American Energy Alliance, Texas Public Policy Foundation and The Heartland Institute \u2014 touted a series of the legislation's provisions.\n\nFor example, it noted the bill would eliminate new taxes on natural gas infrastructure, ensure regular oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, eliminate permitting hurdles to pipeline development, streamline duplicative regulations related to natural gas production and bolster the ability for mining companies to establish a stronger U.S. critical mineral supply chain.\n\nREPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY RETRACT 'UNSERIOUS' COMMENTS PRAISING CHINA\n\nIndustry associations have repeatedly warned that the Biden administration's actions have made it harder for companies to produce on federal land while making the U.S. more dependent on foreign nations for both oil and important mineral resources required for various green energy technologies.\n\n\"Voters understand the need to move past the regulatory paralysis, burdensome taxes and wasteful spending holding back American energy abundance,\" the letter stated. \"With this bill, the House of Representatives has delivered. We urge swift passage and prompt consideration in the Senate. H.R. 1 would roll back the worst regulatory restrictions and taxes crippling supply chains for production and delivery of affordable energy.\"\n\n\"By removing these bottlenecks in the energy supply chain, the bill would help ensure abundant, affordable energy from diverse sources.\"\n\nThe conservative coalition also cheered the legislation's attempt to rein in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a broad law that requires federal agencies to review environmental impacts of projects before approval. However, cumbersome NEPA reviews take months and, often, years for relevant agencies to complete, delaying federal approvals for key projects.\n\nAnd the groups applauded Lower Energy Costs Act for rejecting \"green cronyism that caters to special interests at the expense of higher energy costs and deficits.\" They said in the letter that the bill rescinds about $30 billion in funding for green energy projects, ensuring Americans don't finance \"payoffs to activist groups and local power brokers.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Lower Energy Costs Act is an inflection point against the Biden administration\u2019s war on affordable energy that is fueling inflation and harming the environment by needlessly shifting energy production to higher impact countries and technologies,\" they concluded in the letter to McCarthy.\n\n\"We commend your attention to this challenge and commitment to lower costs through American energy abundance.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, several House Republican leaders including Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., introduced the legislation, saying it would address \"the energy crisis caused by President Biden\u2019s disastrous policies.\"\n\nMcCarthy said in a statement the bill \"will grow our economy, strengthen our national security, and ensure clean, affordable, American energy can power the world.\"",

    "body": "They involve the Founders' intent, retrocession to Maryland and the 23rd Amendment. But none stands up to scrutiny, as I'll discuss below. It's hard to accept that Republicans and other critics believe that these arcane constitutional claims count for more than respecting the nation's founding rallying cry of \u201cno taxation without representation.\u201d Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right Instead, as GOP leaders are increasingly willing to admit publicly, they care primarily about preventing the deep-blue District from sending two additional Democrats to the Senate and one to the House. Many of the objections raised at last week's House hearing on statehood were plainly laughable. A bill, H.R. 51, would convert all but a sliver of the District to a new state. Zack Smith, a legal fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation, marred an otherwise responsible presentation by asserting that D.C. residents already had plenty of influence on Capitol Hill because they could post yard signs that members of Congress would see on their way to work. Bowser, advocates make the case for D.C. statehood at House committee hearing. So me GOP House members suggested the District couldn't be a \u201creal\u201d state because it lacked a landfill or a sufficient number of car dealerships. One of their principal complaints \u2014 that statehood represents a partisan power grab by Democrats \u2014 was risible in light of U.S. history. Admission of states has often provoked major political battles, as well as constitutional challenges. The Republicans have brought in many states for their own partisan purposes. In one of the best examples, the GOP successfully lobbied to split the Dakota Territory into two states in 1889 so the GOP would pick up four new senators instead of two. \u201cWestern states that were brought in in the late 19th century \u2014 Colorado, the Dakotas \u2014 were not only brought in on a party-line vote, but they were brought in specifically with the purpose to pad Republican majorities,\u201d said George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at UMBC and co-author of \u201cChocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital.\u201d That said, the Republicans did raise some arguments that merit attention, even if they ultimately come up short: \u25cf Founders' intent. It's fair to ask whether the Constitution's authors foresaw shrinking the federal district to a two-mile square enclave comprising the White House, Capitol, Supreme Court and the Mall. Could D.C. become a state? Explaining the hurdles to statehood. That's what H.R. 51 would do, to honor the Constitution's requirement that the seat of government would be in a federal district controlled by Congress and \u201cnot exceeding ten miles square.\u201d The rest of the current District would become the 51st state. Critics say the risk is that the shrunken district would be too small to carry out its intended functions, especially providing security for Congress. That argument lost a lot of punch, however, with the police response to the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by rioters intent on blocking the election of President Biden. The Capitol Police called in reinforcements not just from the District, but also from Maryland and Virginia. If the Capitol Police can call in reinforcements from Maryland and Virginia, then why not from a newly created neighboring state as well? The bottom line is that the Founders put nothing in the Constitution's text to prohibit the shrinkage of the federal district. \u201cThere's no lower bound in there,\u201d said Adriel I. Cepeda Derieux, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIf they knew how to say it couldn't be larger than a certain size, they were also smart enough to say it couldn't be smaller than a certain size, and they didn't.\u201d \u25cf Retrocession. The alternative of giving most of the District back to Maryland has the distinct advantage of solving the main problem by providing the District's 712,000 citizens with congressional representation. A s such, it's been the favored alternative for Republicans and others who could tolerate seeing the Democrats pick up an extra House member as long as they didn't get two more senators as well. \u2018It's not a local issue anymore': D.C. statehood moves from political fringe to the center of the national Democratic agenda. There's also a precedent for it. The District originally straddled both sides of the Potomac, but the land on the Virginia side retroceded to the Old Dominion in 1847. But there's a huge difference today. The Virginia retrocession occurred with the approval of both the affected residents at the time \u2014 living in what is now the city of Alexandria and Arlington County \u2014 and the Richmond legislature. (Both supported it largely to protect slavery against rising abolitionist sentiment across the river, but that's a separate story.) The opposite is true now. District residents don't want to rejoin Maryland. They voted by 86 percent in a referendum endorsing statehood. Maryland isn't supportive either. A Washington Post poll in 2019 found Marylanders opposed making the District one of their counties by 57 percent to 36 percent. \u201cThe question of retrocession is an irrelevant distraction when the people of Washington have already written a state constitution and petitioned to join the union as their own state,\u201d Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) said. \u25cf 23rd Amendment. The 1961 amendment granting the District three electoral votes raises perhaps the thorniest objections of all. That's because it would provide that a shrunken federal district \u2014 home to the occupants of the White House and maybe no one else \u2014 would still cast votes for the president. Even the ACLU, which supports statehood, acknowledged in a report that there is \u201cdiscernible tension\u201d between the 23rd Amendment and H.R. 51. The statehood bill aims to solve it first by repealing the legislation in which Congress provides for the District's participation in federal elections. The amendment's second section gives Congress that authority. In theory, this means the shrunken district wouldn't select any electors. But that would seem to conflict with the amendment's first section, which says the federal district \u201cshall appoint\u201d electors. It says the district shall do so \u201cin such manner as Congress may direct.\u201d But the language doesn't appear to allow that no electors would be appointed at all. H.R. 51 also provides for initiation of speedy congressional approval to repeal the 23rd Amendment. Statehood defenders say both chambers would quickly repeal it, as would at least 38 state legislatures as required to amend the Constitution. That's because Democrats would want to support statehood, and Republicans wouldn't want the Biden family to be able to cast three electoral votes. But there's no guarantee the amendment would be repealed that quickly. It's conceivable that Republican state legislatures would refuse to do so while statehood opponents mounted efforts in the courts to block H.R. 51 altogether. I think the best solution is to press for repeal but meanwhile have Congress direct the shrunken district's electoral votes be cast according to the nationwide popular vote \u2014 two electoral votes for the winner and one for the loser. Moves to render the 23rd Amendment inoperative until its repeal would be \u201cuntidy\u201d but still constitutional, the ACLU report said. They would provide a path to correct one of America's most glaring failures to live up to its ideal of representative government.

    "body": "It is \u201cunconstitutional, reckless, and anti-democratic,\u201d former vice president Mike Pence proclaimed . The bill is \u201cthe most divisive, unconstitutional and destructive piece of legislation of my time in Congress,\u201d Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr (R-Ky.) railed . \u201cIt would effectively make it legal to cheat.\u201d The bill that has these politicians frothing is H.R. 1, a long piece of legislation with a noble purpose: making it easier for Americans to vote and encouraging the government to be more responsive to the people. Republicans' apocalyptic rhetoric is so wildly disproportionate to the contents of the bill, one must wonder what they are really worried about. Conservatives complain that the bill would mandate early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, provisional ballots for people who accidentally vote out-of-precinct, same-day voter registration and automatic voter registration. So? There is nothing scary or even unusual about these reforms, which many states have embraced without seeing the pervasive fraud Republicans predict and claim falsely has occurred. Opponents argue that counting mail-in ballots that arrive in the days after Election Day, as long as they are mailed on time, would produce uncertainty about the results on election night. Big deal. It is far more important to count Americans' votes, even if the U.S. Postal Service delays their delivery, than it is to soothe impatient election night viewers. Critics also warn that state legislatures would have to turn over congressional district map-drawing to independent commissions. And? Extreme partisan gerrymandering makes the need for nonpartisan redistricting, which has worked in state after state that has tried it, more acute. There is more to the bill, including an innovative campaign finance reform that would boost the power of small donors. If Republicans simply objected to that section, or a controversial provision on absentee ballot collection, or a requirement for an ethics code for Supreme Court justices, their position would be more defensible. But they seem to attack with greatest ferocity the provisions that should be least controversial: those that would encourage more Americans to vote. In his screed against H.R. 1 , Mr. Pence claimed that the last election was marked by \u201csignificant voting irregularities\u201d and that \u201cit is time for our nation's leaders to help America heal.\u201d In fact, there were no significant irregularities, and healing is needed only because Mr. Pence and his boss lied about that, and now they are fanning unjustified fears about the supposed dangers of policies that would ease voting. Then they profess alarm that half the country mistrusts the electoral system, and they insist that the only remedy is to preserve and enhance barriers to the ballot box, restrictions that \u2014 surprise! \u2014 would discourage turnout especially among Democratic voters. H.R. 1 now moves to the Senate. If Republicans there object to elements of the bill, they should seek to amend it. If they reject the effort out of hand, it will be yet another sign that they have embraced a strategy of voter suppression because they fear that, if the rules are fair, they will lose.

Dick Durbin\u2019s] years-long effort and championing this effort,\u201d Mayorkas said.\n\nMayorkas also suggested that the role of DHS, under his and President Joe Biden\u2019s direction, is \u201cto\u00a0build safe and legal pathways for people\u201d to stay in the U.S. indefinitely \u2014 a stark contrast to former President Trump\u2019s DHS, which sought to stem illegal immigration and drug trafficking.\n\nThe amnesty push by Mayorkas comes as Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) has said he is crafting amnesty legislation that would be sent off to Senate Democrats for negotiating.\n\nIn March, the Democrat-controlled House \u2014 with support from\u00a030 House Republicans\u00a0\u2014 passed H.R. 1603, known as the \u201cFarm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021,\u201d and H.R. 6, known as \u201cAmerican Dream and Promise Act of 2021.\u201d\n\nTogether, the two plans would give amnesty to about\u00a02.1 million\u00a0illegal aliens working on U.S. farms and another\u00a04.4 million\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)-enrolled and eligible illegal aliens and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS).\n\nAlready, many Senate Democrats\u00a0are seeking\u00a0to slip an amnesty past Congress through a little-known \u201creconciliation\u201d maneuver. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is crafting a proposal that would include forcing American taxpayers to\u00a0spend $150 billion\u00a0on providing amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.\n\nAn amnesty would come as nearly\u00a016 million\u00a0remain jobless, all of whom want full-time jobs. Another 5.3 million Americans are underemployed but likewise, want full-time employment.\n\nAn analysis released this week by the Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0revealed that amnesty\u00a0for illegal aliens, which would immediately flood the U.S. labor market with millions of newly legalized foreign workers for whom employers can legally hire, would have a devastating impact on the nation\u2019s ongoing unemployment problem.\n\nEvery year, 1.2 million legal immigrants are given green cards to permanently resettle in the U.S. In addition, 1.4 million foreign nationals are given visas to take American jobs while hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens enter the U.S. annually.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

    "body": "By Larry Keane\n U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah) took to the floor of the House of Representatives with a reminder to the politicians pushing gun control. Those proposals have their roots in a racist past and it only serves to further victimize disaffected communities.\n In 2020, African Americans led the historic gun-buying surge, taking self-protection into their own hands by buying firearms at a rate\u00a058 percent higher\u00a0than they did in 2019.\n All told more than\u00a021\u00a0million\u00a0background checks for the sale of a gun were processed by the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), including more than 8.4 million first-time buyers. While Democrats push to institute more gun restrictions, Americans\u2019 appetite for gun control dropped to the\u00a0lowest\u00a0levels in years.\n   History Lesson\n In opposing the bills,\u00a0H.R.\u00a08\u00a0and\u00a0H.R. 1446, Rep. Owens said he received thousands of constituent emails and calls urging a \u201cNO\u201d vote.\n \u201cI absolutely will fight these measures with every tool in my grasp,\u201d he said. \u201cThese rights protect my life, liberty and property, were granted to me by God and cannot be taken away from me by D.C. bureaucrats!\u201d\n Rep. Owens\u2019 comments got personal.\n \u201cI grew up in the deep South at a time when African Americans were unable to defend themselves. After the Civil War, Black Codes and Jim Crow laws prohibited people of color from owning firearms,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs a child my father witnessed an altercation between his father and a Southern white man who thought my grandfather was being disrespectful and threatened to teach him a lesson. But my grandfather was prepared\u2026without firing his gun on another human being, my grandfather\u2019s rights to own a firearm ensured his rights to protect his life, liberty and property.\u201d\n \n Take Ownership\n In 2020 the coronavirus pandemic coupled with community violence, riots and looting was widespread in America. Police were stretched thin, criminals were\u00a0released\u00a0from jails and calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d rang out. Law-abiding Americans saw danger in front of them and acted by purchasing firearms. Black Americans were among them, for good reasons.\n Danielle Campbell, an African American mother in Florida, didn\u2019t like what she saw and bought a gun. \u201cA lot of us are single mothers\u2026We\u2019re learning that we can protect ourselves; we don\u2019t have to be victims,\u201d Campbell\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cI decided I needed to take the safety and security of my family into my own hands.\u201d\n Another African American mother, Trish Wendt of Pittsburgh, left a local gun show with new purchases. \u201cI have one for home defense and one for carrying. I have kids and we\u2019re alone a lot, and it\u2019s my responsibility to protect my children,\u201d Wendt\u00a0explained.\n President and Founder of the National African American Gun Association Philip Smith knows these developments\u00a0firsthand.\u00a0The NAAGA saw membership grow by 2,000 each day at points during 2020, their normal yearly new membership total.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a trend of more African Americans choosing to express their Second Amendment rights to own a firearm, especially for personal protection.\u201d\n Black Guns Matter Founder Maj Toure summed up why he is\u00a0laser-focused\u00a0on promoting Black gun ownership, gun education and safety. Of the African American community, he says, \u201cPeople somehow forget that we have the right to defend our lives with firearms\u2026I pick my words very carefully: All gun control is racist.\u201d\n Attempted Point. Definitive Counterpoints.\n Back in Washington, D.C., U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has voiced support for gun control efforts before and will likely support current efforts in the U.S. Senate. Sen. Booker\u00a0tweeted,\u00a0\u201cIf you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and possess a gun.\u201d\n His counterpart across the aisle, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.),\u00a0disagrees, \u201cThe Second Amendment is fundamental to ensuring freedom and democracy and it should not be infringed upon.\u201d\n Rep. Owens\u2019 House colleague Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) also came out\u00a0swinging\u00a0against the antigun bills.\n \u201cDemocrats in Washington, D.C., are trying to infringe upon your Second Amendment as we speak with H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446,\u201d Rep. Donalds said. \u00a0\u201cI will always stand up for law-abiding citizens\u2019 right to keep and bear arms because I know gun laws only impact law-abiding citizens, not criminals.\u201d\n As President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and Congressional Democrats continue their attempts at increased gun control, law-abiding Americans of all stripes and backgrounds will continue taking their safety and security into their own hands. This includes Black gun owners. The Second Amendment is an American right for all.\n                               Larry Keane is Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs and General Counsel for the\u00a0National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association.",

    "body": "Joe Manchin III's proposed voting rights compromise : It's overall a good proposal. And it requires only two slight changes to merit Republican support. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right Democrats have thus far made support for their far-reaching election bill, H.R. 1 , a matter of party dogma. That measure would essentially federalize election law and create the least secure voting system anywhere in the developed world. Democrats may say there's nothing to worry about in a system that essentially has no prior checks on voter eligibility and provides no serious barriers to voter fraud. The fact that voter fraud rarely happens doesn't mean it never does. H.R. 1's approach to election law is akin to a bank president saying the bank no longer needs vaults because no one has ever broken into them. Manchin's opposition to this unnecessary proposal earned him a lot of progressive scorn, but the West Virginia Democrat rose to the moment this week by producing a much-scaled-down set of principles that Republicans could endorse. He would make Election Day a public holiday and mandate 15 days of continuous early voting in federal elections. He would also require automatic voter registration for people with driver's licenses, although he would allow people to opt out of registration if they didn't want to appear on the rolls. And he would require voters to show identification when they arrive at the polls and ban partisan gerrymandering. Each of these ideas would marginally increase voter turnout without giving license to fraud. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement What Manchin doesn't include is as important as what he does. His idea does not sanction nationwide, no-excuse mail balloting, as H.R. 1 would. There's no requirement for states to create stand-alone drop boxes where voters can submit ballots without direct personal supervision by election officials. There's no ban on states adopting identification measures for people who ask to vote by mail. And there's no provision legalizing third-party handling of ballots, something Republicans call \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d Each of these measures would have opened the door for enterprising fraudsters; keeping them out of his proposal shows Manchin takes election integrity seriously. His proposed changes to the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act also demonstrate that Manchin is serious about keeping election law from becoming a partisan football. His ideas on the bill, which would reauthorize the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, are not as fleshed out, but in general they limit an attorney general or partisan-allied lawyers' groups from using the law to coerce states and localities to agree to voting rules that advantage one side and that aren't approved by elected representatives. He would also require an objective test to determine whether a state or locality has a pattern of election discrimination that might warrant additional federal oversight. This principle recognizes that the days of Jim Crow are over, and that any arguments we have about voting access address marginal, not significant, barriers to voting. Abrams's endorsement is surprising given how the Georgia Democrat has made crusading for progressive visions of voting access her calling card. But it may be a welcome \u2014 if perhaps belated \u2014 recognition that most Americans don't share her views. Polls regularly show that even Democrats and Black Americans approve of voter-identification laws, and it's increasingly hard to say anyone is denied the right to vote when there are so many ways to cast a ballot at one's convenience. Her endorsement could help bring progressives on board. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Republicans should endorse this, too, with some amendments. The automatic voter registration requirement should include a provision that ensures only citizens can be registered, which probably requires some sort of measure that ensures driver's license applicants provide a Social Security number whose validity can be checked against the federal government's E-Verify platform. The voter-ID component should also require a person who relies on an alternative identification measure that does not contain a picture ID to submit to having their photo taken upon voting. That photograph can then be attached to their voter file so that no one can subsequently impersonate them, and so election officials can verify their identity visually in future elections. Done right, early in-person and mail voting can improve voter access without seriously risking election integrity. Manchin's ideas largely do that and could be a way to restore faith in our sorely tested democratic norms.

    "body": "'Congress has a real opportunity to lower costs,' Americans for Prosperity vice president tells Fox News Digital\n close\n  More than two dozen conservative organizations sent a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., urging Congress to work swiftly to pass sweeping energy legislation Republicans introduced this week.\n  The coalition of 27 groups, led by Americans for Prosperity (AFP), argued H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, would tackle inflation fueled by energy costs , characterizing it as the \"biggest challenge facing families and business.\" Overall, the legislation would boost domestic energy production while rolling back regulations and taxes, according to the letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital.\n  \"Families and businesses are facing historic inflation costs driven by President Biden's war on American energy,\" AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Akash Chougule told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Now, Congress has a real opportunity to lower costs by repealing the onerous taxes and regulations that are standing in the way of an abundant, reliable energy supply.\"\n  \"The Lower Energy Costs Act would unleash America's energy abundance by speeding up construction and energy production throughout this country,\" Chougule continued. \"We are calling on Congress to swiftly pass these bold reforms to lower costs for all Americans, and we will hold accountable those who stand in the way.\"\n  In the letter, AFP and the other groups \u2014 including America First Policy Institute, Heritage Action, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center for Energy & Environment, Americans for Tax Reform, Independent Women's Voice, the American Energy Alliance, Texas Public Policy Foundation and The Heartland Institute \u2014 touted a series of the legislation's provisions.\n  For example, it noted the bill would eliminate new taxes on natural gas infrastructure, ensure regular oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, eliminate permitting hurdles to pipeline development, streamline duplicative regulations related to natural gas production and bolster the ability for mining companies to establish a stronger U.S. critical mineral supply chain.\n  Industry associations have repeatedly warned that the Biden administration's actions have made it harder for companies to produce on federal land while making the U.S. more dependent on foreign nations for both oil and important mineral resources required for various green energy technologies.\n  \"Voters understand the need to move past the regulatory paralysis, burdensome taxes and wasteful spending holding back American energy abundance,\" the letter stated. \"With this bill, the House of Representatives has delivered. We urge swift passage and prompt consideration in the Senate. H.R. 1 would roll back the worst regulatory restrictions and taxes crippling supply chains for production and delivery of affordable energy.\"\n  \"By removing these bottlenecks in the energy supply chain, the bill would help ensure abundant, affordable energy from diverse sources.\"\n  The conservative coalition also cheered the legislation's attempt to rein in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a broad law that requires federal agencies to review environmental impacts of projects before approval. However, cumbersome NEPA reviews take months and, often, years for relevant agencies to complete, delaying federal approvals for key projects.\n  And the groups applauded Lower Energy Costs Act for rejecting \" green cronyism that caters to special interests at the expense of higher energy costs and deficits.\" They said in the letter that the bill rescinds about $30 billion in funding for green energy projects, ensuring Americans don't finance \"payoffs to activist groups and local power brokers.\"\n  \"The Lower Energy Costs Act is an inflection point against the Biden administration's war on affordable energy that is fueling inflation and harming the environment by needlessly shifting energy production to higher impact countries and technologies,\" they concluded in the letter to McCarthy.\n  \"We commend your attention to this challenge and commitment to lower costs through American energy abundance.\"\n  On Tuesday, several House Republican leaders including Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., introduced the legislation , saying it would address \"the energy crisis caused by President Biden's disastrous policies.\"\n  McCarthy said in a statement the bill \"will grow our economy, strengthen our national security, and ensure clean, affordable, American energy can power the world.\"\n  Thomas Catenacci is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "body": "The House will soon vote on a Democrat bill that would cap the price of insulin, which is viewed by Republicans as a cynical ploy to boost Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s (D-GA) reelection chances.\n\nThe House will reportedly vote on H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now Act, on Thursday. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), would cap the cost-sharing under private health insurance for a month\u2019s supply of insulin at $35 or 25 percent of the plan\u2019s negotiated price starting in 2023. The bill would also cap the cost of insulin under Medicare to $35 or 25 percent of the plan\u2019s negotiated price.\n\nThe bill is co-sponsored by 34 Senate Democrats, and not one Republican has backed the bill.\n\nA Republican aide told Breitbart News that this legislation serves nothing more than a cynical attempt to help reelect Warnock.\n\nThe aide said, \u201cThis is a cheap bumper sticker slogan to try to get Warnock elected, not a serious solution to a serious problem.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican leadership recommended a vote against the legislation, contending that it would expand government control over Americans\u2019 health care and result in less access to life-saving treatments.\n\nHouse Republican leadership issued a leadership recommendation on Wednesday, urging Republicans to oppose the bill, explaining:\n\nLeadership recommends a NO vote. Affordable Insulin Now Act\n\n Instead of working in a bipartisan way to address the root causes of high out-of-pocket costs for insulin, Democrats are reviving their price control agenda by mandating Part D plans and private insurers cover selected insulin products at a government-imposed price cap of the lesser of $35/month or 25 percent of the negotiated price.\u00a0 This approach, like H.R. 3 and provisions included in Build Back Better (BBB), is another attempt to expand government control over patients\u2019 health care.\u00a0 Government control and price controls will result in fewer cures and less access for Americans to doctors and drugs \u2013 including life-saving treatments.\n\n \u2022 This provision was included in the Democrats\u2019 failed BBB and represents the largest expansion of federal command and control in Americans\u2019 private health insurance design since Obamacare.\n\n \u2022 Allows manufacturers to raise the prices of insulin without scrutiny, leading to higher costs for patients through increased premiums and higher cost-sharing on insulin products that are not price controlled by the bill.\n\n \u2022 CBO estimates the legislation would increase costs by about $11 billion and the bill uses a budget gimmick to offset the cost by delaying the Trump Administration\u2019s rebate rule for one additional year.\n\n \u2022 Fails to reform the convoluted rebate system so patients will continue to pay higher prices on all other drugs at the pharmacy counter.\n\n \u2022 Republicans have introduced a bipartisan alternative, H.R. 19, which would lower all prescription drug costs, including insulin, and cap all seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket spending on drugs while ensuring America continues to lead the world in innovation and access to cures and treatments.\n\nA Republican Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means Committee joint messaging document obtained by Breitbart News said the bill relies on budget gimmicks and would raise costs through increased premiums and higher cost-sharing:\n\nSeveral healthcare and conservative organizations, including the ERISA Industry Committee, National Federation of Independent Businesses, Freedomworks, Americans for Tax Reform, Americans for Prosperity, National Taxpayers Union, Association of Mature American Citizens, Heritage Action for America, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, and the Partnership for Employer-Sponsored Coverage, oppose the bill.\n\nIf Congress mandates government price controls for insulin, they will be stifling research, reducing the creation and availability of life-saving insulin formulations, and inserting government between patients and their doctors. Instead, Congress should pursue effective free-market reforms to reduce the price of prescriptions for\u00a0all\u00a0Americans. The answer to high drug prices is less government overreach, not more. In a competitive free market unburdened by unnecessary FDA regulation, insulin prices could be a fraction of their current cost. It\u2019s up to Congress to get out of the way.\n\nFreedomWorks President Adam Brandon said in a key vote alert about the bill:\n\nWhile progressives are all too eager to blame high prices on \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d the reality is that this is an issue created by the federal government. Heavy-handed price controls are a deeply flawed solution that misses the mark when identifying the problem. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play a significant role in the dramatic rise in the cost of prescription drugs. PBMs are third-party administrators determining which drugs go on formularies (a list of approved prescription drugs that hospitals can prescribe and are covered under an insurance policy). Ostensibly, PBMs negotiate to obtain the best price. However, these \u201csavings\u201d are often pocketed by PBMs themselves and aren\u2019t passed onto patients. Since they are reimbursed based on the markdown from the original list price, PBMs are incentivized to prioritize drugs with higher list prices, so they can receive a larger markdown.\n\n\u201cThis legislation is a simplistic proposal to address a highly complex problem. We cannot afford half-hearted proposals based on unsound economics like this one for an issue that impacts so many,\u201d Brandon added.",

More than 70,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. involved fentanyl in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Fentanyl is the leading cause of death among adults ages 18-45. It impacts nearly every community in every state.\n  Fentanyl-related deaths are arguably the most important issue the country faces right now. Shatterproof is grateful that the President made this a centerpiece of his speech, and that Congress is holding hearings to urgently address this crisis.\n  Shatterproof is a national organization focused on guiding communities, removing systemic barriers to recovery, mobilizing the country to advocate for change, and ending addiction stigma. Shatterproof is doubling down on its efforts to address the harm caused by fentanyl. In the states, Shatterproof is advocating for legislation that aims to address the fentanyl crisis in a comprehensive way \u2014 by tackling key challenges such as overdose reporting and data sharing among public health and public safety, improving naloxone access and related good Samaritan laws, ensuring prevention programming helps communities address fentanyl challenges in the state, and encouraging state leaders to study and track the use of the internet for fentanyl trafficking. States should also invest in scalable education campaigns to prevent drug use and fentanyl-related deaths.\n  President Biden also highlighted an effort to increase inspection capacity of cargo vehicles. Shatterproof has advocated for The Fentanyl Sanctions Act (H.R. 2483/ S. 1044) to make trafficking fentanyl to the U.S. more difficult. Shatterproof also supported the STOP Act, which will upgrade postal service resources and education on fentanyl coming into the country. These laws should be vigorously implemented.",

    "body": "meant to guarantee voting rights and fight political corruption. Naturally, Republicans are outraged. The response of most Democrats is to dismiss Republican objections as bad faith and part of their sweeping war on democracy meant to undermine voting rights so they can win and hold power despite having the support of a minority of the public. Which is perfectly true. But let's take the Republican objection to H.R. 1's provisions seriously. Because when you do, it makes their opposition look even less defensible. That objection was summarized by former vice president Mike Pence in a recent column Every single proposed change in HR 1 serves one goal, and one goal only: to give leftists a permanent, unfair, and unconstitutional advantage in our political system. We hear this from Republicans at all levels; as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said , \u201cIt is not designed to protect Americans' vote \u2014 it is designed to put a thumb on the scale in every election in America, so that Democrats can turn a temporary majority into permanent control.\u201d Here are some of H.R. 1's key provisions: Requires automatic voter registration Requires reasonably generous early voting Requires no-excuse absentee voting, or vote by mail Mandates independent commissions to draw congressional districts to end partisan gerrymandering Limits voter purges Restores voting rights to those with felony convictions Establishes public financing for federal campaigns in which small donations would be matched Restricts \u201cdark money\u201d Requires presidents and presidential candidates to release their tax returns We could argue about the particulars of each of these, but let's consider them in light of the Republican objection: that they must not be allowed, because they would help Democrats. What they're saying is that early voting \u2014 which many people find convenient \u2014 helps Democrats. Eliminating gerrymandering would help Democrats. Limiting states' ability to throw thousands of people off the voter rolls en masse would help Democrats. Restricting dark money would help Democrats. If we saw every presidential nominee's tax returns, it would help Democrats. Getting the picture? Republicans are explicitly arguing that if the electoral system were not restrictive, exclusionary, and corrupt, then they would be put at an unfair disadvantage. What does that say about their party? Let's take a closer look at one provision: automatic voter registration, in which people are registered to vote whenever they do something like get a driver's license, unless they choose to opt out. Today, 20 states plus D.C. have AVR. Most of them are run by Democrats, but not all; the heavily Republican states of Alaska and West Virginia have it as well. The evidence is mixed , but while AVR clearly results in more people getting registered and more people voting, if there's any advantage for Democrats it's a small one, produced mostly by the fact that AVR registers many young people who otherwise wouldn't have bothered. But to argue against it, Republicans have to say that registering and voting should be difficult . In a pinch they can come up with some laughable elitist justification (If it's too easy, uninformed people will vote!), but most of the time they'll just say forthrightly that making registering and voting easier will help Democrats. Which means that making it harder helps Republicans. Or take gerrymandering, for which it is impossible to come up with even a remotely plausible justification. It's just about power: Our party has the power to draw lines that favor us, so we will. H.R. 1 doesn't give Democrats a \u201cthumb on the scale\u201d in redistricting, it would mandate that independent, nonpartisan commissions do the job. But Republicans cry that independence and nonpartisanship are unfair to them. They need gerrymandering, or else they'll be deprived of the advantage that allows them to win even when more voters prefer their opponents. So viewed another way, Republicans are right: The creation of an even playing field would indeed disadvantage them relative to the status quo, because they've successfully created an uneven playing field in so many states. A lawyer for the Arizona GOP basically admitted this at the Supreme Court this week. He was asked why the party was arguing that it's important to disqualify a legitimate voter's ballot if they mistakenly cast it in the wrong precinct. He replied that counting that vote would put Republicans \u201cat a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats,\u201d and added: \u201cPolitics is a zero-sum game.\u201d So the Republican argument comes down to this: Only an unfair system is fair to us. Any attempt to make the system fair must therefore be stopped When you hear them say that any electoral reform that makes voting easier is a plot to help Democrats, remember that that's what they mean. Nothing makes them more afraid than a well-functioning democracy. They aren't even pretending otherwise.

    "body": "Widespread Republican opposition to two major pieces of voting rights legislation is leading some Democratic lawmakers and activists to fear that Congress will be unable to pass either bill this year, even as several state legislatures enact restrictive voting measures.\n\nLater this month, the Senate is set to take up S. 1, or the For the People Act, an expansive but controversial voting and elections reform bill. The measure was already unlikely to pass, as Democrats hold a razor-thin 50-seat majority in the Senate, and 60 votes are required to advance most legislation. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin also announced Sunday that he opposes it, hammering another nail in its legislative coffin.\n\nBut Manchin does support another voting rights bill, one that has yet to be introduced in this session of Congress \u2014 the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named for the late congressman and civil rights icon.\n\nThis bill, also known as H.R. 4, would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act established a formula to determine which areas should be covered by Section 5, which required certain jurisdictions to submit any changes to the Justice Department or a panel of federal judges for approval. The law was reauthorized in 2006, but the formula for dictating which jurisdictions should be subject to preclearance had not been significantly updated.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down the formula in the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, a 5 to 4 decision divided along ideological lines. Lawmakers \"reenacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts, having no logical relationship to the present day,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his decision.\n\n\"Congress \u2014 if it is to divide the States \u2014 must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past,\" Roberts wrote. \"Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"\n\nThe high court did not strike down Section 5, but without a formula to determine which jurisdictions are subject to preclearance, it is entirely unenforceable.\n\nThe federal Commission on Civil Rights released a report in 2018 that found that several states had enacted \"newly restrictive statewide voter laws\" in the wake of the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, including closing polling places, limiting early voting, purging voter rolls and implementing stricter voter ID laws.\n\nAdvocates argue that it is even more important to pass both For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act now because of the recent efforts by Republican-led states to enact more restrictive voting measures. As of mid-May, state legislators have enacted at least 22 bills with restrictive voting provisions in 14 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Changes to voting procedures in several states, including Georgia, Arizona and Florida, have already been signed into law, while a bill overhauling elections in Texas has been temporarily stalled.\n\nThe John Lewis Voting Rights Act seeks to create a new formula for determining how jurisdictions should be subject to preclearance. But bill has to be both airtight constitutionally and provide evidence that certain jurisdictions are employing practices that specifically discriminate against minority voters.\n\nA version of the bill was introduced by Democratic Congresswoman Terri Sewell in 2019 and passed in the House, but stalled in the Senate, which was then controlled by Republicans. It would have subjected a state to preclearance for 10 years if 15 or more voting rights violations occurred in the state during the previous 25 years. A political jurisdiction would have been subject to preclearance for a 10-year period if three or more voting rights violations occurred there during the previous 25 years.\n\nSewell, who will be the lead sponsor for the bill again in this Congress, said in a statement to CBS News that \"never did I think that the cause for which the Foot Soldiers of the Civil Rights movement marched so many years ago would become new again.\"\n\n\"Leading the introduction of this bill on behalf of John Lewis is a great honor and comes with even greater responsibility. We know that this legislation will face court challenges which is why we must ensure that it is on solid constitutional ground before passing it. Nothing short of our democracy is at stake,\" Sewell said.\n\nSome Democrats have suggested pivoting focus to the John Lewis Voting Rights Act instead of the Voting Rights Act, as it may be more likely to garner Republican support. GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski was an original cosponsor of the bill when it was introduced in 2019, and is expected to support it again.\n\nBut Speaker Nancy Pelosi dashed any hopes of prioritizing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act in the House, saying in a letter to Democratic colleagues on Tuesday that \"H.R. 4 must be passed, but it will not be ready until the fall, and it is not a substitute for H.R. 1,\" referring to the House number for the For the People Act.\n\n\"When we pass H.R. 4, we must do so in a way that is ironclad constitutionally.\u00a0 This is what Congressman Butterfield and the House Judiciary Committee are hard at work on now,\" referring to Congressman G.K. Butterfield, who chairs the House Administration subcommittee overseeing federal elections.\n\nButterfield's subcommittee is conducting field hearings to compile evidence of discriminatory practices that will then be shared with the Judiciary Committee, which will do the markup for the bill. He said in an interview with CBS News that he expected his subcommittee to complete its work and provide \"thousands of pages\" of evidence by the end of June.\n\n\"We have evidence that there is widespread discrimination that is continuing in many states across the country,\" Butterfield said. He added that the voting restrictions enacted in several states across the country had a \"devastating impact on democracy.\" He said it was necessary to pass both the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act, saying that \"each one accomplishes a different outcome.\"\n\nSenator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, told reporters on Tuesday that it was a \"false choice\" to prioritize the John Lewis Voting Rights Act over For the People Act.\n\n\"I'm glad that we have the John Lewis bill, appropriately named in his honor. But let's be clear, John Lewis spent his last 10 years fighting for the provisions in the For the People Act,\" Warnock said. \"It's not an either or proposition. We've got to pass John Lewis in order to protect voting rights. We've got to pass the For the People Act to provide some basic standards for our elections.\"\n\nLike For the People Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act has very little chance of passing in the Senate. It is highly unlikely that nine other Republicans will join all Democrats in supporting the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came out Tuesday in opposition to the bill, indicating that it is incredibly unlikely that the bill will garner sufficient Republican support.\n\n\"There's no threat to the voting rights law,\" McConnell told reporters, arguing that the John Lewis Voting Rights Act would give the Justice Department too much power over states. \"I think it's unnecessary.\"\n\nSome progressives inside and out of Congress have pushed for eliminating the filibuster, which would allow legislation to advance with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. But ending the filibuster would require support from all 50 Democrats, and Manchin has emphatically said he would never agree to do so.\n\nManchin is not alone in his opposition either. Although he and Senator Kyrsten Sinema are the most vocal opponents of eliminating the filibuster, other Democrats have privately raised concerns about ending the practice as well.\n\nWith the filibuster likely to remain in place, Democrats have no choice but to continue to put pressure on Republicans. Although Butterfield said that \"we at this moment don't have any reason to believe that 10 or more Republicans will join with the 50 Democrats\" to support this bill, he nonetheless hoped that it would be able to garner support in the same way that the 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act did.\n\nButterfield said that he expected H.R. 4 to be brought to the House floor and passed by the end of September, and then hopefully be considered by the Senate by October.\n\n\"I sincerely believe that there are more than 10 Republicans that understand the urgency of updating the Voting Rights Act,\" Butterfield said.",

They also blasted automatic voter registration, claiming it would \u201cprovide too many opportunities for non-citizens and others ineligible to vote to register and cast fraudulent ballots before officials can take preventive action.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps most egregious is the Act\u2019s limitations on voter ID laws,\u201d\u00a0 the attorney generals continued. \u201cFairly considered, requiring government-issued photo identification at the polls represents nothing more than a best practice for election administration. Government-issued photo identification has been the global standard for documentary identification for decades.\u201d\n\nMembers of the GOP have largely criticized the legislation, painting it as a power grab by Democrats. A similar bill passed in the House last year but was not taken up by the Senate, then controlled by the GOP.\n\nThey attorneys general promised they would seek \"legal remedies\" if H.R. 1 is passed and becomes law.\n\n\"Despite recent calls for political unity, the Act takes a one-sided approach to governing and usurps states\u2019 authority over elections,\" the letter continued. \"With confidence in elections at a record low, the country\u2019s focus should be on building trust in the electoral process.\u00a0Around the nation, the 2020 general elections generated mass confusion and distrust\u2014problems that the Act would only exacerbate.\"",

The Drug Price Transparency in Medicaid Act of 2023 would eliminate the practice of spread pricing in state Medicaid programs, no longer intentionally reducing pharmacy reimbursement through this practice.\n  National Association of Specialty Pharmacy (NASP) President and CEO Sheila Arquette, RPh stated, \u201cNASP is pleased that bipartisan champions in the House have introduced a bill focused on protecting pharmacy and patient needs. Advancing this legislation will be a victory for patients, specialty pharmacies, the Medicaid program, and ultimately taxpayers. Anticompetitive business practices threaten specialty pharmacy businesses, and therefore, patient access to specialty pharmacies. Such practices ultimately result in patients forgoing the medications they need, resulting in life-threatening consequences and increased Medicaid costs through preventable hospitalizations and medical complications.\u201d\n  \u201cAddressing anti-competitive market practices impacting pharmacy is so important, especially as we seek to reduce health expenditures and support patients, particularly those with severe and complex medical conditions that require treatment with specialty medications. This bill will work to address practices by certain PBMs that are really intended to narrow pharmacy networks, harming Medicaid enrollee access to the pharmacies they need. NASP urges Congress to act on this important bill this year.\u201d\n   The National Association of Specialty Pharmacy (NASP) is the only national association representing all stakeholders in the specialty pharmacy industry. NASP members include the nation's leading specialty pharmacies, pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers, group purchasing organizations, patient advocacy groups, integrated delivery systems, PBMs, health plans, technology and data management vendors, logistics providers, wholesalers/distributors and practicing pharmacists, nurses, and pharmacy technicians. With over 170 corporate members and 3000 individual members, NASP unifies the voices of specialty pharmacy in the United States.\n  National Association of Specialty Pharmacy, 300 New Jersey Ave NW, STE 900, Washington, DC 20001, (703) 842-0122",

Mo Brooks (R-AL) blasted H.R.1, which the U.S. House of Representatives is considering on Wednesday, as the \u201cSocialist Democrat Election Fraud Enhancement Act,\u201d explaining the measure will do \u201cgreat damage\u201d to the security of America\u2019s election system nationwide.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday, Brooks highlighted the dangers of H.R.1, which is more commonly known as the \u201cFor the People Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it the \u2018Socialist Democrat Election Fraud Enhancement Act. It will do great damage to the reliability and security of America\u2019s election system,\u201d he said, listing off some of the specific changes the measure would make.\n\n\u201cThe socialists seek to mandate no-fault absentee ballots, which are the tool of choice for vote thieves. They seek to eliminate the photo identification requirement and, by the way, when the federal government does it, that eliminates all state laws to the contrary,\u201d Brooks said, explaining that it would repeal \u201cwho knows how many state statutes that protect the security of our election system.\u201d\n\nOverall, the act largely federalizes elections, taking the vast majority of power away from the states.\n\n\u201cIt, to a very large degree, federalizes and micromanages the election process administered by the states. It implemented, as I mentioned, some of the worst changes in election rules that occurred during the 2020 election. It requires states to restore the ability of felons to vote the moment they\u2019re out of prison, regardless of uncompleted parole, probation, or restitution requirements or what states may believe is the appropriate restoration of voting rights for convicted felons,\u201d he continued.\n\nIt is essential, Brooks told Breitbart News, for Republicans to stop the \u201csocialist Democrats\u201d from placing in federal law the \u201cvery systemic flaws\u201d that occurred during the highly contentious 2020 presidential election.\n\nOthers, Brooks said, would be \u201cwise\u201d to copy Alabama, which received an \u201cA\u201d rating from the group Concerned Women for America\u2019s election integrity scoreboard for its rules for its requirements for voter identification, handling of mail-in voting, and more.\n\nThe congressman said the Alabama state legislature has enacted \u201cgood laws\u201d on absentee ballots, requiring voters to provide proof of absenteeism, as well as requirements for photo identification, which Brooks said is \u201cprobably the number one way to minimize voter fraud.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama legislature, he added, has done a \u201cvery good job\u201d on election integrity measures, overall.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re ranked number one in election security, and we are a model that other states and the federal government would be wise to copy,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative, has described the measure as an \u201c800-page monstrosity\u201d that would ultimately result in the \u201cfederal takeover of the running of elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf\u00a0you\u2019re a state like Alabama or Texas that has a voter ID law, you might as well forget it, because this federal law would override all state voter ID laws so they\u2019re now unenforceable,\u201d he said during a January appearance on\u00a0SiriusXM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Daily.\n\nAccording to Politico, the first votes for H.R.1 are expected to begin between noon at 1:30 Eastern.\n\nBreitbart News reported yesterday that a Texas judge and three other people were indicted by a grand jury on 150 counts related to voter fraud during\u00a0the 2018 Medina County Primary Election.",

The Justice Department last month rushed out a lawsuit claiming that Georgia\u2019s new election law violates Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act only days before the Supreme Court laid down standards that make the lawsuit a nearly certain loser.\n\nJustice knew the likely timing of the Court\u2019s ruling in Brnovich v. DNC, so a fair guess is that Mr. Garland succumbed to White House and progressive pressure to make a political statement to support Democratic efforts in Congress to federalize state election laws in H.R.1.\n\nBad call. Now federal judges hearing the case will have to contend with Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s five principles in Brnovich as they assess the Georgia statute.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy to find legal fault under those principles. Mere voting inconvenience can\u2019t be considered disqualifying, since all voting imposes some inconvenience. Any specific voting provision, such as the number of drop boxes, must also be considered in the overall context of a state\u2019s voting rules. Georgia\u2019s rules are generally lenient and don\u2019t especially burden the ability of minorities to vote.\n\nPerhaps Justice can find a federal judge somewhere to rule against Georgia, but such a ruling is unlikely to survive on appeal to higher courts. The legal and political result of the lawsuit is therefore likely to vindicate Georgia Republicans during the 2022 election season or leading up to 2024, depending on how the lawsuits proceed. Mr. Garland would be wise to drop the suit in light of Brnovich, lest his term at Justice be marred by the continuation of this patently political lawsuit.",

    "body": "A virtually similar bill, H.R. 1, has already passed the House of Representatives on a party-line vote. The bill, among its provisions, would create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting.\n\nBoth senators are co-sponsors of the companion Senate legislation, so the odds are slim that the ad will have an effect. (The ad also looks like it was produced with a minimal budget.) But perhaps it might convince voters that the Democrats are supporting what the ad calls a \u201cpartisan power grab.\u201d\n\nA number of statements are made in the ad, but for the purposes of this fact check, we are going on focus on the ad\u2019s claim that the bill is designed to allow undocumented immigrants to vote \u2014 a charge that would have particular resonance in a border state.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993, commonly known as the \u201cmotor voter law,\u201d made it possible for state motor vehicle agencies and social-service agencies to register voters. The proposed law would implement what is known as Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) at motor-vehicle agencies, government agencies and public universities.\n\nNoah Weinrich, press secretary for Heritage Action, cited a critical report issued by the Heritage Foundation concerning H.R.1. The report claimed that the bill\u2019s requirement that states automatically register individuals from state and federal databases, such as state Departments of Motor Vehicles, \u201cwould register large numbers of ineligible voters, including aliens.\u201d\n\nWeinrich also cited an article by Hans von Spakovsky, a Heritage senior legal fellow, that criticized as \u201cbiased\u201d a CNN fact check of former vice president Mike Pence attacking the bill.\n\n\u201cThe complex sections of HR 1 on automatic voter registration require numerous state and federal agencies to send information on individuals to state election officials so they can be registered,\u201d Spakovsky wrote. \u201cMany state and federal agencies don\u2019t have citizenship data on the individuals they deal with.\u201d He added that \u201cHR 1 specifically states that no alien can be \u2018prosecuted under any federal or state law\u2019 or \u2018adversely affected in any civil adjudication concerning immigration status or naturalization\u2019 due to being automatically registered.\u201d\n\nWhile Heritage makes this sound nefarious, as of February, automatic voter registration has already been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia, so over a third of Americans live in jurisdictions that have either passed or implemented AVR, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. In this legislative cycle, 39 states have introduced legislation to implement or expand automatic registration.\n\n\u201cAVR makes voter registration \u2018opt-out\u2019 instead of \u2018opt-in\u2019 \u2014 eligible citizens who interact with government agencies are registered to vote or have their existing registration information updated, unless they affirmatively decline. Again, the voter can opt-out; it is not compulsory registration,\u201d a Brennan Center report says. \u201cSecond, those agencies transfer voter registration information electronically to election officials instead of using paper registration forms. These common-sense reforms increase registration rates, clean up the voter rolls, and save states money.\u201d\n\nAs an example of the potential pitfalls of AVR, Weinrich pointed to an issue that California had in 2018 when it implemented an AVR program through the Department of Motor Vehicles, resulting in thousands of erroneous registrations, including at least one involving a noncitizen. It turned out there was a programming flaw that caused the system to mix up records, officials said at the time. The registrations were canceled and any vote-by-mail ballots, if issued, were suspended. The computer glitch was quickly detected, contained and corrected.\n\nSince 2018, records show, California has registered 2.2 million new voters through the DMV and re-registered 4.8 million voters \u2014 and more than 7 million Californians have opted out of voter registration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how few of the states that have AVR actually experienced these types of glitches,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, who directs Brennan\u2019s Democracy Program.\n\nIn any case, registration of an ineligible voter is already a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison (52 U.S. Code \u00a7 20511). It is also unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate in federal office (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 611).\n\nPeter Whippy, communications director for the House Administration Committee, pointed to several items in H.R. 1\u2019s text that provide safeguards to ensure ineligible people are not registered to vote. H.R. 1 requires every state to implement an automatic voter registration system, but the bill continually makes it clear that only citizens are eligible to be registered. H.R. 1 also requires eligible voters to affirm that they are U.S. citizens before they are added to the voter rolls.\n\nSec. 1012(c): [One-time Registration of Voters Based on Existing Contributing Agency Records] State officials are required to provide applicants with the following: \u201cthe substantive qualifications of an elector in the State \u2026 \u201d as well as \u201cthe consequences of false registration, and a statement that the individual should decline to register if the individual does not meet all those qualifications.\u201d\nSec. 1012(c): [One-time Registration of Voters Based on Existing Contributing Agency Records] also provides that state officials must send written notice to each individual \u201cof the individual\u2019s voter registration status,\u201d keeping them apprised of their status and thus able to change their status should they so desire.\nSec. 1013: [Contributing Agency Assistance in Registration] provides that \u201ceach contributing agency that (in the normal course of its operations) requests individuals to affirm United States citizenship (either directly or as part of the overall application for service or assistance) shall inform such individual \u2026 \u201d of the \u201csubstantive qualifications\u201d required to vote, and that they will be registered to vote unless they decline to register or are found ineligible.\n\n\nAs for the provision cited by von Spakovsky, Whippy said that is intended to provide \u201ca safe harbor for any immigrants inadvertently being added to the voter rolls due to a similar state error and avoid potential deportation or adverse legal action through no fault of their own.\u201d\n\nWeiser said that in the states that have implemented AVR, it had proved to be more reliable and error-free than relying on people\u2019s own assertions that they are eligible to vote. That\u2019s because agencies often already have information on whether a person is eligible to vote, she said.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIn this ad, Heritage Action has taken a somewhat remote possibility that undocumented immigrants would be registered as voters under AVR and turned it into a Democrat desire \u2014 that they \u201cwant to register illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s against the law for noncitizens to vote. Second, the proposed law contains numerous safeguards to prevent that from happening \u2014 safeguards that would not be in place if Democrats really planned to enlist noncitizens as voters.\n\nHeritage Action can point to only one example when an AVR system inadvertently signed up people not eligible to vote \u2014 a computer glitch in 2018 that was quickly discovered and corrected, with the registrations canceled. Since then, no other such problems have emerged in California.\n\nIf Heritage had made the case that undocumented immigrants might inadvertently be registered, despite the proposed safeguards, this might have been a Three Pinocchio claim. Errors are always possible with new systems. But claiming, without evidence, that Democrats want to enlist illegal voters tips this claim to Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form",

    "body": "House Republicans introduced legislation Friday that would forbid foreign companies with known human rights violations from leasing and operating mines on federal land, part of a broader effort to boost domestic energy and mining.\n\nThe restriction on \u201cforeign bad actors\u201d comes as part of a broader GOP package intended to streamline permitting for mining projects on federal lands and increase \u201cresponsible development of domestic energy and mineral resources,\u201d according to a fact sheet issued by Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. By boosting American mining, the proposed legislation \u2014 part of a major Republican energy package known as the Lower Energy Costs Act \u2014 would help prevent America from becoming \u201cbeholden\u201d to China, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said in an interview with Fox Business March 9. (RELATED: GOP Energy Package To Limit Rule \u2018Weaponized\u2019 By Blue States Against Natural Gas Pipelines)\n\n\u201cEnergy security is national security. Republicans are delivering on our promises to the American people by unleashing the full power of our energy and minerals, cutting permitting delays, creating jobs, growing our economy, and dealing a blow to China and Russia,\u201d Westerman said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cAt long last, H.R. 1 will give Americans the tools to tap into our resources and build stronger, more resilient communities than ever before.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s stranglehold on mineral supply chains has helped the country secure a dominating position in the global market for electric vehicles, but the mines that support the industry have been linked to the forced labor of Uyghur Muslims. The U.S market for solar panels plunged in 2022, after U.S. Customs and Border Protection began enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, impounding shipments of panels suspected of being developed using Uyghur slave labor.\n\nToday, House Majority Leader @SteveScalise, @RepWesterman, @cathymcmorris and @RepSamGraves introduced H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. Read Chairman Westerman\u2019s statement below \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/QZyLjlJ7ck \u2014 House Committee on Natural Resources (@NatResources) March 14, 2023\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, also sought to decouple America\u2019s supply chain from China, by providing significant tax breaks for companies to manufacture electric vehicles and mine battery materials domestically. The president\u2019s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2024 included $6 billion in funding to \u201cout-compete\u201d China, in part by expanding U.S. business\u2019 access to foreign markets.\n\n\u201cChina controls 95% of the processing of critical minerals. They control 90% of minerals\u2026 critical minerals themselves,\u201d McCarthy told Fox Business\u2019 Larry Kudlow. \u201cSo we\u2019re gonna open [American mining] up in an environmentally sound, safe, way that we can mine that we can produce more electric cars but not be beholden to China or any other country.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the proposed legislation would impact firms like Lithium Americas, which is only owned in part by Chinese mining giant Ganfeng Lithium through subsidiary GFL International. A federal judge upheld a 2021 decision to approve Lithium Americas\u2019 proposal to establish a major lithium mine in Nevada, although the project has drawn criticism from Republicans due to the firm\u2019s connection to China.\n\nThe office of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who introduced the legislation, did not immediately respond to a DCNF request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "body": "President Joseph Robinette Biden last fall accused Republicans of \u201cdoubling down on an extreme position\u201d on abortion.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shrieked: \u201cWith Roe now out of their way, extreme MAGA Republicans are gleefully charging ahead with their deadly crusade to punish and control women\u2019s health decisions.\u201d (RELATED: DEROY MURDOCK: McCarthy\u2019s Agenda Should Focus On Unmasking Democrats)\n\nWell, look who\u2019s extreme now.\n\nPelosi\u2019s successor, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy magnificently helped Democrats expose themselves as weapons-grade abortion extremists. He offered Democrats two opportunities to display a modicum of moderation on this issue.\n\nDemocrats failed these tests miserably, and down fell the masks behind which they pretended to be reasonable.\n\nFirst, H.R. 26, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, requires healthcare practitioners to provide medical care to any live baby who survives an abortion, despite attempts to murder it in the womb.\n\nA grand total of one Democrat, Texas\u2019 Henry Cuellar, joined 219 unanimous Republicans and gave a fighting chance to any baby who somehow manages not to get vacuumed from a uterus and tossed into the trash.\n\nWhile 100% of Republicans defended these human beings, 99.5% of Democrats (210 of 211) offered abortion-proof babies this advice: \u201cDrop dead.\u201d\n\nSecond, McCarthy scheduled House Concurrent Resolution 3, which states:\n\n\u201cWhereas, following the leak of the draft Dobbs decision, radical anti-life advocates initiated a pressure campaign designed to influence the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion;\n\n\u201cWhereas, following the leak and issuance of the Dobbs decision, radical anti-life advocates have defaced, vandalized, and caused destruction to over 100 pro-life facilities, groups, and churches.\u201d\n\nBy detailing these outrages, H.R. 3 is a menu of disgusting flavors:\n\nGraffiti: Twenty-six instances of spray-painted slogans include \u201cFake clinic,\u201d \u201cForced birth is murder,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re coming for U,\u201d \u201cGod is a woman,\u201d \u201cGod loves abortion,\u201d \u201cAbort the court,\u201d and \u201cIf abortions aren\u2019t safe, then you aren\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nThe graffito \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge\u201d appears repeatedly. These revolutionary, pro-abortion terrorists do not respect a woman\u2019s choice to keep her baby. Instead, they claim credit for at least 12 hits against pro-life centers in eight states and Washington, D.C.\n\nEarth to Attorney General Merrick Garland: This is the quintessence of conspiracy across state lines.\n\nVandalism: Nineteen episodes involved smashed windows, defaced signs, damaged staff vehicles, and more.\n\nArson: Five fires, including blazes at three churches in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nFirebombing: Last Mother\u2019s Day, goons hurled two Molotov cocktails at Oregon Right to Life\u2019s office in Keizer. Jane\u2019s Revenge boasted that it firebombed Compass Care\u2019s Amherst, New York, crisis-pregnancy center. This pandemonium injured two firefighters on the scene.\n\nBreaking and entering: According to H.R. 3, \u201con June 25, 2022, radical leftist rioters breached the Arizona State Capitol, forcing legislators to evacuate the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was basically a January 6-style event,\u201d State Representative Neal K. Carter told me. \u201cState Senate proceedings were interrupted, and it adjourned to an underground tunnel. Fortunately, the House was not breached, but we heard the gun-like sound of law enforcement firing tear-gas canisters and were alarmed to watch a palm tree burning after being struck by a tear-gas projectile.\u201d\n\nAssault: Per the bill, a female \u201cwas accused of assault after throwing eggs and a dead raccoon at the Northeast Ohio Women\u2019s Center.\u201d\n\nSome institutions suffered combinations of these onslaughts.\n\nThe House\u2019s response: Universal revulsion?\n\nHardly.\n\nOnly three Democrats joined 219 Republicans, 100% of whom voted Aye, thus \u201ccondemning the recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches.\u201d\n\nAmong Democrats, 209 of 212 voted Nay and thereby refused to denounce this pro-abortion vandalism, arson, and other destruction. Hence, 98.6% of House Democrats accept this devastation.\n\n\n\nThis is not JFK\u2019s Democrat Party. This is not MLK\u2019s Democrat Party. This is not even WJC\u2019s Democrat Party. William Jefferson Clinton\u2019s \u201cSafe, legal, and rare\u201d approach to abortion is as dead as King Tut.\n\nJRB\u2019s Democrat Party is AOK with busted windows, broken doors, and blazing churches, all to protect abortion \u2013 even against living, breathing newborns \u2013 always, everywhere, and with pompoms waving.\n\nDeroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News Contributor.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Sheila Jackson Lee\u2019s (D-TX) Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act.\n\n\u201cThis is what this hearing is about \u2014 to be able to speak to the nation and for the nation to continue its overwhelming support that it has given to H.R. 40. And that has been one of the comforting aspects of continuing to carry this legislation,\u201d Jackson Lee said at the start of the hearing, describing it as an \u201cactive commission\u201d designed to study and \u201cdevelop reparation proposals.\u201d\n\nWalker testified as a witness against the proposal, citing both his faith and the impracticality of issuing reparations.\n\n\u201cWe use black power to create white guilt. My approach is biblical. How can I ask my Heavenly Father to forgive me if I can\u2019t forgive my brother?\u201d Walker asked as he began his statement.\n\n\u201cI never want to put any one religion down; my religion teaches togetherness. Reparations teach separation,\u201d he said, noting that slavery ended 130 years ago and adding that history is not properly taught in school.\n\nAmerica, Walker said, is the \u201cgreatest country in the world,\u201d describing it as a \u201cmelting pot of a lot of great races, a lot of great minds that have come together with different ideas to make American the greatest country on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany have died trying to get into America. No one\u2019s dying trying to get out,\u201d he said before posing questions on the practicality of issuing reparations.\n\n\u201cReparations \u2014 where would the money come from? Does it come from all the other races except the black taxpayers?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat percentage of black must you be to receive reparation? Do you go to 23andMe or DNA test to determine the percentage of blackness?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome American ancestors just came to their country 80 years ago,\u201d he said, noting that their ancestors were not even in America during slavery.\u00a0 \u201cSome black immigrants weren\u2019t here during slavery, nor their ancestors. Some states didn\u2019t even have slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe as black Americans have always wanted what the Constitution stated: All men, black white and today Latino, Asian, Italian, etcetera, should be guaranteed\u201d the rights of\u00a0 \u201clife freedom and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYears later after slavery ended, Dr. King said, the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation was a great beacon of light but one hundred years later, we\u2019re still not free because of segregation and discrimination. Today, I call that reparation,\u201d Walker continued.\n\nThe former NFL star said he spoke to his mother, who is in her mid-80s, on reparations and presented her words.\n\nHer words. \u201cI do not believe in reparation. Who is the money going to go to? Has anyone thought of paying the families who lost someone in the Civil War who fought for their freedom? Your Dad and I taught you \u2026 to provide for you and your family through a good education and hard work. If you give a man a fish, you feed him a day. If you teach him to fish, you feed him a lifetime. Reparation is only feeding you for a day.\u201d\n\nShe also asked, \u201cwho is the guilty party?\u201d\n\n\u201cShould we start at the beginning, where African Americans sold their African American ancestors into slavery?\u201d she asked as Walker continued to pose his mother\u2019s questions.\n\nUltimately, Walker said he saw the struggles of \u201cfellow football brothers of other races\u201d and heard them going through the same struggles that he experienced. He brought up\u00a0Ezekiel 18:20 and identified a good quality education and \u201copportunities with responsibilities\u201d as a key way to help people of various races.\n\n\u201cReparation is a fee or a correction for the terrible sin of slave owners, government, and others, but we punish the nonguilty party,\u201d he said, noting that is \u201ccreating division, separation with different races.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel it continues to let us know that we are still African American rather than just American. Reparation, atonement, is outside the teaching of Jesus Christ,\u201d he said as he closed.\n\nH.R. 40 would specifically \u201cexamine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.\u201d\n\nHerschel Walker also spoke against reparations last year on Fox News.",

Joe Manchin last week said he didn't think Congress should pass the entire thing at once.\nPsaki's comments come after the Senate held a heated hearing on the legislation, S.1 in the Senate and H.R. 1 in the House, last week which saw Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., trading accusations of \"shame.\"\nAfter the hearing, Manchin, D-W.Va.,\u00a0released a statement saying that he supports some of the bill but that Congress would risk decreasing Americans' trust in elections by passing H.R. 1 or S.1 along party lines. Manchin is the only Democrat in the Senate that is not a co-sponsor of S.1.\u00a0\n\"America's declining trust in the government and each other makes it harder to solve key problems,\" Manchin said. \"That trust will continue to diminish unless we, as members of Congress, transcend partisanship to strengthen our democracy by protecting voting rights, implementing commonsense election security reforms, and\u00a0making our campaign finance system more transparent.\"\n\n      White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a briefing at the White House, Monday, March 29, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n      ((AP Photo/Evan Vucci))\n\n\nSCHUMER, MCCONNELL SPAR OVER DEMS' S1 ELECTION BILL DURING RARE COMMITTEE APPEARANCE: 'SHAME!'\n\"Pushing through legislation of this magnitude on a partisan basis may garner short-term benefits, but will inevitably only exacerbate the distrust that millions of Americans harbor against the U.S. government,\" he added.\u00a0\nThe moderate senator\u00a0who has seen his power skyrocket with the Senate split 50-50 said he supports expanded early voting, help for Native Americans, limiting dark money in politics and more. But his opposition to doing all that and much, much more in one fell swoop essentially killed any chance Democrats had of getting S.1 through the Senate intact.\u00a0\n\"We know that there's going to be a process ... it's going to work its way through Congress,\" Psaki said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Wednesday, in response to Manchin and reports other Democrats were backing away from the bill too. \"We always expected that there would be some changes\u00a0to the House bill as it worked its way through the Senate, because as you all know, there's differences of opinion.\"\nPsaki added: \"Whether it's multiple bills, one big bill, we'll let the Senate work that through. Our focus is really ensuring that there is a bill passed on the president's desk that will make voting easier, more accessible, and we're confident that there's a way to do that.\"\n\n      Sen.

John Lewis, D-Ga., before S.1.\u00a0\n\"The Georgia law brings again to light the need to get reforms in place that people can come together around,\" Psaki said, referring to a recently passed law in Georgia aimed at boosting election security.\u00a0\"We\u00a0are very open to whatever order the Senate, leaders in the Senate, Leader Schumer and others think it appropriate here. We would like to see both pieces of legislation pass.\"\u00a0\nS.1 and its companion legislation, H.R.1, which passed the House with only Democratic votes, would ban\u00a0states from requiring photo ID\u00a0to vote; raise\u00a0barriers for states to clear voter rolls; require\u00a0states to offer drop boxes for 45 days before an election and much more.\u00a0\nIt would also change the makeup of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) from six total members with three from each party to a body with two members from each party and a third unaffiliated with either party but appointed by the president. Republicans say that this provision, along with many others in the bill, makes the bill more of a partisan power grab than a civil rights bill, as Democrats frame it.\u00a0\n\"Talk\u00a0about shame. If anybody ought to be feeling any shame around here, it's turning the FEC into a partisan prosecutor, the majority controlled by the president's party, to harass and intimidate the other side,\" McConnell said\u00a0at last week's hearing.\u00a0\"That's what you ought to be ashamed about.\"\n\n      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., speaks during a news conference with other Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020.

That program has capacity for 34,500 more applicants, but this may not be enough.\n\nOn July 22, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to provide 8,000 more visas under the SIV program for Afghan interpreters, contractors and other U.S. allies who may be vulnerable as the Taliban seizes the country.\n\nThe House voted in favor of the resolution H.R. 3985, introduced by Representative Jason Crow, by 407 votes to 16.\n\nAll the \"nay\" votes were Republicans and the bill was sent to the Senate, though it has yet to be passed by that chamber.\n\nThe Republicans who voted against the resolution were: Andy Biggs of Arizona, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Bob Good of Virginia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Jody Hice of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Barry Moore of Alabama, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Bill Posey of Florida, Matthew Rosendale of Montana and Chip Roy of Texas.\n\nJason Crow, who is a Democrat representing Colorado's 6th congressional district, spoke about the resolution on July 22.\n\n\"Some members of this body, including me, may not be here today without the service and self-sacrifice of Afghans who answered the call to serve shoulder to shoulder with us,\" Crow said.\n\nH.R. 3985 would create 8,000 new SIVs and also expand eligibility to include the family members of applicants who have been killed and Afghans who have worked with certain nongovernmental organizations and who may now be facing persecution but who would not have qualified previously.\n\nWhen reached for comment by Newsweek on Tuesday, Representative Roy's office pointed to a statement issued on July 22 that noted Roy had voted against the resolution because of a Democratic amendment that \"raises serious questions and concerns by broadening the categories for SIV eligibility to include individuals that never directly assisted the U.S. government and weakening the standards of the program.\"\n\n\"I likely would have voted for the underlying bill, however a Manager's Amendment added language to the bill that I ultimately could not support,\" Roy said on the House floor at the time.\n\n\"That amendment 'expands the program to include nonprofits and grantees, private organizations that contributed to the United States mission in Afghanistan.' We don't know who would be included,\" he said.\n\nRepresentative Rosendale's office pointed Newsweek to a statement he issued on Afghanistan on Monday.\n\n\"The total collapse of the Afghan government is the result of decades of failure and deception by the bipartisan foreign policy elite, which is even now trying to reverse the correct decision to withdraw American troops,\" Rosendale's statement said.\n\nThe statement went on to say the withdrawal was \"catastrophically mismanaged\" but \"this does not change the basic fact that it was the right decision.\"\n\n\"The chaos we're seeing is not an excuse to flood our country with refugees from Afghanistan,\" Rosendale said.\n\nA spokesperson for Representative DesJarlais told Newsweek on Tuesday: \"Congressman DesJarlais supports bringing in interpreters and allies that assisted us in the war effort.\n\n\"However, there is concern about the broad net being cast by the Biden administration that will surely let potential terrorists slip through the cracks. Rep. DesJarlais would like to see a better vetting plan in place before the United States starts bringing 40,000 to 60,000 Afghans and their families to our country.\"\n\nRepresentative Massie told Newsweek on Tuesday: \"The program to extend visas to those who helped our military already exists and I support that program. The vote on the new measure was to greatly expand the number of visas and to include categories of people who did not help us in the war, while simultaneously reducing the vetting of these immigrants.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is now in the process of evacuating SIV applicants from Afghanistan. The Department of Defense's evacuation efforts are being led by Garry Reid, director of Defense Intelligence.\n\nReid told a press conference at the Pentagon on Monday that the DOD has plans to evacuate 20,000 to 22,000 additional SIV applicants, possibly to Fort McCoy in Wisconsin and Fort Bliss in Texas.\n\n\"There may be other sites identified if services are needed, if additional capacity is needed,\" Reid said. \"As with the operation we've been supporting at Fort Lee [Virginia], persons that come to these locations will have been pre-screened by the Department of Homeland Security to enter on condition of full immigration processing once they arrive.\"\n\nNewsweek has asked the representatives who voted against H.R. 3985 for comment.\n\nUPDATE 08/17/21 10.55 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include a statement from Representative Thomas Massie.\n\nUPDATE 08/17/21 10.06 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include statements from Representatives Chip Roy, Matthew Rosendale and Scott DesJarlais.",

He said that, coupled with their apparent support of H.R. 1, shows just how \u201ccorrupted\u201d some of the large corporations have become.\n\n\u201c[F]irst of all, H.R. 1 is the corrupt politicians\u2019 act. It eliminates all the barriers that protect us and allow honest citizens to count honest votes,\u201d Gingrich outlined. \u201cSecond, almost everything about the Georgia law is a lie \u2014 just plain a lie. When President Biden is reading off, I assume, his staff notes said that you couldn\u2019t get water standing in line. That\u2019s flat, plain untrue. In fact, it specifically authorizes the voting officials to provide water for people standing in line if it\u2019s hot. When they say it reduces the number of hours you can vote, that\u2019s just plain a lie. It actually increases the number of hours you can vote. But here is the deal \u2014 Coca-Cola is not going to say a word about all the things the Chinese totalitarian government does. They\u2019re not going to have any courage at all about standing up to China because it cost them too much. But living in a woke world with higher woke staff who come out of really elite universities and tell them, \u2018Oh yeah, this is the right thing to do, boss. You know, you really have to get out there and be tough,\u2019 and then they hand them the stuff that is just plain lies.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful how many large American corporations will beat up on conservatives and then stand silently by while the Chinese communists kill people, kill Uighurs, run concentration camps, and have totalitarian control over the society. It tells you how corrupted so many of these large corporations have become. And what they are doing, frankly, I think is eroding any authority they have with the public because the public is going to look at the head of Coca-Cola and say, \u2018I got it. You are in the tank to the left and you\u2019re willing to put out whatever your staff writes.'\u201d",

    "body": "closer to realizing our Founders' assertion that all of us are equal. It was the pinnacle of the civil rights movement. That movement led to landmark civil rights legislation, including the Voting Rights Act . The law made it possible for people such as my grandparents to vote. After enduring decades of obstacles in Jim Crow South Carolina, this law finally represented progress to them and so many others. Recently, thousands of Americans across the country gathered to mark the 58th anniversary of the March on Washington and renew the call for updated voting rights legislation. On the eve of that day, GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel published an op-ed in The Hill criticizing H.R. 4 , the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This split screen is telling. Americans remain steadfast in their commitment to the right to vote. They know that people like Congressman John Lewis bled to secure that sacred right. They've heard the stories from their elders about the dogs, the billy clubs and the water hoses turned upon Black Americans. They know how far we've come, and they never want to go back. Chair McDaniel and the Republican Party, on the other hand, appear to have lost their way. They've apparently decided that voting rights no longer serve them. For decades, voting rights were supported by Democrats and Republicans. Broad, bipartisan majorities of Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act five times. I worked alongside Congressman Lewis and members of both parties to pass the last reauthorization with overwhelming support. At the state level, moderate Republicans such as former Michigan Gov. George Romney , McDaniel's grandfather, championed civil rights and marched alongside other activists. Leaders set politics aside to affirm the sacred right to vote. Today's Republican Party, led by Donald Trump, Ronna McDaniel, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have trampled that legacy. And while McDaniel makes a variety of claims to avoid owning up to her party's anti-voting rights stance, her argument is lacking. Her first argument centers on the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act. She portrays it as outdated and unnecessary but fails to state the true purpose of the provision - to ensure equity for voters of color. Preclearance applied to states that, over decades, had perfected the art of disenfranchising voters of color via ruthless but superficially neutral tools such as literacy tests and grandfather clauses. The preclearance requirement mandated that these states get approval from the Justice Department before changing voting laws. It ensured that they couldn't just replace old Jim Crow voter suppression tactics with new ones. Preclearance worked. Black voter registration and turnout rates soared in covered states before it was struck down by a conservative majority of the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder . The majority reasoned that preclearance had been so effective at creating equity in voting rights that the problem had been solved. But preclearance had barely gone away before voter suppression returned with a vengeance Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained the absurdity of the Shelby County decision well. She said, \"Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\" The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would modernize and restore preclearance. It would prevent voting laws that unevenly burden voters of color. It would take important steps to limit gerrymandering and make sure that politicians don't get to handpick their voters and entrench their power. In short, it would be the most significant federal expansion of voting rights in a generation. The Republicans fail to mention any of this when they rail against it. McCarthy and McConnell omit the fact that they once supported the Voting Rights Act and provisions such as preclearance. McConnell once said \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" when talking about the Voting Rights Act. Now, he's against passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and restoring the law to its former strength. So what's different? Voting rights remain urgently important. All that has changed is the Republican Party's commitment to that right. They'll still call Lewis a hero . They'll still send the annual tweet honoring Dr. King . But their actions no longer match their words. They are responsible for a rising tide of voter suppression across the country, one that the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act could halt. Republicans don't oppose this bill on principle; they apparently oppose it because it threatens their positions of power. They see the diverse, growing coalition of supporters we've built and that their power and influence are shrinking. But Americans are committed to voting rights - a majority support provisions of H.R. 4, despite what McDaniel claims. Democrats support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act because we believe in the strength of our policies and trust the judgment of the American people. We want all voters to have a chance to judge us on what we deliver. Democrats are committed to making sure every voice is heard and every vote counts. We know the American people are, too. That's why we won't just talk about the legacy of John Lewis - we'll act to carry it forward. We will fight to make sure H.R. 4 becomes law.

Under the Democratic bill H.R.1, expect a lot more Donald Trumps and Stacey Abramses.\n\nSome say we should calm down about the proposed sweeping changes because academic research shows that electoral tweaks, in the end, don\u2019t confer lasting partisan advantage. This misses a key wrinkle. In a duopoly market, the parties (which are basically marketing organizations) indeed will always tend to gravitate to messages and strategies that divide the electorate down the middle. And big data is apparently making them better at it. The real problem with H.R.1 begins exactly here: Its greater incentive for partisans to allege cheating and refuse to honor outcomes when races are close and even when they aren\u2019t.\n\nMr. Trump, in his Feb. 28 CPAC speech, presented a vision of voting in which most votes are cast in person on Election Day. Guess what, this served as our least-bad solution for two centuries. In-person voting is good for two things. It makes it possible for independent monitors physically to observe who votes. It makes it possible for them to observe how ballots are handled and stored.\n\nThe flaw in mass mail-in voting, which Democrats would make universal, is that nothing is observable except the counting. You can\u2019t see who votes; you can\u2019t see how ballots are collected, transported or stored. Every election in the future, in effect, would be decided by mail-in ballots opaquely delivered to the counting table. And never again might a candidate see a personal upside to conceding that a close defeat was fairly arrived at.\n\nDemocrats insist with great simplemindedness that making voting easier is, ipso facto, good. They are partly right: Confidence depends on the vote seeming truly representative. Under any rule tweak, though, research has shown, the nonvoting public and the voting public don\u2019t differ much except in affluence. And no matter how easy we make voting, participation will go down and not up if outcomes are constantly roiled by accusations of cheating.",

    "body": "In this article:  Rudy Giuliani  Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images\n Trump's former national security advisor was worried that Giuliani was a foreign \"influence agent.\"  That's according to the forthcoming book, \"The Divider: Trump in the White House.\"  H.R. McMaster was so concerned about Giuliani that he made sure he was in the Oval Office whenever Giuliani visited Trump, the book said.  Donald Trump's one-time national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, was deeply concerned that former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was an agent of a foreign government and made sure he was in the Oval Office whenever Giuliani paid Trump a visit.  That's according to \" ,\" by The New York Times' Peter Baker and The New Yorker's Susan Glasser, an advance copy of which was obtained by Insider.  McMaster served as Trump's national security advisor from February 2017 to March 2018. His rocky tenure was marked by frequent spats with Trump over the latter's capitulation to strongmen like Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, said that although most \"people think he loves Putin,\" Erdogan \"is the one he loves.\" Indeed, the Turkish government shelled out millions of dollars to hire people close to Trump's orbit, including his first national security advisor Michael Flynn, who was for working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the 2016 campaign.  And according to \"The Divider,\" McMaster, who succeeded Flynn as a national security advisor, told people he was \"so concerned about Trump's friend Rudy Giuliani acting as an 'influence agent' on behalf of Turkish or other interests that he had a policy of making sure he was in the Oval Office whenever the former New York mayor visited.\"  It wouldn't be the first time Giuliani was suspected of being a foreign agent.  While working as Trump's personal defense attorney, Giuliani spearheaded a campaign to dig up dirt on the Bidens ahead of the 2020 US election. His efforts came under prosecutorial scrutiny in 2019 as investigators began examining whether he broke foreign lobbying laws.  Story continues  Specifically, the Manhattan US attorney's office wanted to know if Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine were carried out solely in his capacity as Trump's lawyer or whether he was also working on behalf of foreign interests who believed they would benefit from Trump's reelection.  The investigation entered an aggressive new phase in April 2021 when FBI agents raided Giuliani's apartment, his office, and the home of Victoria Toensing, an associate of his in Washington, DC. They seized 18 of Giuliani's electronic devices and also seized devices belonging to his longtime personal assistant Jo Ann Zafonte.  The inquiry has appeared to wind down in the last few months, however, and The New York Times that the feds recently returned Giuliani's devices to him, a sign that he's unlikely to face criminal charges connected to his work in Ukraine.  But Giuliani's legal troubles aren't quite over. Georgia state prosecutors informed the former New York mayor last month that of a wide-ranging criminal investigation into Trump allies' efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, one of seven battleground states that pushed Biden to victory.  Giuliani testified before a special grand jury hearing evidence in the investigation in mid-August.  Read the original article on",

    "body": "Drug pricing advocates, including many from AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) stage a protest in ... [+] front of San Diego Congressman Scott Peters' (D-CA) District Office on Friday, Sept. 17, 2021 in San Diego, Calif. The advocates were protesting Peters' vote earlier in the week against a drug pricing reform bill by House leadership that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with drug companies. With Peters' vote against the bill, the vote ended in a 29 to 29 tie.(Christy Radecic/AP Images for AIDS Healthcare Foundation)\n \n   \n  ASSOCIATED PRESS \n  \n \nAs Democratic leaders try to establish a politically feasible path forward for the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, they appear to be caving in to the demands of a small, but influential group of House and Senate centrists who have voiced objections to comprehensive, system-wide drug pricing reform.\n \n \nLast month, there was ample forewarning that the lofty ambitions of top Democrats would be met with resistance from within the party. First, there was the release of the White House plan on drug pricing in mid September. Though it pushed for Medicare negotiation of drug prices, it signaled that international price referencing was no longer in play.\n \nUse of international price benchmarks is a hallmark of H.R. 3 (Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act), a bill that passed the House in 2019 and formed a blueprint for initial discussions on what to include in the budget reconciliation bill. Sponsored by House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other top-level Democrats, its featured negotiation tactic for Medicare is pegging the prices of branded drugs facing limited competition to the average prices paid in a group of peer nations. If implemented, such a move would result in steep price cuts. Moreover, prices would be available to all purchasers, including commercial insurers.\n \n \nFive House Democrats came up with an alternative plan to decrease drug prices, a bill called the Reduced Costs and Continued Cures Act. It was introduced by Representatives Scott Peters (California) and Kurt Schrader (Oregon). Representatives Kathleen Rice (New York), Stephanie Murphy (Florida), and Lou Correa (California) are co-sponsors.\n \n \nTheir new bill would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but without international referencing or availability of Medicare-negotiated prices in the commercial market, and restricted to a very limited set of drugs: Physician-administered drugs (Part B) that are no longer are protected by exclusivity or patents, yet do not face competition.\n \n \nSurely, Medicare Part B is a good place to start. \u00a0In 2018, Medicare spent approximately 35% on drugs, biologics, and vaccines. And, from 2009 through 2018, Part B drug spending grew at an average annual rate of 12%. But, the bill\u2019s scope is quite narrow. There are precious few off-patent and off-exclusivity injectables of note that have no competition. Moreover, regarding the lowering of drug prices in the narrower band of eligible drugs, the bill would only allow Medicare to negotiate price concessions of up to 35%.\n \n \nThe bill leaves Medicare Part D (outpatient drugs) prices untouched, but does set an out-of-pocket maximum cap on spending by beneficiaries based on a sliding scale. The scale is anchored by income as a percentage of the federal poverty level; the lower an individual\u2019s income the lower the cap. Importantly, the bill also imposes a $50 out-of-pocket maximum on insulin per month.\n \nThe proposed legislation by the five House Democrats was clearly designed to counter legislation backed by the Democratic leadership that would allow price negotiation by Medicare on a much wider range of drugs.\n \nSpecifically, H.R. 3 would empower the Health and Human Services Secretary to directly negotiate prices for at least 25 of the top-selling 250 drugs, starting in 2024; and 50 drugs in 2025 and beyond. These are brand-name drugs that do not have two or more generics or biosimilars on the market. The maximum price of each drug would be set at 120% of the average of the price paid in Australia, Canada, U.K., France, Germany, and Japan. Medicare-negotiated prices would be permitted to permeate into the commercial market. In addition, Medicare would levy steep fines on drug companies that don\u2019t participate in the negotiation process or abide by the agreed-on price, namely a 65% excise tax on annual gross sales of each drug.\n \nBut, in late September, Representatives Peters and Schrader kept a key House committee from advancing drug pricing legislation that was largely patterned after H.R. 3.\n \nPassing comprehensive drug pricing reform was never going to be easy sledding.\n \nLast week, in a desperate attempt at winning the support of centrist Democrats, Senator Wyden purportedly promised to carve out exceptions for small biotechnology companies that are considered important from an innovation and value standpoint. Presumably this means these companies would not be subject to price control measures.\n \nBut, operationally this seems to be a non-starter. What counts as small? How is innovativeness or value defined? And, who does the defining? Of course, this also raises the question whether it\u2019s sensible to carve out companies rather than products. Whether a drug is innovative and has value is not a function of the kind of company that makes it. Large biopharmaceutical firms can make innovative, valuable products just as well as small biotechnology companies.\n \nIn this context, a larger question looms regarding whether drug pricing reform will address alignment of price and value. Except for the White House plan, which alludes to testing of small-scale, mandatory models using value-based payments in Medicare Part B, none of the bills strive to align price and value, other than through arbitrarily determined price cuts.\n \nCertainly, charging high prices for drugs with marginal benefits is problematic. But, the problem isn\u2019t solved systematically by arbitrary, across the board price cuts. Ultimately, any substantive package of drug pricing reform measures will have to make a concerted effort to match drug prices with the benefits they confer, assessed independently through a publicly accountable process. \n \nIndirect measures - as outlined in the bill drafted by Peters and colleagues - such as requiring drug manufacturers to explain price increases of existing drugs and high prices of newly launched products drugs, beat around the bush. They fail to speak directly to the disconnection between price and value. \n \nFor those hoping for some drug price measures not all is lost, however, as the budget reconciliation bill may incorporate elements of overlap between H.R. 3 and the centrist bill. This includes the possibility of instituting inflationary rebates for existing Medicare Part B and D drugs, which implies that if drug makers raise prices above a certain inflation index, they\u2019ll have to refund government the difference. It\u2019s also probable that the budget reconciliation bill will aim to bolster competition in the marketplace by banning pay for delay (paying off generics firms who promise to refrain from competing) and curbing abuses of the exclusivity and patent system.\n \nPerhaps the budget reconciliation bill will also decrease beneficiary out-of-pocket costs by targeting the rebate system, which is laden with perverse incentives. Rebates are cash payments made by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers (and payers) in exchange for moving market share towards particular products. Basing beneficiary cost-sharing on the post-rebate price of a drug rather than the original list price would effectively force the pass-through of rebates to patients. In turn this would lead to a reduction in the out-of-pocket cost burden incurred by patients.\n \nThe internal clash among Democrats raises the level of uncertainty with respect to the kinds of drug pricing measures that will be included in the budget reconciliation bill. Though certain modest courses of action are likely, the chances of comprehensive drug pricing reform resulting in deep price cuts have diminished.",

It's that simple,\" the Colorado Democrat told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\"\n\nTen people, including a police officer, were killed after a gunman opened fire in a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. The latest attack -- one of at least six mass shootings so far this year -- has shaken a community and stoked calls for action from Congress.\n\nEarlier this month, the House passed H.R. 8 that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales and H.R. 1146 to try and close what's known as the \"Charleston Loophole,\" which allows some firearms to be transferred by licensed gun dealers before the required background checks are completed.\n\nCrow told CNN that it's now up to the Senate to act on the two bills. Senate Democrats have vowed to bring the background check bill to the floor despite the uphill climb ahead to garner the 60 votes needed to bring a potential filibuster.\n\nAsked by Berman if it would be worth getting rid of the Senate filibuster to pass the legislation, Crow replied, \"Yes.\" \"Nobody can ever say that any one law or policy will prevent a specific shooting. I've never heard anybody ever say that passing common-sense gun violence prevention legislation is going to prevent every shooting and is going to make us perfectly safe. That's not true,\" Crow told CNN. \"But it will make us a lot safer. When we have almost 40,000 Americans die a year because of gun violence, there is a tremendous amount of room for improvement.\" Crow added that as a lawmaker, his job \"is to try to make better policy, to make people's lives better, to help make people safe. And they deserve my action.\" The suspect in the Boulder shooting is in custody, but authorities have not shared any information on his identity, the type of weapon used or any possible motive. The fatal shooting on Monday in Colorado also comes less than a week after shooting attacks at three spas in the Atlanta area left eight people dead.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a podcast released Tuesday, argued Democrats are trying to use the levers of power to give them a long-term political advantage\u00a0despite the fact they hold the slimmest of majorities in both the House and Senate.\u00a0\u00a0\nMcConnell spoke on the conservative \"Ruthless\" podcast, where he\u00a0assailed Democrats over their planned bills on elections, H.R.1 and S.1; attempts to add new states to the Union; efforts to remove the legislative filibuster\u00a0and more.\u00a0\n\"They want to change the system to benefit themselves and they want to have instead of a referee they want the FEC to be a prosecutor,\" McConnell, R-Ky., said, referencing HR.1 and S.1.\u00a0\nDEMOCRATS DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM PREVIOUS PRO-FILIBUSTER STANCE, CITING GOP OBSTRUCTION\n\"So this is not about anything other than trying to help the Democrats win elections in perpetuity,\" he added.\u00a0\n\n      Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky walks toward the Senate floor on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n      \n\n\nDemocrats have framed H.R.1 and S.1 as key voting rights legislation aimed at increasing access to the polls and curbing corruption.\u00a0\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said S.1 would \"combat all of these voter suppression efforts by restoring critical parts of the Voting Rights Act... make it easier\u2014not harder\u2014to vote by automatically registering American voters when they get a driver\u2019s license...[and] limit dark money and corruption in our politics, and much more.\"\nBut McConnell on \"Ruthless\" Tuesday framed it\u00a0as a partisan power grab.\u00a0\n\"We\u00a0had record turnouts last year...\u00a0So this is not to drive up turnout, turnout's already driven up,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\"It's to take over the Federal Election Commission so it can be a prosecutor. It's to provide public funding for elections. It's to provide the same-day registration, which I just looked at a survey that said something \u00a081% of the Amerian people are concerned about something like that leading to vote\u00a0fraud.\"\nHe added: \"It's about eliminating voter ID at the polls, which the American people support 72-25. It also mandates what's called\u00a0ballot harvesting, that is going around and picking up ballots of other people. The American people, when that's explained to 'em, oppose it 83-16.\"\n\n      Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praises his Democratic Caucus at a news conference just after the Senate narrowly approved a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Saturday, March 6, 2021. One of the next major pieces of legislation the Senate will consider is S.1, a bill that would dramatically expand federal oversight of state elections, which Schumer supports. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n      \n\n\n20 STATE AGS DENOUNCE DEMOCRATS HR1 AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nOne provision that McConnell specifically cited was the fact that S.1 and H.R.1 would reduce the number of members on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) from six, including three from each party, to five. In the new model, there would be two members from each major political party and a fifth who is required to be unaffiliated with either\u00a0but would be appointed by the president.\u00a0\nDemocrats say this is necessary because of dysfunction at the FEC, but McConnell said it is simply aimed at making the commission more partisan in favor of Democrats.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Senate Rules and Administration Committee is holding a hearing on S.1 on Wednesday, which is likely to be a combative airing of grievances. Republicans are expected to rail against the bill as a partisan effort to gain an electoral edge while Democrats are likely to accuse Republicans of being against efforts to make it easier to vote.\u00a0\nMcConnell also said Democrats are trying to solidify their power in the Senate by adding Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., as states -- with two senators each -- \"to be able to get what [they]\u00a0want all the time.\" To do that, he continued, Democrats are aiming to get rid of the legislative filibuster that lets a minority of 41 or more senators stop a bill from getting to a final vote.\u00a0\nA SECOND HOUSE DEMOCRAT OBJECTS TO OVERTURNING IOWA CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION GOP WON BY SIX VOTES\n\"These folks are not interested in compromise,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\"They're interested in passing all of their bills to remake America in spite of the mandate that they did not get last year, as rapidly as possible. And the filibuster is what prevents that. So it looks like we're down to two brave Democrats -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, preserving the institution.\"\n\n      Rep.-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, won Iowa's Second Congressional District by six votes and flipped the seat from blue to red.\n      (Mariannette Miller-Meeks campaign)\n\n\nSome Democrats, meanwhile, say the filibuster needs to be removed because\u00a0of Republican obstruction -- despite the fact there has not been one instance of Republicans invoking a legislative filibuster this year.\u00a0Democrats passed their coronavirus stimulus package using budget reconciliation, which bypasses the filibuster.\u00a0\n\"Today, nearly 65 years after Strom Thurmond\u2019s marathon defense of Jim Crow, the filibuster is still making a mockery of American democracy. The filibuster is still being misused by some Senators to block legislation urgently needed and supported by strong majorities of the American people,\" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said last week.\nMcConnell also Tuesday on \"Ruthless\" accused Democrats of hypocrisy for aiming to potentially seat a Democrat in place of Rep. Mariannette\u00a0Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who the state certified won her election by six votes.\u00a0\n\"Sounds like they were preaching that in November in December that state\u00a0certification was sacrosanct. I guess it's sacrosanct except when it isn't. Every time I think they can't reach a new low, they do,\" McConnell said. \"They seem to be on the cusp of setting aside a certified winner -- admittedly it was a close election -- and seating the Democrat instead... Hypocrisy is not unheard of in Washington but this is jaw-dropping hypocrisy.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has not committed to unseating Meeks and seating her Democratic opponent, Rita Hart. But she hasn't taken it off the table either. \"There could be a scenario to that extent,\" she said earlier this month.\u00a0\nThe hosts of \"Ruthless,\" including former McConnell Cheif-of-Staff Josh Holmes, also asked the minority leader a set of lighter questions.\nMcConnell dodged one of them, refusing to choose which is his favorite distillery in Kentucky. But he was willing to choose a favorite among his favorite nicknames, which over the years have included the \"grim reaper\" and \"cocaine Mitch.\"\n\"My favorite was Darth Vader,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\"I revere all of my nicknames but Darth Vader was my favorite\"\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

If it is reported out of committee, the legislation will receive its first floor vote since former Democratic Rep. John Conyers first introduced it in 1989.\n   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the lead sponsor of the current bill, H.R. 40, described it as \"enabling legislation to address the deep-seated racism and historic and systemic elements of mistreatment of African Americans through the centuries.\" \n   \"We think it will be cleansing for this nation, and we think that it will be a step moving America forward to see us debate this question on the floor of the House,\" the Texas Democrat said.\n      The bill would create a 13-member commission that would study the effects of slavery and racial discrimination, hold hearings and recommend \"appropriate remedies\" to Congress.\n   Lawmakers who support the legislation say that it has more support than ever, and that today's descendants of slaves continue to suffer from the lingering legacy of slavery and persistent racial inequities.\n   \n   \n\n   \"Understanding that the compounding nature of racism has created a dynamic where Black people today must not only grapple with living in a country built on our sustained oppression, but also observe the modern manifestations in our daily lives,\" said New York Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who cited the racial wealth gap as well as COVID-19 as examples.\n   Some proponents of the legislation acknowledge that it would be challenging to get it passed in the Senate, given the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster and Democrats' narrow majority. The bill is likely to face Republican pushback in both the House and the Senate.\n   During a hearing on the legislation, Utah Republican Rep. Burgess Owens argued \"it is impractical and a nonstarter for the United States government to pay reparations.\"\n   \"It is also unfair and heartless to give Black Americans the hope that this is a reality,\" said Owens, who is Black.\n      After the House held a hearing on the issue in 2019, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rejected the idea, arguing that it would be \"hard to figure out whom to compensate.\"\n   \"I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea,\" McConnell said then. \n   \n   \n\n   Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, the chair of a House Judiciary subcommittee, said Monday that \"the Senate is not a good place to be with this legislation, or with any legislation that's progressive and advances interests of African Americans, in particular.\"\n   \"You've got to have 10 Republicans right now,\" he added, \"and there are not that many of them that are going to quit and not run again, and going to have a come to Jesus moment.\"\n   The White House has said that President Biden supports a reparations study, but has not yet said whether Biden would sign the bill, should it pass Congress.\n   \"I said he would support a study and he certainly would,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a February briefing when pressed on the issue. \"And we'll take a look if there's legislation that is passed by Congress.\"\n   Asked whether she had received indications from the White House that Biden would sign the legislation, Jackson Lee, the bill's lead sponsor, said that the White House \"has indicated their receptiveness to the commission that would study reparations.\"\n   \"For that reason,\" she said, \"we are going to continue to work and get the bill to that point where it could be signed by the president. And at this time, we have no reason to think anything to the contrary.\"",

In actuality, the bill restores voting rights to convicted felons, protects illegal aliens, and empowers the federal government to grab election oversight from states.\n\nRepublicans have warned the bill represents a potential disaster for the country, saying the country\u2019s electoral process will experience unprecedented chaos if it passes the Senate. (The House has already passed the bill.)\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, a slew of Hollywood stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks has\u00a0already voiced their support for the bill via an initiative from former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nNow more Hollywood stars are contributing to the pressure campaign. Filmmaker Judd Apatow is urging his fans to pressure their senators into voting for the bill, promoting an initiative from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nVeep and Seinfeld star Julia Louis-Dreyfus echoed the call from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nDesperate Housewives star Eva Longoria also urged her fans to support the NAACP\u2019s effort to back the bill.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, actress-comedian Amy Schumer created a video\u00a0promoting the H.R.1 bill, claiming, \u201cyou hate democracy\u201d if you don\u2019t find the sweeping election measure \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\nDebra Messing promoted Amy Schumer\u2019s video message, adding that the bill \u201cprotects our democracy.\u201d\n\nRob Reiner singled out Sen.

Joyce Beatty, the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; Philonise Floyd, an activist and George Floyd's brother; high-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump; and other politicians and civil rights leaders. \"This nation has a moral obligation to make sure that every citizen has full voting rights,\" said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \"Anything short of that is a true threat to our democracy.\" Before the rally, a group of activists started chants to draw attention to the death of Fred Cox Jr., an 18-year-old Black man fatally shot by a sheriff's deputy at a funeral last year in High Point, North Carolina: \u201cFred should not be dead.\u201d Meanwhile, hundreds more were expected to attend the Make Good Trouble Rally in Washington, D.C. on the 58th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington to support restoring voting rights, granting D.C. statehood, ending mass incarceration, and reimagining public safety amid a year of nationwide protests against systemic racism in policing. March On for Voting Rights called on Congress to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act (H.R. 4) and the For the People Act (H.R. 1). \"These bills are incredibly essential to ensure that we have access to the ballot,\" said Stasha Rhodes, campaign manager of 51 for 51, an advocacy group for Washington, D.C., statehood and one of the march's organizers. Follow my colleague Matt today too as he covers the Make Good Trouble rally on the other side of the mall! https://t.co/n7JnvGPS30 \u2014 Cady Stanton (@cady_stanton) August 28, 2021 The marches oppose almost 400 bills in 48 states that organizers say \"amount to shameful, outright voter suppression,\" according to the event website. At least six bills in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma shorten windows to apply for mail-in ballots, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy nonprofit that tracks voter suppression legislation . Bills in Iowa and Montana call for reducing polling place availability. Georgia and Iowa bills seek to limit voting days and hours. Other bills, many of which have already been signed into law, ban ballot drop boxes and mail-in voting, impose harsher voter ID requirements and prohibit giving water to voters in line.Advocates say these efforts target Black voters and other voters of color, who have faced voter suppression throughout U.S. history. \"There's relics of the Jim Crow past that we see in these laws and its efforts to prevent the voter turnout of Black and brown communities,\" Rhodes said. Johnson urged protesters to spend time reflecting on the work of civil rights leaders of the past and to know that the fight for voting rights is not a new battle. He added that marching is not the final step in creating change and that attendees should also contact their local representatives and organize within their own communities. \"Freedom is a constant struggle,\" he said. \"We have to protect it. We need to speak loudly, in unison, just like those before us did.\" Contact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.",

Subscribe today. arrow-right Heritage Action for America, a conservative group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, is spending $750,000 on television ads in Arizona targeted at convincing two Democratic senators \u2014 Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly \u2014 to vote against an elections bill called S.B. 1. A virtually similar bill, H.R. 1, has already passed the House of Representatives on a party-line vote . The bill, among its provisions, would create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting. Both senators are co-sponsors of the companion Senate legislation, so the odds are slim that the ad will have an effect. (The ad also looks like it was produced with a minimal budget.) But perhaps it might convince voters that the Democrats are supporting what the ad calls a \u201cpartisan power grab.\u201d A number of statements are made in the ad, but for the purposes of this fact check, we are going on focus on the ad's claim that the bill is designed to allow undocumented immigrants to vote \u2014 a charge that would have particular resonance in a border state. The Facts The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 , commonly known as the \u201cmotor voter law,\u201d made it possible for state motor vehicle agencies and social-service agencies to register voters. The proposed law would implement what is known as Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) at motor-vehicle agencies, government agencies and public universities. Noah Weinrich, press secretary for Heritage Action, cited a critical report issued by the Heritage Foundation concerning H.R.1. The report claimed that the bill's requirement that states automatically register individuals from state and federal databases, such as state Departments of Motor Vehicles, \u201cwould register large numbers of ineligible voters, including aliens.\u201d Weinrich also cited an article by Hans von Spakovsky, a Heritage senior legal fellow, that criticized as \u201cbiased\u201d a CNN fact check of former vice president Mike Pence attacking the bill. \u201cThe complex sections of HR 1 on automatic voter registration require numerous state and federal agencies to send information on individuals to state election officials so they can be registered,\u201d Spakovsky wrote. \u201cMany state and federal agencies don't have citizenship data on the individuals they deal with.\u201d He added that \u201cHR 1 specifically states that no alien can be \u2018prosecuted under any federal or state law' or \u2018adversely affected in any civil adjudication concerning immigration status or naturalization' due to being automatically registered.\u201d While Heritage makes this sound nefarious, as of February, automatic voter registration has already been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia, so over a third of Americans live in jurisdictions that have either passed or implemented AVR, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law . In this legislative cycle, 39 states have introduced legislation to implement or expand automatic registration. \u201cAVR makes voter registration \u2018opt-out' instead of \u2018opt-in' \u2014 eligible citizens who interact with government agencies are registered to vote or have their existing registration information updated, unless they affirmatively decline. Again, the voter can opt-out; it is not compulsory registration,\u201d a Brennan Center report says. \u201cSecond, those agencies transfer voter registration information electronically to election officials instead of using paper registration forms. These common-sense reforms increase registration rates, clean up the voter rolls, and save states money.\u201d As an example of the potential pitfalls of AVR, Weinrich pointed to an issue that California had in 2018 when it implemented an AVR program through the Department of Motor Vehicles, resulting in thousands of erroneous registrations, including at least one involving a noncitizen. It turned out there was a programming flaw that caused the system to mix up records, officials said at the time. The registrations were canceled and any vote-by-mail ballots, if issued, were suspended. The computer glitch was quickly detected, contained and corrected. Since 2018, records show , California has registered 2.2 million new voters through the DMV and re-registered 4.8 million voters \u2014 and more than 7 million Californians have opted out of voter registration. \u201cIt's remarkable how few of the states that have AVR actually experienced these types of glitches,\u201d said Wendy Weiser , who directs Brennan's Democracy Program. In any case, registration of an ineligible voter is already a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison ( 52 U.S. Code \u00a7 20511 ). It is also unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate in federal office ( 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 611 Peter Whippy, communications director for the House Administration Committee, pointed to several items in H.R. 1's text that provide safeguards to ensure ineligible people are not registered to vote. H.R. 1 requires every state to implement an automatic voter registration system, but the bill continually makes it clear that only citizens are eligible to be registered. H.R. 1 also requires eligible voters to affirm that they are U.S. citizens before they are added to the voter rolls. Sec. 1012(c) : [One-time Registration of Voters Based on Existing Contributing Agency Records] State officials are required to provide applicants with the following: \u201cthe substantive qualifications of an elector in the State \u2026 \u201d as well as \u201cthe consequences of false registration, and a statement that the individual should decline to register if the individual does not meet all those qualifications.\u201d Sec. 1012(c): [One-time Registration of Voters Based on Existing Contributing Agency Records] also provides that state officials must send written notice to each individual \u201cof the individual's voter registration status,\u201d keeping them apprised of their status and thus able to change their status should they so desire. Sec. 1013: [Contributing Agency Assistance in Registration] provides that \u201ceach contributing agency that (in the normal course of its operations) requests individuals to affirm United States citizenship (either directly or as part of the overall application for service or assistance) shall inform such individual \u2026 \u201d of the \u201csubstantive qualifications\u201d required to vote, and that they will be registered to vote unless they decline to register or are found ineligible. As for the provision cited by von Spakovsky, Whippy said that is intended to provide \u201ca safe harbor for any immigrants inadvertently being added to the voter rolls due to a similar state error and avoid potential deportation or adverse legal action through no fault of their own.\u201d Weiser said that in the states that have implemented AVR, it had proved to be more reliable and error-free than relying on people's own assertions that they are eligible to vote. That's because agencies often already have information on whether a person is eligible to vote, she said. The Pinocchio Test In this ad, Heritage Action has taken a somewhat remote possibility that undocumented immigrants would be registered as voters under AVR and turned it into a Democrat desire \u2014 that they \u201cwant to register illegal aliens.\u201d First of all, it's against the law for noncitizens to vote. Second, the proposed law contains numerous safeguards to prevent that from happening \u2014 safeguards that would not be in place if Democrats really planned to enlist noncitizens as voters. Heritage Action can point to only one example when an AVR system inadvertently signed up people not eligible to vote \u2014 a computer glitch in 2018 that was quickly discovered and corrected, with the registrations canceled. Since then, no other such problems have emerged in California. If Heritage had made the case that undocumented immigrants might inadvertently be registered, despite the proposed safeguards, this might have been a Three Pinocchio claim. Errors are always possible with new systems. But claiming, without evidence, that Democrats want to enlist illegal voters tips this claim to Four Pinocchios.

    "body": "The Biden administration threw its support behind statehood for Washington, DC on Tuesday,\u00a0bucking previous Democrat administrations\u2019 legal determinations of unconstitutionality.\n\nThe\u00a0Office of Management and Budget, under Acting Director Shalanda Young (pictured),\u00a0issued a statement, reading in part, \u201cFor far too long, the more than 700,000 people of Washington, D.C. have been deprived of full representation in the U.S. Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis taxation without representation and denial of self-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded,\u201d it reads.\n\n\u201cEstablishing the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth as the 51st state will make our Union stronger and more just,\u201d it continued.\n\n\u201cWashington, D.C. has a robust economy, a rich culture, and a diverse population of Americans from all walks of life who are entitled to full and equal participation in our democracy \u2026 The Administration strongly supports H.R. 51,\u201d it concludes before calling on Congress to act swiftly and \u201corderly\u201d to do so.\n\nBreitbart News reported\u00a0legal scholars and two Democrat administrations have opposed \u201cD.C. statehood\u2019s feasibility without a Constitutional amendment to the 23rd Amendment. The Office of Legal Counsel in 2007\u00a0believed\u00a0it was unconstitutional,\u00a0the Justice Department under former President Reagan and former President Carter\u00a0stated\u00a0the transformation was unconstitutional, and so did Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, when he sat on the\u00a0D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nNot only that, \u201cTwenty-two state Attorneys General have\u00a0sent\u00a0a letter to President Joe Biden and Congress arguing Washington, D.C., cannot transition into a state via legislation, but only through the method of a Constitutional amendment,\u201d Breitbart News reported. According to the Heritage Foundation, the primary arguments against D.C. statehood\u00a0are: Our nation\u2019s capital was always meant to be unique.\u00a0The Framers established in the Constitution\u2019s District Clause that the nation\u2019s capital is a federal district, existing beyond the borders or influence of any state. H.R. 51 is doubly unconstitutional, violating both the plain meaning of the District Clause as well as the necessary implications of the Twenty-Third Amendment. Even those who support D.C. statehood admit district residents enjoy special benefits due to where they live and would enjoy an outsize influence in Congress.\n\nThe full House vote on the legislation was scheduled for Tuesday but was moved to Thursday when\u00a0House Majority Leader\u00a0Steny Hoyer\u00a0(D-MD) tweeted, \u201cI expect to bring #HR51 to the House Floor for a vote on Thursday, April 22 to grant #DCStatehood to the more than 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia. The voice of every American citizen deserves to be heard \u2013 it\u2019s past time that we make statehood a reality for DC.\u201d\n\nThe House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY),\u00a0voted\u00a0the bill out of committee by a vote of 25-19 on April 16.",

    "body": "a jubilant, though complicated, moment of freedom from chattel slavery. As a nation, we have yet to fully reckon with the legacy of slavery and ongoing systemic racism. Commemoration of events both joyous and tragic is woven into the fabric of Jewish faith and tradition. Our Jewish calendar is replete with holidays marking events both joyous (the miraculous oil that lasted for eight nights remembered each Hanukkah ) and tragic (the destruction of the ancient holy temples remembered on Tisha B'Av just this month). The account of our ancestors' enslavement and exodus from Egypt is not only retold at the annual Passover seder, but also inspires the Torah's most often repeated commandment to treat the stranger in our midst as one of our own, for we too were once strangers. Our history is not relegated to the past, but rather remains present within our daily lives and rituals, inspiring a vision of justice. These traditions hold a lesson for our nation: To build a truly liberated society, we must use the power of collective memory to learn about, reflect upon and confront our 400-year-long history of slavery and systemic racism. If we wish to redeem the soul of America, our efforts at earnest truth-telling must result in equally serious attempts to provide redress for past and ongoing harms. This is why we, as leaders in the Reform Jewish Movement, are calling for Congress to pass H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act RELATED: Reparations bill gains momentum as an interfaith cause H.R. 40 would create a federally funded commission to study the history and devastating impacts of slavery and systemic racism, including federal and state governments' roles, and to recommend appropriate remedies for these past and ongoing harms. Jewish tradition also reminds us that simply remembering the past is not sufficient to create a future free of oppression. The Exodus narrative recounts that when the Israelites left Egypt, \u201cthey asked of the Egyptians silver items and gold items, and clothing. And God gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they asked; so they emptied out the Egyptians\u201d (Exodus 12:35-36). In other words, when the Israelites were liberated from slavery, they were given some of the wealth their slave labor had created. In this manner, Jewish tradition recognizes material redress for the enslavement and oppression of the Israelites was a necessary step in their ultimate liberation. This principle is not limited to the Exodus narrative. The book of Deuteronomy instructs \u201cwhen you set them (indentured servants) free, do not let them go empty-handed. Surely furnish them\u201d (Deuteronomy 15:13-14). At the heart of our vision for liberation sits the principle that a just response to oppression requires reparative action. Where Jewish tradition sets forth the importance of redress for past harms, recent history affirms these ancient values. Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and, in some cases, their direct descendants continue to receive reparations from Germany. Likewise, Japanese Americans have received reparations from the United States government for the harms of their internment during World War II. Much of the United States' wealth \u2014 in the South and North alike \u2014 is built upon the legacy of chattel slavery and ongoing systemic racial oppression of African Americans. Every American, no matter our race, background or how long we or our families have lived in this country, is impacted by these shameful legacies. Yet, due to institutionalized systemic racism throughout society, Black Americans have paid and continue to pay a steeper price across every socioeconomic measure, from maternal mortality to education outcomes to lifetime earnings. Simply put, Black Americans are disproportionately poorer than white Americans. Black Americans also live, on average, nearly six years less than their white counterparts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RELATED: Faithful Black descendants hope reparations after Florida massacre will be a model As a multiracial Jewish community, we believe H.R. 40 is in all of our interest. For Black Jews, certainly there is a debt that is owed. And for all of us who have benefited from the legacy of slavery, it is long past time to begin to repair the harm slavery and ongoing systemic racism have caused. Our Jewish tradition reminds us each day that only through hard truth-telling and reparative action can the long-festering wounds of historic experiences be addressed. The same is true of our collective American experience marked by 400 years of slavery and systemic racism. We need reparations now. We cannot wait any longer.

    "body": "a major legislative priority for Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), which supports its reintroduction in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The act was formerly introduced during the 116th Congress as S. 3393 and H.R. 5995.Under current law, when service members retire from the military, they are entitled to retired pay from the Department of Defense (DoD) and disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) if they were injured during service. However, only military retirees with at least 20 years of service and a disability rating of at least 50% can collect both benefits simultaneously. For all other retirees, there is a dollar-for-dollar offset of these two benefits, meaning they must forfeit a portion of the benefits they earned in service.The Major Richard Star Act would reform this policy to ensure 42,000 retirees whose military careers were cut short due to combat-related injuries can collect hundreds of dollars per month that they have been denied up until now.\"We must honor all wounded warriors who served our country, whether their injuries occurred in combat or during combat-related training,\" said Aleksander Morosky, WWP government affairs specialist. \"Regardless of the time spent in service, these veterans have earned all their benefits through their extraordinary sacrifices in defending our nation, and no retiree should be subject to the offset. Wounded Warrior Project will continue to support legislation to eliminate the offset for all retirees and considers the Major Richard Star Act one step toward achieving that goal. We're grateful to Senators Jon Tester (D-MT) and Mike Crapo (R-ID), as well as Representatives Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) and Raul Ruiz (D-CA) for their leadership and hard work on getting this critical legislation introduced.\"",

Joe Manchin, who appears to be relishing his role as the lynchpin of virtually every legislative endeavor in the 50-50 divided Senate.\nAt this juncture, it remains unclear how much political capital either Biden or Manchin are willing to devote to gun control at a time when the nation is distracted by the pandemic, vaccine distribution, the economic recovery and Biden's massive infrastructure bill, which is the administration's primary focus at the moment.\nEven when emotions were still running high after the Atlanta and Boulder shootings last month, Manchin made it explicitly clear to CNN that he did not support\u00a0two gun bills\u00a0recently passed by the House \u2014 one, H.R. 8, that would expand background checks on all firearm sales, and a second, H.R. 1446, closing the so-called\u00a0Charleston Loophole\u00a0that allows some licensed gun sales to be completed before a required background check is conducted.\nManchin said he still favored pressing ahead with the\u00a0narrower compromise\u00a0legislation expanding background checks that he crafted with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey after the Sandy Hook massacre. That legislation, which Biden advocated for as vice president, failed in 2013, and the new House-approved bills that Manchin opposes would go farther.\nBeyond Manchin's objections, there is no indication at this point that Democratic senators are on track to win the considerable GOP support they would need to overcome a filibuster on gun legislation\nEarlier this month, Biden harnessed the powers of the presidency to advance a half-dozen\u00a0executive actions\u00a0on gun control, but they fall far short of the ambitious goals he outlined as a presidential candidate as the real fight still looms on Capitol Hill.\nRead more about where things stand in Congress here. \nSee the moment:",

Raphael Warnock (D-GA) expressed outrage over state Republican lawmakers moving to end no-excuse absentee voting, automatic voter registration, and ballot drop boxes, calling the proposals \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is shameful,\u201d the newly-elected senator said of the proposals. \u201cWe need to swiftly pass the For The People Act to strengthen access to the ballot and prevent voter suppression from silencing our voices\u201d:\n\nRepublican state senators in Georgia\u00a0introduced bills Monday targeting a number of controversial voting issues, including no-excuse absentee voting. According to AJC, the measure would limit absentee voting to \u201cthose over 75 years old, voters with disabilities or anyone required to be absent from his or her precinct.\u201d\n\nThe measures also include efforts to ban ballot drop boxes, requiring absentee voters to instead send their ballot in through the mail or deliver it to the country election office. Another proposal would prevent automatic voter registration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to restore confidence in the ballot box,\u201d Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller, who cosponsored the bills, said. \u201cWhen people lose confidence in the ballot box they ultimately lose confidence in their government.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be sure every vote is accounted for, accurate and legal,\u201d he added.\n\nDemocrats, however, contend that the measures amount to voter suppression.\n\n\u201cIf you restrict access, then people get discouraged and they don\u2019t vote. They don\u2019t come back,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler (D) said. \u201cWe have to make the argument that it\u2019s a good process. People were able to vote, and they voted in record numbers.\u201d\n\nThe legislation follows a controversial presidential election and subsequent runoffs, which thrust the Peach State into the spotlight amid the mounting reports and suspicions of irregularities, sowing a sense of distrust among many voters nationwide.\n\nDemocrat lawmakers have been pushing H.R. 1, or the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d which would \u201cnationally mandate automated mailing out of ballots to registered voters for elections while prohibiting states from having photo-ID requirements for ballot submission or signature verification of ballots,\u201d as Breitbart News reported.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) spoke about the proposal in December, warning that the left\u2019s priorities \u201cinclude a national mandate for mail-in voting, legalization of ballot harvesting, and ending photo-ID requirements for voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cH.R. 1, under [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, was a radical election law bill that would have mandated universal mail-out balloting in every state of the union. It would have required states to permit ballot harvesting. It wouldn\u2019t have only prohibited photo identification \u2014 which [is] needful \u2014 it would have prohibited even signature verification,\u201d he told Breitbart News Daily.\n\nDemocrats, again, showed that they remain dedicated to altering U.S. election laws, with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) introducing a bill last week, the \u201cVote at Home Act,\u201d designed to expand \u201cOregon-style\u201d mail-in voting nationwide.",

Phil Scott, a Republican, did not support last year\u2019s measure making universal mail-in voting a temporary reality, he \u201callowed it to become law without his signature, and state Republicans unsuccessfully sued to overturn the law,\u201d as the Hill reported.\n\nCondos is far from the only Democrat official vying to make universal vote-by-mail a permanent staple of U.S. elections. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and\u00a0Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) introduced a bill last week to expand \u201cOregon-style\u201d mail-in voting nationwide. The measure\u00a0would \u201cmassively expand vote-at-home ballot access\u201d and introduce automatic voter registration.\n\nFreshman Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) has also called on congressional Democrats to take decisive action in the form of the \u201cFor The People Act,\u201d in which progressive lawmakers conclude that \u201cStates and localities have eroded access to the right to vote through restrictions on the right to vote including excessively onerous voter identification requirements, burdensome voter registration procedures, voter purges, limited and unequal access to voting by mail, polling place closures, unequal distribution of election resources, and other impediments.\u201d\n\nThe bill would automatically have ballots sent to registered voters and prevent states from having basic photo-ID requirements, among other changes including preventing states from requiring applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security number.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) warned that an election law overhaul remains one of the left\u2019s top legislative priorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tradition that a new House majority reserves its top priority for what they call H.R. 1 \u2014 House Resolution number one \u2014 the very first bill that\u2019s introduced,\u201d Cotton explained during a December appearance on Breitbart News Daily.\n\n\u201cH.R. 1, under Nancy Pelosi, was a radical election law bill that would have mandated universal mail-out balloting in every state of the union.

Supporters of H.R. 1446 claim the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021 closes the \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d by extending the default proceed provision of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).  The misnamed act would do nothing to enhance the background check process, nor would it close the \u201cCharleston loophole.\u201d Instead, it would dramatically dilute the \u201cinstant\u201d intent of the NICS, by extending from three business days to a minimum of 10 business days during which the FBI or a state agency can process the background check.  In the 24 years since the NICS was launched, there have been major advancements in technology for data collection, data management and process engineering. Few, if any, of these advancements have been applied to the NICS.  An aspirational solution would do more than merely stretch the time frame to perform checks within a dated system and incomplete database. To truly enhance the background check process, elected officials should fund programs that will enable states to make accurate, timely updates to the NICS database. The programs should also transform the system so the FBI and state agencies can perform comprehensive and accurate background checks that exclude ineligible buyers from acquiring firearms while preserving the prompt and accurate provision of service to those who are safe and prudent buyers.

    "body": "On November 12, following a speech from retired lieutenant general H.R. McMaster at the Richmond Forum in Virginia, a man says he found himself so inspired that he formed a political committee to support McMaster for president in 2024.\u00a0His mistake? Naming the PAC \"H.R. McMaster for President.\" Federal regulations generally prohibit committees from using the name of a prospective candidate in their committee's name.Then, two days after the McMaster filing, another man filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a committee with completely different \u2014 and hostile \u2014 intentions. The campaign committee is named \"Peter Y. Liu for U.S. Senate 2024 Against Jew Supremacy in America.\" It appears to violate an FEC policy for using obscene language.In the meantime, however, anyone perusing the federal government's latest campaign filings could reasonably conclude that McMaster has launched a run for the presidency \u2014 he most certainly has not \u2014 or come across official documents strewn with hate speech.They're the latest examples in a years-long\u00a0series of shenanigans taking place in one of the federal government's less-traveled corridors. And it may be weeks before federal officials do anything about it.FEC spokesperson Christian Hilland told Insider that the man who created the pro-McMaster committee could fix his situation by amending the filing to make it a \"draft committee.\" This allows someone to use a prospective candidate's name to essentially encourage them to run for office \u2014 and raise money toward that goal.A notable instance of this type of committee: the \"Ready for Hillary\" PAC, which promoted a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign before she formally announced her intentions to run for the White House during the 2016 election.Peter Marcia, the man listed as creating the pro-McMaster committee, could not be reached for comment.As for Liu's antisemitic committee name, the FEC has a process for dealing with that \u2014 but it's a protracted one.FEC commissioners adopted a policy in 2016 to have agency staff flag any political committees that include \"fictional characters, obscene language, sexual references, celebrities (where there is no indication that the named celebrity submitted the filing), animals, or similarly implausible entries\" in their names.The policy in part arose from a rash of bogus presidential candidates \u2014 led by an Iowa teenager who launched the \"Deez Nuts\" presidential campaign, but also including Star Trek Captain\u00a0Jean-Luc Picard,\u00a0Queen Elsa\u00a0from Disney's \"Frozen,\" former Cuban President\u00a0Fidel Castro, Jedi knight\u00a0Obi-Wan Kenobi, and\u00a0Captain Crunch.\u00a0After flagging a suspected sham political committee, the FEC then sends a verification letter to the filer notifying them of potential penalties and asking them to confirm, or amend, their filing.According to previous Insider reporting, if the committee fails to respond within 35 days or withdraws its filings, the FEC labels the committee as \"unverified\" and moves the committee's listing to a \"download-only spreadsheet buried on the FEC's website.\" The FEC may also move to \"administratively terminate\" a committee, as well.As the FEC slowly works to purge hate and fake candidates from its databases, US politicians are also dealing with an influx of imposters on Twitter after its new owner, Elon Musk, implemented new policies regarding verification status.Musk, who took over the social media company in late October, made it so anyone \u2014 not just public figures, celebrities, journalists, and politicians \u2014 can receive the blue verification checkmark on their user profiles for an initial payment of $8.Soon after Musk made this decision, verified accounts were created with the express goal of impersonating past and present US leaders, such as President Joe Biden, Sen. Ted Cruz, Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Sen. Ed Markey.Markey, who collaborated with the Washington Post to highlight how easy it is for anyone to create an account impersonating a public figure on Twitter, later admonished the platform and Musk for \"putting profits over people and his debt over stopping disinformation.\"But it appears that Musk isn't taking the senator's concerns to heart \u2014 the CEO responded by mocking the leader.And with Twitter struggling to moderate its user base and the FEC taking its time to address the validity and content of election filings in its database, it's likely only a matter of time before fake social media accounts intentionally or unintentionally prop up fake candidates for the 2024 election.",

On the podcast, he repeated his threat to do everything possible to slow down legislation if Democrats scrap the filibuster.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they destroy the essence of the Senate, the legislative filibuster, they will find a Senate that will not function. It takes unanimous consent to turn the lights on here and I think they would leave an angry 50 senators not interested and being uncooperative on even the simplest things,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo my point being, it may not be the panacea that they anticipate it would be. It could turn the Senate into sort of a nuclear winter where the aftermath of the so-called nuclear option is not a sustainable place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI revere all of my nicknames but Darth Vader was my favorite,\u201d McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the \u201cRuthless\u201d podcast.Getty Images\n\n\n\nDemocratic advocacy groups are\u00a0putting pressure\u00a0on centrist Sens.

It would allow voters to sign a sworn statement in lieu of presenting a photo ID.\n\n\n\n\nMcConnell criticized Democrats for wanting to add DC as a state through legislation and the less-imminent push for Puerto Rico statehood.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey want to change the makeup of the Senate by admitting two new states, DC and Puerto Rico, to give them in all virtual certainty four new Democratic senators forever,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo you change the makeup of the Senate, you break the rules of the Senate, just to be able to get what you want, all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Senate minority leader said he prefers \u201cDarth Vader,\u201d his 2020 re-election campaign sold \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d merchandise, turning a political foe\u2019s insult into a fundraising opportunity. Failed West Virginia Senate candidate Don Blankenship coined that nickname after the drug was found on a ship owned by McConnell\u2019s father-in-law.\n\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s failed White House budget director nominee Neera Tanden withdrew her nomination after Senate Republicans and some Democrats objected to her litany of social media insults, which included calling the top Republican \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d and \u201cVoldemort.\u201d",

McMaster testified Tuesday evening at the first hearing of the House Select Committee on China\n close\n  Video\n  Former National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Tuesday at the first House Select Committee on China hearing that the next two years could be a \"dangerous period\" for the United States as tensions between China and Taiwan could escalate.\n  During the committee's debut hearing, McMaster warned in his testimony that the U.S. is in a \"difficult position,\" with respect to deterring the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from attacking Taiwan, and that over the next two years, with Taiwan's election and U.S. elections in 2024, could prove to be a \"dangerous period.\"\n  \"We've heard to maybe within the next year or two is the window that Chinese would look to try to take Taiwan,\" Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., remarked to McMaster on Tuesday, nothing that it would be a conflict of a massive scale.\n  \"There's a Taiwanese election in 2024. It's not going to be good, I think, from the view of Xi Jinping,\" McMaster said.\n  \"And then we [have] our own election, which we tend to be sometimes fractious during an election,\" he continued. \"I think he may perceive weakness. If we think of deterrence as capability times will, our capabilities are not where they should be and capacity and their perception, which I don't think is right, but the party's perception of our will I think makes it a dangerous period,\" he added.\n  \"We are in a difficult position because we have been underinvested in modernization for quite an amount of a long amount of time,\" McMaster replied.\n  \"What has happened is the People's Liberation Army studied us. Instead of trying to recreate our some of our exquisite capabilities, they developed countermeasures\u2026,\" he continued.\n  \"We need now, and we've had needed for some time, investments in countermeasures to those countermeasures, but we haven't been able to pull it off,\" he said.\n  We also have problems in capacity at the same time. I think what Xi Jinping sees is a fleeting window of opportunity\u2026 to move while he perceives weakness in the United States,\" McMaster continued.\n  \"It's worth going back and reading the joint statement between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin on the eve of the Beijing Olympics,\" McMaster remarked.\n  \"The message is, \u2018hey, United States, West, free world, you're over. It's a time for a new era of international relations.

She told Breitbart News:\n\nOnce you give them amnesty, the [current illegal] farmworkers are going to leave agriculture. So the growers are going to have to replace that labor force. If the borders are open, they\u2019ll just do it with more illegals. But if they have to use E-Verify [to ensure legal hiring], they\u2019ll hire H-2As and pay them less. So all wages across the industry will go down, or at least be stagnant, and the farm communities will basically empty out more than what has already happened.\u00a0Towns will dry up because local wages for Americans will decline \u2014 and the visa workers will send most of their wages back to their home countries. It will basically be the exacerbation of the rural-to-urban population shift that we\u2019ve already been seeing [nationwide]. Businesses in those [rural] communities will shut down because there won\u2019t be enough consumers. It means that [private-sector] services will diminish because there won\u2019t be enough consumers. Tax receipts will tank, which is why [government-provided] services will decline.\u00a0Drug use will increase.\n\nAccording to Rob Law,\u00a0Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0legislative and regulatory director and\u00a0former\u00a0policy chief of President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, Agriculture amnesty \u201cis a special interest handout \u2026 it\u2019s government-sanctioned serfdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis immigration bill is far more harmful [to rural communities] than any other provision Congress would ever give our rural communities,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nIt completely forecloses on job opportunities for rural Americans. Are they supposed to learn how to code or build solar panels? Their livelihood is in the rural community, and the importation of a permanent foreign workforce will shut them out entirely.\u00a0The [rural] towns\u00a0will eventually collapse. The tax base of citizens will be depleted, while the schools, hospitals, and other public facilities will get overrun by the needs of the foreign-born workforce. Americans will leave, further straining the very limited resources in those communities. The Democratic Party has made it abundantly clear that they are the party of immigration lawlessness, mass legal and illegal immigration, and do not care about the impacts on working Americans. With that being their platform, you would think that every Republican would look very suspiciously upon any immigration proposal that was put forward by the Democrat Party.",

    "body": "Community Corner National Ban On Transgender Athletes In Girls' Sports Passed By U.S. House Panel WASHINGTON \u2013 The bill, H.R. 734, would block transgender girls from competing in school sports consistent with their gender identity. Reply\n\nMarch 9, 2023 WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. House Education and the Workforce Committee early Thursday passed a bill on a party-line vote that would block transgender girls from competing in school sports consistent with their gender identity, a reflection of a broader push in multiple states to curb the rights of transgender student athletes.\n\nThe bill, H.R. 734, introduced by Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, would amend Title IX to require student athletes to compete in sports in accordance with \u201ca person\u2019s reproductive biology and genetics at birth,\u201d with the bill\u2019s language specifically targeting transgender girls. The bill would also make it a Title IX violation for facilities that receive federal funding to allow transgender female athletes to compete in sports designated for women.\n\nAfter a more than 16-hour markup that lasted from Wednesday morning into early Thursday, the legislation passed 25-17. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education program or activities that receive federal funding. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThe sports legislation is part of a national campaign by Republican lawmakers and conservative groups in the states to restrict the rights of people in the LGBTQ community, particularly transgender youth. The chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, said the bill was the Republican Party\u2019s \u201ccommitment to America.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen are not women, women are not men,\u201d she said. \u201cThey certainly shouldn\u2019t compete against each other in any publicly funded arena.\u201d The bill will likely pass a Republican-controlled House, but is expected to die in the Senate, where Democrats have a slim majority. There is currently no Senate sponsor for the bill in this Congress, but in the prior one, Sen. Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, introduced the Senate version of the bill. During the markup, Democrats introduced five amendments, where they argued that several of them would strengthen Title IX, such as protecting athletes\u2019 privacy and providing resources for parents and students to report cases of discrimination. But three out of five of those amendments were blocked from a vote because Foxx and the House parliamentarian ruled that the amendments were outside the scope of the original bill. Small numbers of transgender students\n\nThe top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, said instead of addressing real issues in education such as student mental health, achievement gaps and declining math and science skills, Republicans have \u201cchosen to use our first markup to advance a political agenda by politicizing students\u2019 education, scapegoat some of our most vulnerable students as a cause of inequity in athletics.\u201d Scott, like nearly every Democrat on the committee during the markup, pointed out that transgender students are a small fraction of the population, and even a smaller population when it comes to youths in sports. \"It's ludicrous to suggest that such a handful of athletes, who pose no evidentiary threat, justifies national congressional action.\" \u2013 Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia \"More than 8 million students compete in high school athletics, and more than 480,000 students compete as National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes,\" according to the NCAA.\n\n\"There are currently only 32 transgender athletes who openly compete in college sports,\" Scott said, adding that there are more lawmakers on the committee than college transgender athletes. There are 45 members of the committee. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that such a handful of athletes, who pose no evidentiary threat, justifies national congressional action,\u201d he said. UCLA\u2019s School of Law Williams Institute estimates that there are about 1.6 million people ages 13 and up who identify as transgender in the U.S. Of that population, 300,000 are youth ages 13 to 17 and make up 1.4% of the U.S. population for that age group. \u2018Scapegoating in a cultural war\u2019\n\nDemocrats argued the legislation would harm transgender children. \u201cThis is about scapegoating in a cultural war a group of trans kids and criminalizing their existence,\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, said. \u201cWe are mired in this cultural war created and started by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and trans kids in this war, become mere collateral damage.\u201d Conservative lawmakers and advocates at the state and federal level have seized upon issues pertaining to the LGBTQ community, particularly about gender studies in schools. They have also pushed back on efforts to teach about racism, accusing schools of teaching critical race theory, which is a college-level course of study that is not taught at the K-12 level. It\u2019s resulted in state and local bills passed that place bans on transgender youth from using school facilities, such as bathrooms, that are consistent with their gender identity. Thousands of books from LGBTQ authors or stories that feature LGBTQ characters have been banned in schools. House Republicans did not address any criticism from Democrats that the bill discriminated against transgender athletes. They instead focused on the argument that sports should be separated by biological sex and that this bill would protect girls.\n\nOne Republican, Bob Good of Virginia, said it was a moral issue. \u201cGod does not make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe creates us perfectly unique as individuals, and all of us are either immutably male or immutably female.\u201d Rep. Burgess Owens, a Utah Republican, introduced the only amendment by Republicans, which was a substitute for the bill\u2019s text. The original sponsor of the bill, Steube, did not speak on the issue. Owens, a former professional football player, said sports had a profound impact on him as a student, and he\u2019s seen how sports can have a positive impact on women. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how sports empower the women in my lives, including my five daughters, and have helped shape their character,\u201d Owens said. \u201cI\u2019m sad to think that the same opportunities might not be available in the future.\u201d\n\nHe said that this bill would ensure that girls are protected under Title IX. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, introduced an amendment to change the title of the bill from the \u201cProtection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023\u201d to \u201cThe Stigmatizing Vulnerable Children Act.\u201d \u201cWe need to be exactly clear about what this bill does and what the consequences of this bill would be,\u201d she said, noting that transgender kids have participated in sports for decades. Jayapal said in 2004 the International Olympic Committee Executive Board announced that transgender athletes could compete in the Olympics, and in 2008 her home state became the first state to allow transgender children to compete in sports in accordance to their gender identity. Her amendment was voted down in a voice vote.\n\nReps. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., and Frederica S. Wilson, D-Fla., pushed back on the bill and said it would be harmful to transgender students and would weaponize Title IX. \u201cUnfortunately, these efforts join the wave of anti-trans legislation sweeping the nation, including in my state of Florida,\u201d Wilson said. States with bans So far, 18 states with Republican-controlled state legislatures have banned transgender athletes from competing in sports that are consistent with their gender identity. Those states that have passed bans on transgender youth in sports are Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, Iowa, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana and Mississippi.\n\nSome of those bans have not gone into effect yet and are on hold due to temporary injunctions such as those in Idaho, West Virginia, Indiana, Utah and Montana, where that injunction applies only to bans in higher education and not K-12. Bonamici introduced an amendment which would prohibit institutions of higher education from requiring athletes to provide reproductive and sexual health information, including information about an athlete\u2019s menstrual cycle. \u201cIt is never okay to ask for unnecessary menstrual and reproductive information from women and girls as a basis for determining eligibility for sports,\u201d she said. Foxx said she disagreed with the amendment, because \u201cthis amendment strips out the underlying bill.\u201d Foxx said it was a \u201cradical attempt to erase women.\u201d\n\n\u201cH.R. 734 is about protecting women from discrimination and unfair playing fields,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cThis amendment prevents the achievement of both goals.\u201d Bonamici\u2019s amendment was voted down in a voice vote. The committee also marked up and passed a second bill, H.R. 5, the \u201cParents Bill of Rights Act\u201d introduced by Rep. Julia Letlow, R-La. It also passed on a 25-17 party-line vote. That bill would require public schools to provide materials for parents to review such as books in the school library, curriculum, budgets and teacher. If those schools do not comply, those institutions could lose federal funding. The bill would also limit classwork and books that deal with issues related to race and sex.",

    "body": "The Heritage Foundation exposed 11 of the most revolutionary demands in the Democrats\u2019 so-called Equality Act, which would force Americans to accept the transgender ideology\u2019s far-reaching claim that each person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their inner feelings of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by their measurable biology.\n\nThe paper describes the 11 myths pushed by its progressive supporters \u2014 and then details\u00a0the reality behind the progressive myths.\n\nMyth 1: The Equality Act Simply Punishes Discrimination Against People Who Identify as Gay or Transgender\n\nFact: The Equality Act\u2014introduced as H.R. 5 in the House of Representatives on February 18, 2021\u2014makes mainstream beliefs about marriage, as well as basic biological facts about sex differences, punishable under the law \u2026\n\nFact: The Equality Act guts the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and threatens constitutional freedoms by eliminating conscience protections from the Civil Rights Act. If enacted, H.R. 5 would force employers, medical professionals, educators, and religious organizations to allow men into women\u2019s shelters, pay for or perform sex-change operations, and engage in speech that violates their consciences \u2026\n\nMyth 3: The Equality Act Does Not Expand the Scope of Federal Civil Rights Law\n\nFact: By expanding the definition of \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d under Title II of the Civil Rights Act to include \u201cany establishment that provides a good, service, or program, including a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services,\u201d many more individuals and establishments would, in fact, become liable for discrimination claims, including doctors who do not want to perform abortions \u2026\n\nMyth 4: The Equality Act Is Irrelevant to Abortion\n\nFact: H.R. 5 endangers unborn children. The Equality Act opens the door to taxpayer funding for elective abortions, which the vast majority of Americans oppose, regardless of political affiliation. The bill does not contain any conscience protections for those with moral or religious objections to paying for or performing abortions. It also takes away judicial relief by blocking claims based on the RFRA \u2026\n\nMyth 5: The Equality Act Is Good for Women and Upholds Title IX of the Education Amendments Act, Which Prohibits Sex Discrimination Against Girls and Women\n\nFact: The Equality Act\u2019s changes to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act do not uphold Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act. Gender-identity policies will require biological males to be permitted to participate in female-only activities \u2026\n\nMyth 6: Safety and Privacy in Sex-Specific Spaces Will Not Be Diminished\n\nFact: All single-sex spaces will be open to both sexes under the Equality Act. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity rules to Title III of the Civil Rights Act on \u201cpublic facilities\u201d as well as to public accommodations (Title II) and federal funding (Title VI). This would create a nationwide transgender policy in single-sex facilities \u2026\n\nMyth 7: The Equality Act Treats All Students Fairly, Promotes Inclusion, and Cannot Affect School Curricula.\n\nFact: By adding sexual orientation and gender-identity rules to the Civil Rights Act\u2019s Title IV on \u201cdesegregation of public education,\u201d the Equality Act could pave the way for K\u201312 federal courts to require sexual orientation and gender-identity curricula the same way they required black history curricula \u2026\n\nMyth 8: Doctors Will Not Be Forced to Perform Sex-Change Operations or Prescribe Hormones for \u201cGender Affirmation\u201d\n\nFact: As a result of the expanding definition of public accommodations, as well as changing federal funding requirements, doctors (and counselors) could be punished for treating gender dysphoria according to their own best medical judgment. Even a referral to another doctor could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act \u2026\n\nFact: The Equality Act\u2019s politicization of medicine and education through gender ideology will undermine parental rights. Since most schools will be pressured to comply with sexual-orientation and gender-identity policies, parents will have limited educational choices for their children. Those who do not believe that their daughters should have to compete against biological males in sports \u2026\n\nMyth 10: The Equality Act Helps Children in Need of Foster Homes and Adoption\n\nFact: The Equality Act hurts vulnerable children by punishing faith-based adoption and foster-care agencies that believe that every child deserves both a mother and a father and that children\u2019s bodies should not be irreversibly harmed by hormonal or surgical interventions due to gender dysphoria \u2026\n\nMyth 11: The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, Requires the Equality Act\u2019s Changes to Civil Rights Law\n\nFact: The Equality Act goes far beyond the Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 Bostock ruling. While Bostock invented a misguided theory of sex discrimination in employment law, it did not redefine \u201csex\u201d to include sexual orientation and gender identity \u2026\u00a0Because\u00a0Bostock\u00a0was limited to employment, it said nothing about schools, sports, or medicine. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to all of them.",

    "body": "The bill does not lay out provisions for the shape the reparations would take, whether in the form of direct cash payments or safety net programs. Despite its open-ended design, getting buy-in from enough lawmakers to tee up a floor vote in even one half of Congress is a tall order.\n\nOn a Wednesday press call, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer dodged questions about whether he would bring the bill to the floor and tried to put the onus on Biden, suggesting the president create his own reparations commission. \n\nWhile both parties have been reticent to embrace reparations legislation in the past, the majority of Republicans oppose it. A February POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 60 percent of Democrats support the formation of a committee to study reparations while 74 percent of Republicans oppose it. Many on the right argue that today\u2019s lawmakers should not be held responsible for mistakes of the past, like enslavement. \n\nYet given the ongoing national reckoning on race and systemic racism \u2014 now reignited by the trial of Derek Chauvin and a second high-profile police killing in Brooklyn Center, Minn. \u2014 reparations advocates say now is a prime opportunity to move reparations legislation forward. It currently has 180 co-sponsors in the House, the most ever. And even with Democrats\u2019 slimmed-down House majority, which includes multiple hesitant moderates, it is in its best position yet to pass that chamber. Doing so would mark a major victory for reparations proponents and racial justice advocates alike. \n\n\u201cI don't think that there's any opposition that can get in the way of passing it out of the House,\u201d said Dreisen Heath, a program advocate at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe're very confident.\u201d\n\nBut beyond a House victory, the fate of H.R. 40 \u2014 and its chances of ultimately making it to Joe Biden\u2019s desk \u2014 is bleak. The White House has maintained that Biden supports the study of reparations and Vice President (then-Senator) Kamala Harris co-sponsored companion legislation in 2019. Still, full passage of the bill would require votes from all 50 Senate Democrats and 10 Republicans, who are almost certain to oppose it. \n\n\u201cThe Senate is not a good place to be with this legislation, or any legislation that's progressive and advances the interest of African Americans in particular,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), chair of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, during a Monday press call. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have ten Republicans right now,\u201d Cohen continued. \u201cAnd there are not that many of them that are going to quit and not run again, and have a come-to-Jesus moment.\u201d\n\nRep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah), who is African American, called the legislation \u201ctreacherous\u201d and \u201ctraitorous\u201d during his testimony on Wednesday, suggesting that the disenfranchisement of Black Americans is the fault of failed Democratic policies rather than the legacy of enslavement or systematic disenfranchisement.\n\n\u201cIf you want to pay back the African American community, give us back our history,\u201d Owens said. \u201cWe are not a hapless, hopeless race. We\u2019re just like everybody else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n POLITICO NEWSLETTERS\n\n\nA newsletter exploring how race and identity are shaping politics, policy and power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Judiciary Republicans echoed these complaints during Wednesday\u2019s committee markup. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) argued that Democrats should be solely responsible for paying for the commission, saying that their party was most responsible for policies that disproportionately hurt Black Americans.\n\n\u201cI hope that we won\u2019t compound some horrendous sins by punishing great grandchildren of people that did wrong,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nExplaining the terms of the bill and defining the role of the commission will be crucial to the efforts to get more Republicans on board, Democrats say. The bill\u2019s Senate companion currently has 16 co-sponsors. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), lead sponsor of H.R. 40, said the bill represents in large part an acknowledgment of past harms done, or a \u201cnational apology\u201d to African Americans. She said she expects the commission to identify both the legacy of slavery and specific policy measures that have systematically disenfranchised African Americans.\n\n\u201cWe're committed to establishing this H.R 40 as an enabling legislation to address the deep seated racism, and historic and systemic elements of mistreatment of African Americans through the centuries,\u201d Lee said in a Monday press call. \n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), sponsor of the Senate bill, lauded the House bill's advancement.\n\n\u201cOur nation has not yet fully acknowledged and grappled with the painful legacy of slavery, white supremacy, and systemic racism that tainted this country\u2019s founding and continues to persist in deep racial disparities and inequalities today, Booker said. \"It\u2019s important that we right the wrongs of our nation\u2019s most discriminatory policies that halted the upward mobility of African-American communities for generations, and we cannot truly move forward without first fully documenting the extent of the harms of the past.\"\n\nSome advocates have suggested that the end goal of the legislation \u2014 establishment of a commission to study reparations \u2014 could be more easily achieved through an executive order. \n\nSo far, White House officials have not indicated they're prepared to apply further pressure on Congress. Lee brushed off the suggestion on Monday, underlining her commitment to passing the legislation in both chambers of Congress.\n\n\u201cOur present [White House] leadership also indicated their understanding and support,\u201d Lee said. But we are now on a legislative drive \u2026 any further strategies will be certainly addressed as needed.\u201d \n\nAt the same time, the concept of reparations is gaining traction in some municipalities across the country. Evanston, Ill., became the first city to craft a reparations policy for its residents in March. The plan allocates $10 million over the next ten years in $25,000 housing assistance payments to qualifying descendants of Black Evanston residents who were victims of housing discrimination. While H.R. 40 does not allocate for payments to African Americans, reparations advocates have cited the Evanston plan as one potential model. \n\nHowever, some reparations advocates remain skeptical of a model like Evanston\u2019s, which focuses largely on housing and would not advance the ultimate goal of closing the racial wealth gap.\n\n\u201cCertainly there are ongoing issues that residents bring to their city governments to address harms,\u201d said Kirsten Mullen, a writer and researcher whose work has centered on reparations. \u201cBut they shouldn't be confused with the goals of a national reparations program for Black American descendants of U.S. slavery.\u201d",

The Democrats\u2019 goal is to use the DOJ to increase their chances of staying in power.\n\nWhile Democrats called the measure a compromise, it is anything but.

They have never bothered to explain how asking voters to provide proof of who they are is a form of bigotry, but\u00a0what could be construed as racist is for Democrats to suggest that a certain group of people either do not have valid forms of ID or are not sophisticated enough to figure out how to obtain one.\n\nAdditionally, the Democrats also want to expand ballot trafficking, and they still want to take control away from states and local communities to hand them over to federal bureaucrats.\n\nThis new Democrat proposal is a clumsy and heavy-handed effort to circumvent Supreme Court decisions, state sovereignty, and the will of the people. Following the loss of two high-profile U.S. Supreme Court cases \u2013\u00a0Shelby County v. Holder\u00a0and\u00a0Brnovich v. DNC\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Democrats won\u2019t be deterred even after hearing their ideas are unconstitutional.\n\nFortunately, constitution-defending Attorneys General are prepared once again to defend the rule-of-law, free and fair elections, and the authority of states and localities to run their own elections.\n\nI was proud to lead the efforts that stopped the Democrats\u2019 first attempt at a federal takeover of elections, and I\u2019m honored to champion that effort again as 23 Attorneys General have signed onto a letter I piloted urging Congress to reject this disastrous piece of legislation.\n\nThis mission is core to who we are as a democratic republic: one that has free and fair elections and where the will of the people reigns supreme. This is why, when\u00a0I served as Indiana\u2019s Secretary of State, we implemented voter ID, making it harder to cheat and easier to vote. Since then, other states followed our lead, and Indiana\u2019s voter participation numbers have continued to climb. Commonsense election security works and is widely supported, which is exactly what Democrats are seeking to undermine.\n\nJoe Biden and congressional Democrats failed to sell their federal takeover of elections the first time around because Americans made their voices heard, and I believe Americans will reject this unconstitutional partisan power-grab again.\n\nThe Democrats didn\u2019t design their so-called \u201cJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act\u201d in good faith to protect Americans\u2019 votes or to expand voting access for minorities as they dishonestly claim.\n\nThey designed it for one reason, so that Democrats in Washington could federalize elections, take power away from the states, and make it easier to cheat.\n\nI will gladly go to any court and any mountaintop with other Attorneys General to ensure we can have confidence in our elections again.\n\nTodd Rokita is the 44th Attorney General of Indiana.",

But there has been little concrete evidence they are working to preserve democracy and the rule of law on which their businesses rely. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right Corporate leaders on Wednesday did their best to declare that they really do favor voting rights. NBC News reports : \u201cMore than 150 companies, including PepsiCo, Amazon and Target, threw their support behind updating the Voting Rights Act in a letter released Wednesday. The signatories, all U.S. employers, urged Congress to enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, legislation that would restore a key provision of the 1965 law that was stripped out by the Supreme Court in 2013.\u201d The letter, however, was silent on the rash of Jim Crow laws pushed by Republicans in state legislatures or on whether they would support some version of H.R. 1. This is totally insufficient. While the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act is important, their silence about the ongoing threat of voter suppression and vote manipulation (i.e., the empowerment of partisan players to overturn election results) amounts to enabling these nefarious activities. Story continues below advertisement Voting rights advocates and the White House should encourage corporations to sign a democracy pledge that would include such concrete items as: Supporting the proposed, slimmed-down version of H.R 1/S.R. 1 that Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) offered. Making Election Day a paid holiday. Helping all their employees register to vote. Offering their own business facilities as voting locations. Refusing \u2014 and actually meaning it this time -- to support any politician at any level of government who promotes the big lie of a stolen election or who sought to overturn the election results in 2020. (That would still leave them free to support scores of Republicans in House, Senate and state elections.) Funding public service announcements and lobbying state legislatures in defense of voting rights. Making clear that they would consider state voting laws when deciding to locate new operations. Refusing to commit advertising dollars to social media platforms that do not follow their own guidelines on election disinformation and hate speech. Civil rights groups can recognize companies that sign on and allow them to advertise their seal of approval as good corporate citizens. Civil rights groups can also monitor their performance to make certain they are living up to their obligations. Chief executives who do not embrace their civic obligations should expect public pressure. Consumers should know if they are spending their money on products and services that share their values. Outside civil rights activists, especially Stacey Abrams, should take the lead in drafting the pledge and persuading corporations to sign. However, there is nothing like a face-to-face meeting with the president, followed by a presidential expression of gratitude, to convince corporate leaders to do the right thing. I can almost hear President Biden telling a room full of CEOs, \u201c C'mon folks. Sign the pledge and we all go out to the Rose Garden to show what real patriotism looks like .\u201d There might be no better use of the bully pulpit.",

The measure aims to expand access to the polls, fight partisan gerrymandering and\u00a0set\u00a0up\u00a0new public funding\u00a0for congressional races.\nMORRISEY: This is a very dangerous bill, and\u00a0at its core, this is a major power grab by Congress and by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi. If you look at the Constitution, the Constitution lays out how elections are going to be set forth. There's obviously some role for the federal government in a number of the elections. There's a primary role for the state government. This bill is trying to wipe out a significant amount of the state's role in managing elections. What is that going to do? Number one, it's going to undermine voter ID, which I think is critical, and it helps to reduce fraud. It's in place in 35 states.\n..\nNumber two, it's actually going to limit the state's ability to take inactive voters off the rolls once again, to provide more confidence to the American public that people who shouldn't be voting aren't actually getting to the polls if they're ineligible. And it also will chill free speech. This is welfare for politicians. It should not pass the U.S. Senate.

    "body": "House Republicans effectively named energy policy as their top priority, introducing an energy package known as H.R.1 on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the bill is unlikely to make it past the Democratically-controlled Senate or President Biden, it does lay out the party\u2019s vision for how to improve the country\u2019s energy policies and may be important for its messaging in the years ahead.\n\nThis bill counters President Biden\u2019s attack on our domestic energy, and includes permitting reforms that will speed construction for major infrastructure projects across the country, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said, adding that the bill will also \u201cgrow our economy\u201d and \u201cstrengthen our national security.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what the bill would do if it were to pass:\n\nBolster fossil fuels\n\nThe Republican bill contains several provisions aimed at boosting the production and sales of oil and gas.\n\nFor public lands, it requires the Interior Department to hold at least four annual sales per state in at least nine states for oil and gas drilling rights.\n\nIt also would reduce the royalty rate that companies that drill offshore need to pay to the government from at least 16.67 percent down to 12.5 percent. It would also require the Interior Department to release its next five-year plan for offshore oil leasing by no later than July 1.\n\nThe legislation would seek to limit the president\u2019s authority to block crossborder energy projects like the Keystone XL pipeline blocked by Biden. Instead it gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Energy Department jurisdiction over cross-border pipeline and electricity transmission approval, respectively. And it would get rid of state authority to block projects like pipelines or gas export terminals that run through their waters.\n\nIt would also bar any kind of pause on fracking \u2013 an oil and gas extraction method that has become controversial for its potential health and environmental effects, including being linked to increased childhood cancer rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bill also seeks to make it easier to sell U.S. liquified natural gas abroad by getting rid of the need for Energy Department approval for export applications for countries where the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a free trade agreement.\n\nPermitting reform\n\nThe bill contains provisions aimed at speeding up the nation\u2019s approval process for permits for energy and infrastructure projects.\n\nIt would set two-year time limits for conducting a more-stringent type of environmental review known as an environmental impact statement for major projects. These reviews would also be limited to 150 pages, except for extraordinarily complex projects, where the reviews would have a 300-page maximum.\n\nLess-stringent reviews, known as environmental assessments, would be limited to one year and 75 pages.\n\nA 2020 White House review found that the average environmental impact statement was 575 pages, while the median was 397.\n\nThe bill would also require anyone wishing to challenge a project\u2019s approval to do so within 120 days.\n\nBoost mining\n\nThe legislation contains a provision that would require an assessment of the potential impacts to the mineral supply chain, including economic and national security implications, before the Interior Department can bar mining on parcels of federally-owned land.\n\nThe bill seeks to make it easier for uranium to join a list of \u201ccritical minerals\u201d that the federal government seeks to prioritize. While uranium was characterized as a critical mineral under the Trump administration, the Biden administration removed it from the list, citing a 2020 law that barred the inclusion of \u201cfuel minerals.\u201d The new legislation would seek to circumvent that hurdle for the mineral\u2019s inclusion.\n\nRepeal Inflation Reduction Act programs\n\nThe bill gets rid of several programs that were passed last year as part of Democrats\u2019 climate, tax and health care legislation.\n\nOne such program aims to reduce planet-warming methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by both providing grants and loans to help companies cut emissions and also issuing fines on excess emissions.\n\nH.R. 1 would also cut funds given to the EPA that would seek to spur funding for climate-friendly projects, especially in disadvantages communities.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0could break a\u00a050-50 tie in Democrats' favor; assuming no Republican sides with the majority.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nScott also argued that Biden was\u00a0wrong to call the new Georgia election law racist, remarking that in North Carolina, a voter ID law actually increased Black participation in recent elections.\n\"So if you want to look at\u00a0whether or not things have an\u00a0impact, let's study the numbers.\u00a0They are not studying the\u00a0numbers,\" he said. \"They are literally on the prowl\u00a0for a liberal takeover of\u00a0everything and then codifying it\u00a0permanently by bringing in new\u00a0states that have the\u00a0overwhelming Democrat approach\u00a0to governing.\"",

McMaster as well as some FBI agents, The New York Times reported on Thursday.\nThe controversial conservative group, led by provocateur and self-styled media watchdog James O'Keefe, dedicates resources to surreptitiously recording government employees, Democratic campaign professionals, and members of the mainstream media.\nMcMaster's background as a general and record in the foreign policy establishment led groups like Project Veritas to derisively designate him as part of the \"deep state\" and his approach to foreign policy as \"globalist\" and at odds with Trump's \"America First\" positioning, The Times said.\u00a0\nWhen Project Veritas was forming its plan to expose and oust McMaster in 2018, Trump was critical of what he described as \"the deep state\" and the law enforcement apparatus that was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0\n\n                          \n                          The idea to go undercover to get McMaster fired from the White House began after a November 2017 article in Buzzfeed News reported that McMaster referred to Trump as an \"idiot,\" \"dope,\" and someone with smarts on par with a kindergardener at a dinner in Washington, DC, The New York Times reported. (McMaster and others present at the event denied that he made such comments at the time).\u00a0\nPer the Times, Project Veritas then devised a plot to have a woman go to the same place, a high-end Italian restaurant called Tosca, with a hidden camera to engage McMaster in conversation and share a few drinks with him in the hope to catch him saying something similarly disparaging about Trump.\nRead more: A Trump prosecution would mean security nightmares in New York, Atlanta, and Washington, DC\nThe Times reported that Project Veritas planned to pay a woman named Tarah Price $10,000 to be the uncover subject, citing emails written by Price's ex-boyfriend to a group called Expose Project Veritas.\u00a0\n\n                          \n                          But the plan became moot when McMaster left the administration of his own volition in March of 2018. He was replaced as National Security Advisor by John Bolton.\u00a0\nProject Veritas reportedly rented out an elaborate six-bedroom house in Georgetown that went for $10,000 a month as the headquarters for the failed operation and also hired women to go undercover on dates with FBI agents to secretly record them in the hopes that some would trash Trump on tape.\u00a0\nThe women hired to bait FBI agents made fake dating app profiles, secretly brought reporting equipment to the dates, were given code names like \"Tiger\" and \"Brazil,\" and were told to keep the location of the house top-secret at all costs, The Times reported.",

I'm tired. I'm so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there ... I'm tired of the moments of silence. Enough.\n\n\"There's 50 Senators right now who refuse to vote on H.R. 8, which is a background check rule that the House passed a couple years ago. It's been sitting there for two years. There's a reason they won't vote on it: to hold onto power.\"\n\nLast year, the House passed H.R. 8 to expand background checks on all commercial gun sales -- the first congressional move on significant gun control since the Democrats won the White House. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers. \"I'm fed up. I've had enough,\" Kerr, whose father was serving as the president of the American University of Beirut when he was assassinated by gunmen in 1984, continued. \"We're going to play the game tonight. But I want every person here, every person listening to this, to think about your own child or grandchild, mother or father, sister, brother. How would you feel if this happened to you today?\" Kerr stands for a moment of silence following Tuesday's mass shooting. Tuesday's shooting by a lone, 18-year-old gunman, who was killed by law enforcement, was the second mass shooting in the US in less than two weeks after a different 18-year-old gunman trafficking in White supremacist theories killed 10 Black Americans in Buffalo. Ahead of Tuesday's game in Dallas, which was preceded by a moment of silence, Warriors guard Damion Lee joined Kerr in calling for gun reform. Tonight we held a moment of silence for those who lost their lives in multiple tragedies in TX. \n\n\n\nWe play tonight's game for Coach Michael Coyne, who lost his life on Sunday returning home from our game, & the victims of the horrific shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. pic.twitter.com/cqMF5RoMbW \u2014 x - Dallas Mavericks (@dallasmavs) May 25, 2022 \"It's just sad,\" Lee told reporters. \"Obviously, everyone saw Steve's pregame presser.

That's unbelievable in this country that we live in.\" The NBA said in a statement that it is \"devastated by the horrific shooting that took place today in Uvalde, Texas,\" while Mavs head coach Jason Kidd said ahead of the game that his team would play \"with heavy hearts.\" \"We're going to try to play the game. We have no choice. The game is not going to be canceled.

    "body": "Washington Democrats, Stacey Abrams and now the Biden administration's\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0have spent months\u00a0spreading lies about the new election laws in Georgia and other Republican-led states.\n\nGeorgia's new election law includes positive election reforms that make sure we have objective measures for absentee ballots and\u00a0for identification of voters, and it will restore confidence in our elections.\n\nBut, aided by a complicit national media amplifying false or misleading attacks as fact, Democrats have\u00a0pushed extreme legislation\u00a0like H.R. 1 that would have violated the Constitution by federalizing elections and undermined the integrity of our election system. Various Democratic proposals would have thwarted states\u2019 voter ID laws\u00a0and\u00a0curtailed Americans\u2019rights to free speech and association. Another extreme bill, H.R. 4, would\u00a0give\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice veto power over\u00a0local election law.\n\nOur own U.S. senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, even offered a possible H.R. 1\u00a0amendment aimed directly at rolling back provisions of Georgia\u2019s new election law. Their mischaracterization\u00a0of Georgia\u2019s law has already done damage,encouraging Major League Baseball to move the All-Star game from the Peach State.\n\nThis is not a new undertaking for congressional Democrats. For years, they havepushed election laws through, leading to a complex labyrinth of laws, rules\u00a0and regulations that make running elections almost impossibly complicated for the county elections officials on the front lines.\n\nGeorgia's secretary of State:Securing elections has overwhelming support among our voters\n\nAs a Republican secretary of state, I\u2019m disappointed that leaders in my party failed to prioritize election reforms \u2013 and to repeal bad Democrat-passed laws \u2013 when they had unified control of Washington just a few short years ago.\n\nWhile they parade around today as warriors for election integrity, they did nothing when they had the chance.\n\nTake the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Motor Voter Act. It prohibits list maintenancefrom occurring 90 days before any federal election. That buffer makes it effectively impossible to conduct list maintenance during an election year, which have both primary and general elections for federal offices.\n\nIn the meantime, the voter rolls get bloated with outdated and obsolete information. Americans are constantly on the move.\u00a0Around 10% move every year.\u00a0In 2019 alone, 284,541 people moved to Georgia while253,565 left.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s pool of eligible voters changes by the tens of thousands every month. Over the course of a year, the damage to the accuracy of the voter rolls snowballs. On paper, this means out-of-state voters remain able to cast ballots in states where they no longer live.\u00a0Voters who move precincts cast ballots for candidates who no longer represent them.\n\nThis is also an integrity issue. California\u2019s former secretary of state and current U.S. senator, Alex Padilla,\u00a0criticized Georgia for planning to remove 100,000 obsolete voter files, but he was forced by a court settlement to remove 1.5 million from California\u2019s rolls after Los Angeles County was found to have a voter registration list 112% the size of its adult citizen population.\n\nThis breeds conspiracy theories and undermines confidence in elections.\n\nDemocrats and their allies in the media haven\u2019t always seen every effort to update voter rolls as \u201csuppression.\u201d The same 1993 law \u2013 signed by President Bill Clinton and passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress \u2013\u00a0that forbids voter roll updates within 90 days of an election also requires regular list maintenance.\n\nGeorgia's lieutenant governor:Georgia's election reform law isn't voter suppression, but Republicans need to ease up\n\nThe media had no problem with this. Back in December 1994, The New York Times called the National Voter Registration Act a \u201ccommon-sense measure designed to make it easier for all Americans to participate in the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe story is the same in Georgia. In 1997, a Democratic legislature and governor enacted our state law that mandates regular cleanup of voter lists.\u00a0In GeoI successfully defended that state law in 2019 from efforts by Stacey Abrams to end it.\u00a0Judge Steve Jones, an Obama appointee, ruled that \u201cthere is no evidence at this time that\u201d voters removed were \"precluded or burdened by registering to vote again.\u201d\n\nDonna Brazile:Republicans crush voting rights, making a mockery of their support for Juneteenth: Brazile\n\nThe suppression narrative crumbles immediately in the face of facts.\n\nThough Republicans in Congress have not made any effort to roll back unnecessarily burdensome election regulations, now is the time to start. Our county elections officials need to be able to effectively plan elections. They need the tools to cut down lines and ensure voters have the equipment they need to cast their ballots. And yes, they need accurate rolls to uphold confidence in America\u2019s elections.\n\nNow is the time for Republicans to lead on election regulation reform.\n\nBrad Raffensperger is the secretary of state of Georgia.

There's 50 senators, right now, who refuse to vote on H.R. 8, which is a background check rule that the House passed [last year]. ... There's a reason they won't vote on it: to hold on to power.  \u201cI ask you, Mitch McConnell, and ask all of you senators who refuse to do anything about the violence, the school shootings, the supermarket shootings, I ask you, \u2018Are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children, our elderly and our churchgoers?' Because that's what it looks like.\u201d  Kerr, 56, is a longtime advocate for gun control. The issue is personal: His father, Malcolm, was shot to death in Beirut in 1984.  Shooter killed at least 18 students, officials say  State officials said at least 18 Robb Elementary School students and a teacher were killed by an 18-year-old gunman. The shooting took place roughly 350 miles southwest of Dallas, where the Warriors will face the Mavericks on Tuesday night, and followed other recent mass shootings in Buffalo and Laguna Woods, Calif  The House of Representatives passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 , which seeks to expand federal background checks for gun purchases. The legislation was conceived following a 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn. H.R. 8 would establish similar background checks.  \u201cIn the last 10 days, we've had elderly Black people killed in a supermarket in Buffalo. We've had Asian churchgoers killed in Southern California. Now we have children murdered at school,\u201d Kerr said, slamming the table at one point for emphasis. \u201cDo you realize 90 percent of Americans, regardless of political party, want universal background checks? We're being held hostage by 50 senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote, despite what we, the American people, want. They won't vote on it, because they want to hold on to their own power. It's pathetic.\u201d  Warriors star Stephen Curry shared a clip of Kerr's comments Tuesday and added, \u201cWatch this as much as you watch the game tonight.\u201d  Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd read a brief statement about the shooting during his pregame news conference.  \u201cOur hearts go out to the victims and family of the horrific events in Uvalde,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cWe send our condolences to our fellow Texans, and we'll keep them in our hearts. We truly will play with heavy hearts tonight for the community, for the school of Robb Elementary School.\u201d  The Warriors hold a 3-0 series lead over the Mavericks and can advance to their sixth NBA Finals in eight years with a Game 4 win.  The NBA issued a statement saying it was \u201cdevastated by the horrific shooting\u201d but did not move to postpone the game. Kidd and Kerr expressed a level of discomfort with playing mere hours after the mass shooting.  \u201cI want every person here, every person listening to this, to think about your own child or grandchild, mother or father, sister or brother,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHow would you feel if this happened to you today?

Joe Manchin Breaks With Party On Gun Control, \u2018Doesn\u2019t Support\u2019 House Measures)\n      \u201cThere is a lot of talk about banning assault-style weapons, semi-assault-style weapons \u2026 Where do you stand on banning them nationwide?\u201d Tur asked Whitmer.\n Whitmer explained she thinks Congress should take action because the country has seen too many tragedies such as the Boulder shooting but didn\u2019t go into greater detail. She added it\u2019s important to recognize changes need to be made to ensure \u201cweapons of mass death\u201d don\u2019t fall into the hands of people with violent motives.\n Tur jumped in and asked what changes Whitmer would support.\n \u201cWell, I think that there are a lot of changes that we could make. I mean, we\u2019ve seen Congress debate some things in terms of background checks, in terms of the things that can be used to modify guns to make them weapons of mass destruction,\u201d Whitmer answered. \u201cI think there are a lot of things that common sense would dictate make good sense in terms of how we keep these guns out of hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re not for a nationwide ban on semi-assault style weapons,\u201d Tur said.\n \n Whitmer avoided directly answering the question and instead said as governor of Michigan she \u201ccan\u2019t propose that.\u201d She went on to say there needs to be a \u201cconversation and robust debate\u201d with \u201cresponsible gun owners\u201d as part of the conversation.\n \u201cI know here in Michigan we\u2019ve got a lot of people who love to hunt. They\u2019re responsible gun owners who recognize background checks are important. Some of these mass destruction weapons don\u2019t have a place in the common sale in this country. So I do think that there is space for common ground here,\u201d she concluded.\n President Joe Biden has called on Congress to pass H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 and ban \u201cassault weapons\u201d with high-capacity magazines. The bills would mandate universal background checks on all gun purchases and would extend the length of time that a background check can be completed.",

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n      ((AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite))\n\n\nRepublicans, however, argued that because Washington, D.C.\u2019s establishment is constitutionally based, any change to the district must come in the form of a constitutional amendment \u2014\u00a0not legislation from Congress. And the GOP panned statehood as\u00a0a power grab by Democrats to expand the majority in the Senate by adding two more senators from a liberal enclave.\n\"Let's be clear what H.R. 51 is all about: It's about Democrats adding two new progressive U.S. senators to push a radical agenda championed by the Squad to reshape America into the socialist utopia they always talk about,\" said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky.\nBIDEN WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALLY SUPPORTS MAKING DC THE 51ST STATE\nDebate over statehood got heated on the House floor Thursday when New York Democrat Rep. Mondaire Jones accused certain Republicans of being against D.C. statehood because the district was not white enough in their minds to qualify for self-rule.\u00a0\n\n      Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., speaks before the Supreme Court on April 15, 2021, on his legislation to expand the Supreme Court.\n      \n\n\n\"I have had enough of my colleagues'\u00a0racist insinuations that somehow that people of Washington D.C. are incapable or even unworthy of our democracy,\" Jones said in a floor speech that drew a quick rebuke from Republicans. \"One Senate Republican\u00a0said that D.C.\u00a0wouldn't be a 'well rounded, working-class state.' I had no idea there were\u00a0so many syllables in the word white.\"\nD.C. is 46% Black and 46% White, according to\u00a02019 Census estimates.\nJones continued: \"One of my House Republican colleagues said that D.C. shouldn't be a state because the district doesn't have a landfill. My goodness, with all the racist trash my colleagues have brought to this debate, I can see why they're worried about having a place to put it.\"\nRepublicans immediately asked for Jones' words to be struck down, and the freshman Democrat agreed to withdraw his statements.\u00a0\nD.C. statehood already passed the House\u00a0last June\u00a0but it died in the GOP-led Senate. The chances of becoming law are better now with supportive Democrats in charge of both the Senate and White House, but the Senate remains the biggest challenge with the legislative filibuster still in place that requires 60 votes to advance legislation.\u00a0\nBut many Democrats in the House, including Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,\u00a0are demanding the Senate get rid of the filibuster so the statehood legislation could pass with a simple majority vote.\nHowever, not all 50 Democrats in the Senate have embraced D.C. statehood.\n\n      Activists hold signs as they take part in a rally in support of DC statehood near the US Capitol in Washington, DC on March 22, 2021. - Democrats emboldened by their control of the US House, Senate and White House launched a fresh push Monday for statehood for the nation's capital Washington, beginning with a high-profile congressional hearing addressing the issue.

The license plates of D.C. residents are a protest to their unequal status, reading: \"End Taxation Without Representation.\"\u00a0\nSupporters\u00a0organized simultaneous rallies throughout the district Thursday in advance of the vote in all eight wards, but those demonstrations were sparsely attended with about 10 people apiece showing up in two of the locations visited by Fox News cameras.\u00a0\nDEMOCRATS RENEW DC STATEHOOD PUSH THAT WOULD REMAKE NATIONAL POLITICS\nHolmes Norton said D.C. should be no different than the 37 others states that Congress admitted to the union without a constitutional amendment.\u00a0\n\"Congress has both the moral obligation and the constitutional authority to pass H.R. 51,\" D.C.'s lone non-voting delegate said in advance of the vote. \"This country was founded on the principles of no taxation without representation and consent of the governed. But D.C. residents are taxed without representation, and cannot consent to the laws under which they, as American citizens, must live.\"\n22 STATE REPUBLICAN AGS SEND LETTER ARGUING DC STATEHOOD IS \u2018UNCONSTITUTIONAL'\nBut\u00a0Rep.

    "body": "Investor and regulator focus on board composition and practices has evolved significantly over the past 20 years. In the wake of the Enron and WorldCom collapses, these stakeholders initially focused on strengthening board independence and oversight. After the financial crisis of 2008, that gave way to a greater focus on whether boards have the right mix of skills and experience to guide business strategy\u2014as well as mechanisms for shareholders to hold boards accountable for business performance. More recently, the focus on board diversity has not only accelerated, but also expanded to the broader question of how boards are overseeing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, in early 2022, investors raised the bar for board diversity, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed rules seeking greater disclosure of the board\u2019s role in climate change and cybersecurity, with rules on human capital management to come.\n\nThese trends have significant implications for board composition, size, and education. Companies need boards with directors who have a diversity of backgrounds, as well as the skills and experience to oversee the expanding list of priorities. They also need boards of sufficient size to accommodate these individuals, as well as to populate the (new) board committees that address ESG topics. And they need to have more robust onboarding programs for these new directors, as well as ongoing board education programs to ensure the entire board is not relying on the expertise of a few directors but is fluent in the growing list of issues that boards are expected to oversee.\n\nThis post provides insights relating to board composition (including gender, race, and sexual orientation diversity, director qualifications and skills), size, and education at S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies. Our findings are based on data derived from our live, interactive online dashboard powered by ESGAUGE, as well as a Chatham House Rule discussion with leading governance professionals held in April 2022.\n\n1See H.R.3763 \u2013 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (July 2002) and SEC\u2019s adoption of NASD and NYSE\u2019s Rulemaking Relating to Corporate Governance (November 2003).(go back)\n\n2See H.R.4173 \u2013 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (July 2010) and the SEC\u2019s Final Rule on Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations (\u201cProxy Access Rule\u201d) (August 2010).(go back)\n\n3Merel Spierings and Paul Washington, 2022 Proxy Season Preview and Shareholder Voting Trends, Brief 2: Human Capital Management Proposals, The Conference Board, February 2022.(go back)\n\n4The Conference Board, in collaboration with ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE, is keeping track of disclosures made by US public companies with respect to their board composition, director demographics, and governance practices. Our live, interactive online dashboard allows you to access and visualize practices and trends from 2016 to date by market index, business sector, and company size. The dashboard is organized in six parts: (1) Board Organization, (2) Board Leadership, (3) Board Composition, (4) New Directors, (5) Director Election & Removal, and (6) Other Board Policies.(go back)\n\n5On August 6, 2021, the SEC approved Nasdaq\u2019s Board Diversity Rule, which requires board diversity disclosures for Nasdaq-listed companies. Additionally, investors continue to make their proxy voting guidelines relating to board diversity more stringent. The pressures for increased diversity are continuing, even though California\u2019s board gender diversity quota law has been initially ruled unconstitutional.(go back)\n\n6Throughout this post, the data for 2022 is as of April 19, 2022.(go back)\n\n7To put these numbers in perspective, according to the US Census Bureau, 76.3 percent of the US population is White (population estimates from July 2021). The older the population, the higher this percentage: 69 percent of 40-year-olds, 74 percent of 50-year-olds, 78 percent of 60-year-olds, and 83 percent of 70- and 80-year-olds were White in 2017, according to data derived from the American Community Survey (source: Overflow Solutions). By comparison, in 2021, the average director age was 63 years in the S&P 500 and 62 years in the Russell 3000.(go back)\n\n8This increase may be due to Nasdaq\u2019s Board Diversity Rule, which requires companies to explain why they do not have at least one director who identifies as female and one who identifies as LGBTQ+ or another underrepresented group. Similarly, BlackRock now encourages companies to have at least one director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group, which includes individuals who identify as LGBTQ+.(go back)\n\n9Nasdaq\u2019s Board Diversity Rule may have had an impact here as well, as Nasdaq tends to have companies with smaller average market capitalization than the NYSE. Having said that, Nasdaq permits the smallest companies some flexibility in satisfying the threshold with two female directors(go back)\n\n10Lindsay Beltzer and Paul Washington, Crisis Management in the Era of \u201cNo Normal,\u201d The Conference Board, September 2021.(go back)\n\n11If a board has four committees with five members each, it will have 20 slots to fill. That requires at least 10 independent directors if each serves on two committees. Given that committee chairs often serve on only one committee, that suggests a board with 12 independent directors.(go back)",

    "body": "Democrats\u2019 push for the S. 1 / H.R. 1 Corrupt Politicians Act claims to be advancing voting rights, but ignores the foundational truth that every voter has the right to his legal vote not be canceled by someone else\u2019s fraud, which is why the bill\u2019s eradication of voter ID \u2013 an election integrity measure with strong bipartisan support \u2013 show this as a cynical power grab that principled senators must reject.\n\nS.1 is the Senate version of H.R. 1, officially named the For the People Act. It is currently the top priority for all national Democrats, from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi in Congress, to even Barack and Michelle Obama. It is called the Corrupt Politicians Act by those who study it because it throws out the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of fully counted votes, and does so in a way to hijack America\u2019s election system to guarantee that Democrats will keep the White House every four years, and permanently hold a solid majority in Congress.\n\nAlthough Democrats say it expands voting rights, it instead takes away those rights. Your right to vote has two parts: The first is being able to cast a ballot that is counted. The second is that your vote is not cancelled or watered down by someone else\u2019s illegal ballot or other election fraud.\n\nThe Corrupt Politicians Act destroys the latter in the name of the former.\n\nAmericans understand at a gut level that our voting rights must include both parts. Until recent years, if you wanted to exercise your right to vote, you went to your county building to register. Then on Election Day, you went to your assigned polling location in your neighborhood, where there was a good chance the poll workers knew you personally by name. But you signed in officially anyway, then you filled out your ballot and cast it in a secure setting with zero opportunity for interference or mischief.\n\nOne of the reasons Americans are willing to go through these election integrity steps is their sense of duty. Voting is a right that is also a duty. It\u2019s a great blessing to be able to decide the direction of your community, state, and even nation by choosing who the decision-makers will be.\n\nIt is a noble and righteous act, one best approached solemnly and after careful consideration, and going through several steps to get it right is well worth the trouble to have complete confidence in the outcome of the process.\n\nBut the other reason citizens undertake election integrity willingly is that they know these steps are actually part of their voting rights. It\u2019s not just your duty to vote, it is your right to have a system in place that provides safeguards. Election integrity is what gives us honest elections that, win or lose, we can all take to the bank.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that these measures are so popular. Voters support safeguarding our democracy.\n\nTake the example of voter identification. Most states have these ID laws, which merely require that a person show a license, passport, or other government ID to confirm they are who they say they are before participating \u2013 and potentially interfering \u2013 in an election. Even though it doesn\u2019t cost much to get a driver\u2019s license, voter ID laws typically include a provision that if for any reason a person cannot afford one, the government will give them an ID card for free.\n\nThe Corrupt Politicians Act says that voter ID treats blacks and other minorities unfairly, and abolishes this commonsense protection nationwide. Having lived for more than 70 years as a black man in America, I\u2019ve never found it an unfair burden to show my driver\u2019s license at the bank, when boarding an airplane, or doing all sorts of other things.\n\nIt\u2019s insulting to suggest that somehow I find it an unfair burden when I\u2019m protecting the right that my forebears fought so hard for so many years to secure.\n\nBut I\u2019m not alone in supporting voter ID, as Americans across the political spectrum do so. Fully 77 percent of voters support requiring ID to vote. Democrats say that are abolishing voter ID to help black voters, but those black voters support voter ID laws by a margin of 64 percent to 22 percent! Support is even more lopsided among Hispanics, 78 to 16 percent.\n\nDemocrats right now are seeking to have the U.S. House unseat a Republican from Iowa who is the duly certified winner of a congressional race and who has already been sworn in and served for almost three months in Congress. The vote margin between the candidates is a razor-thin six votes.\n\nImagine trying to be that precise in a race where 400,000 citizens cast a ballot, where adding just a half-dozen ballots to one candidate switches the outcome. Consider how reliable that voting process is when polling officials make you show \u2013 quickly and easily \u2013 that you are the voter you claim to be before you cast that ballot.\n\nImagine how chaotic it would be \u2013 and subject to fraud or abuse \u2013 if everyone knows before the big day that no matter who claims to be a voter in that election, it\u2019s illegal for officials to attempt to confirm that person\u2019s identity before casting what could be the deciding ballot.\n\nThat\u2019s why everyone benefits from voter ID laws. That\u2019s why everyone except Democrats in Washington support voter ID laws, even among population segments Democrats claim to be helping by abolishing it. And it is a perfect example of why S.1 (H.R. 1) is properly referred to as the Corrupt Politicians Act, and why Americans need to learn the facts and protect an election system in which it is easy to vote, but hard to cheat.\n\nKen Blackwell is the Distinguished Fellow for Human Rights and Constitutional Governance at the Family Research Council.

    "body": "President Barack Obama? Joe Biden? Actually, that was President Lyndon B. Johnson in a joint speech to Congress eight days after Bloody Sunday, when the John R. Lewis nearly lost his life. The vicious assault on peaceful demonstrators on March 7, 1965, setting out on their march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., was an inflection point, but not the sole factor in passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It took a bipartisan alliance (Northern Republicans and Democrats), religious and business leaders, and the full force of the presidency to raise this issue above the day-to-day politics of the time and get landmark legislation passed.\n\nSadly, the contents of the 1965 bill \u2014 including \u201ca simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution\u201d and elimination of \u201ctedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote,\u201d as Johnson described it \u2014 are still front and center as states devise mechanisms to throw voters off the rolls (with purges, for example), make access to the ballot more difficult (e.g., fewer poll locations, longer lines, voter ID requirements, elimination of no-excuse voting) and disallow votes (e.g. with signature match requirements). The motive of Jim Crow states in 1965 was the same as it is now in 2021: the suppression of minority voters to perpetuate minority white rule.\n\nThe sprawling H.R. 1, however, addresses issues well beyond voting access, encompassing everything from campaign finance reform to Supreme Court ethics. However meritorious all those provisions may be, the legislation\u2019s only hope (and it is a slim one) rests with Democrats\u2019 willingness to pare down the measure to match the nature of the current assault on voting rights: Restore the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, require no-excuse voting by mail and some period of early voting (including weekends), mandate a paper ballot trail, ban periodic purges without voters\u2019 consent, modernize voting systems and promote automatic registration. A short, easily understood list of items such as that will be critical to driving popular support. It is easy to think up reasons to oppose campaign finance reform; it is hard to deny the Justice Department the ability to anticipate and ward off anti-voting measures by states we now see are dedicated to reducing minority voting.\n\nIn short, if Democrats remove issues that will be used as a pretext for opposition, they can make this a clear up-or-down issue on voter suppression. Are you for or against Jim Crow laws?\n\nThen, just as in 1965, there will need to be a national, popular campaign. That will require presidential speeches and muscle, massive and peaceful demonstrations akin to the Black Lives Matter marches in 2020, clergy involvement, and travel and convention boycotts of states that seek to roll back voting rights. If Republicans want to filibuster, they will need to engage in the same 24/7 harangues that Southern segregationists utilized in the 1960s \u2014 and suffer by the comparison. Everything should be done to find a bipartisan filibuster-proof majority to champion such a bill \u2014 or if that fails, to make crystal clear to all Democrats that a democracy exception to the filibuster rule is essential.\n\nAfter passage of H.R. 1, Biden released a statement, his strongest to date as president on voting. \u201cIn the wake of an unprecedented assault on our democracy; a coordinated attempt to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the American people never before seen in our history; and a new wave of aggressive attacks on voting rights taking place in states across the country,\" he said, \u201cI applaud Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and the House of Representatives for passing H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021.\u201d He added, \u201cThis landmark legislation is urgently needed to protect that right, to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy.\u201d\n\nHowever, Biden also vowed to help \u201crefine and advance\u201d (emphasis added) the bill. One hopes that he and his advisers can level with his own side: Only a focused bill aimed at exposing and eliminating Jim Crow voting practices stands a hope of passage. At stake is the future of our democracy.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and the socialist squad in the U.S. House, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris pumped oxygen into the dangerous Defund Police movement and refused to stand with our heroic police men and women when they needed it most.\u00a0\nPELOSI PRAISES SPENDING BILL ADVANCING AS \u2018GREAT DAY OF PRIDE\u2019 FOR US AMID AFGHANISTAN CRISIS\nBecause of their irresponsible actions, our police are less respected and a crime crisis is sweeping our nation by criminals who\u2019ve been emboldened by the radical Democrats\u2019 \"soft on crime, hard on police\" positioning.\u00a0\u00a0\nJoe Biden and the unhinged Democrats in Congress are also busy pushing irresponsible multi-trillion spending bills at a time when our economy is already overheating and straddled with unsustainable debt.\u00a0\nIn their drive to enact the socialist wish list while they\u2019re still in power, these leftists have caused a raging and unchecked inflation crisis.\u00a0Gas, groceries, goods -- you name it -- just about everything is more expensive than it was seven short months ago because of the policies implemented by the Democrats.\u00a0\nARIZ AG MARK BRNOVICH: HR4 ANOTHER DEM ELECTION POWER GRAB\nIndeed, comparisons to the failed administration of Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s are plentiful.\u00a0Even President Biden himself used the phrase \"crisis of confidence\" in remarks recently that were first made infamous by President Carter in his depressing \"malaise speech\" in July 1979.\u00a0 And unsurprisingly, polls for Biden are heading in the wrong direction.\u00a0\nRecent headlines such as \"Regrets: Trump would beat Biden today, more women and blacks support,\" suggest a change in direction is needed, but these arrogant Democrats can\u2019t stop digging deeper.\u00a0\nNow, Speaker Pelosi is setting her radical sights on our sacred election system.\u00a0 With America facing renewed mask mandates, inflation, and a national security nightmare, the Democrats want to add a voting crisis to their trophy collection of infamy.\u00a0\nCAL THOMAS: AFGHANISTAN'S HORRORS WILL SPREAD. DOES TEAM BIDEN HAVE A GRIP ON REALITY?\nPelosi called the House back into session this week to pass their latest irrational attempt to make our elections less secure along with their irresponsible multi-trillion dollar socialist budget resolution.\u00a0\nAfter the disastrous H.R. 1 -- \"For The People Act\" -- was defeated in the U.S. Senate, the radical left continued plotting and devised a new pathway forward to create a system that would empower Washington politicians and bureaucrats to take over our elections.\u00a0\nH.R. 4 -- the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 -- named after the late civil rights icon and U.S. Congressman from Georgia, would take America back to 1965 by ignoring all the progress that Congressman Lewis fought for and countless others died for.\u00a0\nH.R. 4 would re-institute segregation era \"pre-clearance\" rules that were included in the landmark Voting Rights Act and since struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013.\u00a0 It seems that the unhinged Democrats in Congress are the only Americans left who believe that we\u2019ve made no progress as a country since 1965.\u00a0\nThe truth is that voting has never been simpler or more accessible to more Americans and voter turnout has never been more robust.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nIf radical leftists in the House had their way, state-run elections would be under the thumb of faceless D.C. bureaucrats with hidden left-wing political agendas -- a scary thought indeed.\u00a0\nThe various ongoing Biden-created crises - border, Afghanistan, crime, inflation - are all self-inflicted wounds that should cost the Democrats the rest of their radical agenda in the Senate, including the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation boondoggle and election power grab.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nJoe Biden and the Democrats returning to Congress for this late summer session must come to grips with the fact that their seven months in power have been a total failure.\u00a0\nGoing forward, they should fix the problems they\u2019ve created before adding any more.\u00a0 Otherwise, the American people will surely fix it during the midterm election in fifteen months.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID BOSSIE",

It\u2019s a naked bid to federalize nearly all election rules, in blatant violation of the Constitution. \n\n\n\n\nIt would strike down most voter-ID requirements and block states from purging ineligible voters, force automatic voter-registration, impose new campaign-finance rules and even deny states their rights to run their own redistricting.\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats pretend that anything less is the death of democracy, but the bill is really just an effort to force progressives\u2019 preferences for voting rules on the entire nation to address an entirely imaginary threat \u2014 just like their talk of \u201cJim Crow\u201d about a Georgia voting-reform law that produced rules far more liberal than those of (for example) President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware. \n\n\n\n\nCrucially, Manchin asks, \u201cAre the very Republican senators who voted to impeach [Donald] Trump because of actions that led to an attack on our democracy unwilling to support actions to strengthen our democracy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nManchin understands that such a nakedly partisan effort can only widen the nation\u2019s political divisions: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a country divided any further than I\u2019m in right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we continue to divide it \u2026 it\u2019s not going to be the country that we love and know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBesides, Americans don\u2019t want one party \u201cto dictate and demand everything and anything it wants,\u201d he added. Which is why he also reaffirmed his commitment to keep the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, ensuring at least some bipartisan support.\n\n\n\n\nPreserving the filibuster dooms not only S.1, but much of the rest of Biden\u2019s much-hyped agenda. Maybe Manchin\u2019s wake-up call will inspire the rest of his party to stop focusing on wild fantasies and get to work on measures that can command bipartisan support in a Congress that Democrats barely control. \n\n\n\n\nQuit concentrating on offering red meat for partisans and put effort into bills that serve the nation\u2019s actual needs.",

Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff introduced legislation this week allowing voters to have access to water while waiting in line to vote.The measure - called the Voter's Access to Water Act - is a direct response to a provision in their home state's controversial new voting law, Senate Bill 202, which among its many reforms strictly limited providing food and drink to people standing in line to vote.The law has come under intense scrutiny from activists and corporations since Gov. Brian Kemp (D) signed it in late March, and at least five lawsuits have been filed challenging it.The provision of SB 202 states no person can \"solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method, nor shall any person distribute or display any campaign material, nor shall any person give, offer to give, or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector... on any day in which ballots are being cast.\"Poll workers could still make available \"self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote.\"Warnock and Ossoff's bill would prohibit states from banning the provision of food and water to voters waiting in line as long as volunteers are not engaging in campaigning or political activity, and as long as food and water are offered to every voter.Ossoff said in a Tuesday statement that the bill \"will ensure a nonpartisan, Good Samaritan volunteer can offer voters in line a bottle of water without fear of criminal prosecution.\"The move comes as Democrats and Republicans spar over voting rights amid former President Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election is stolen.The Senate Rules Committee is marking up its version of Democrats' massive voting rights bill, S. 1, on Tuesday.

    "body": "But more than a century and a half after slavery was abolished, there still remains an intense debate over whether the federal government should compensate the descendants of former slaves to atone for the country\u2019s legacy of slavery, in the form of reparations, and what form reparations should take.In April, the House Judiciary Committee held a historic vote on H.R. 40, a bill that would create a federal commission to study \u201cthe lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery\u201d in the U.S. \u2014 looking at various forms of \u201ceconomic, political, educational, and social discrimination\u201d \u2014 and to develop proposals for \u201cappropriate remedies,\u201d including potential reparations for Black Americans. First introduced by late Michigan Rep. John Conyers in 1989, the bill was finally approved by the judiciary committee and now awaits a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives.While reparations is a complex and emotionally charged issue, here\u2019s an overview of what you should know.What are reparations?Reparations by the federal government would offer restitution to the descendants of slaves, or even all Black Americans, for the centuries of servitude, unpaid forced labor and suffering enslaved people endured.Supporters of the H.R. 40 bill also believe that reparations would compensate Black Americans who have felt the negative effects of slavery\u2019s legacy, including various forms of racial discrimination and systemic oppression.In January, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNBC that the federal government exploring the legacy of slavery on Black Americans and possible reparations is something that\u2019s necessary for many Black Americans \u201cto be made whole.\u201dThe general case for and against reparationsProponents of reparations point to the fact that, even well after slavery was abolished, Black Americans faced discrimination and unequal treatment at the hands of the government, and that legacy of racism still affects people of color in America.\u201cAs a result of the historic and continued discrimination, African Americans continue to suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships,\u201d states H.R. 40, which specifically points to the high incarceration rate of Black Americans as well as the striking racial wealth gap in the U.S. Median wealth for white families is $188,200, compared to $24,100 for Black families, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances.Arguments against reparations include the idea that slavery was abolished so long ago that \u201cno one currently alive was responsible,\u201d as Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell said in 2019 after a House hearing on the matter. McConnell called slavery America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin,\u201d but argued the country has since made racial progress and strides toward rectifying the past, including passing civil rights legislation and electing Barack Obama.However, as journalist and author Ta-Nehisi Coates, pointed out when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee in 2019, \u201cwell into this century, the United States was still paying out pensions to the heirs of Civil War soldiers...despite no one being alive who signed those treaties.\u201dWhat form could reparations take and how much could they cost?Just as there is debate over whether reparations are necessary, proponents and critics alike disagree over whether reparations are feasible and what form they might take.For instance, critics like McConnell and conservative pundit David Frum have argued that it would be too difficult to determine who to compensate and by how much.Some suggestions for how to handle reparations include direct cash payments to Black Americans who are descended from former slaves. Others include a combination of financial assistance and social programs aimed at benefiting the Black community, including affordable housing, education programs and free college tuition, as well as grants for housing and Black-owned businesses to help ensure long-term economic success for Black Americans.Meaningful reparations that would close the racial wealth gap would cost the U.S. government between $10 trillion and $12 trillion overall, or roughly $800,000 for each eligible Black household, according to William Darity, a Duke University professor of economics and public policy who studies and advocates for reparations. Another public policy profesor, the University of Connecticut\u2019s Thomas Craemer, has estimated a fair cost could be as high as $19 trillion, taking into account the amount of free and involuntary labor derived from millions of slaves (24 hours a day, 365 days a year) dating back to the United States\u2019 inception.To opponents, reparations would simply cost the federal government too much money. Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, has written that shouldering such a cost \u201cwould totally wreck the economy,\u201d especially at a time national debt has climbed to more than $28 trillion, thanks in part to pandemic stimulus spending.So called \u201cbaby bonds\u201d \u2014 which would provide every child a government funded savings account at birth \u2014 are seen as an alternative to reparations and come with a lower price tag. Darrick Hamilton, a professor of public policy at Ohio State University, has said that even seeding each account with $25,000 would cost the government $100 billion a year, equal to \u201cabout 2% of federal expenditures now.\u201d Baby bonds would especially benefit low-income households, and Black families suffer the highest poverty rate in the U.S. by race.Calls for reparations go back centuriesTalk of reparations goes back well before slavery was even abolished in the U.S. Quakers and other abolitionists often argued that freed slaves should be entitled to some form of compensation for the free labor they provided.In the final months of the Civil War, the Union\u2019s Special Field Orders, No. 15 called for 400,000 acres of land to be confiscated from Confederate landowners in Southern states and given to newly freed slaves and their families to ensure they could survive economically after generations of servitude.The land was to be divvied up in parcels no larger than 40 acres apiece, which became the inspiration for the expression \u201c 40 acres and a mule \u201d often cited today by those in favor of reparations ( H.R. 40 takes its name from the expression).The order is generally seen as the first-ever form of government reparations offered to free slaves. However, after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, President Andrew Johnson ordered all of the land returned to White Conderate landowners, provided they pledged loyalty to the United States.Later in the 19th Century, there was a movement to create pension funds for former slaves to compensate for their involuntary labor. But with many federal agencies vehemently opposed to the idea, legislation ultimately failed.One of the few historic cases of a former slave actually being awarded reparations for their forced servitude came in the 1870s, when Henrietta Wood (who had been freed but then kidnapped and sold back into slavery) won a lawsuit that included an award of $2,500, or about $70,000 in today\u2019s dollars.One of the most notable modern efforts to secure reparations came from Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a descendant of slaves. Her class-action lawsuit sought billions of dollars from corporations such as Aetna insurance and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco for financial ties to slavery. A federal judge ruled the plaintiffs did not prove a connection between the companies and the plaintiffs\u2019 enslaved ancestors.The outlook for reparations going forwardH.R. 40 has a strong chance of passing the Democrat-majority House, but faces a more \u201cbleak\u201d future in the U.S. Senate, where most Republican senators are likely to vote against it.\u201cWhile both parties have been reticent to embrace reparations legislation in the past, the majority of Republicans oppose it,\u201d Politico\u2019s Maya King wrote in April, noting that polls found 60% of Democrats support forming a committee to study reparations, with 74% of Republicans in opposition.However, some members of Congress have suggested that President Joe Biden could create his own commission to study reparations. The White House has said that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris support H.R. 40.Indeed, reparations are not only a federal issue. With the broader reckoning around racial injustice in the U.S., various local efforts to offer slavery reparations in some form have sprung up across the country.Those include the city council of Asheville, North Carolina\u2019s 2020 decision to apologize for slavery while offering reparations in the form of funding programs aimed at increasing homeownership and business opportunities for Black residents in the mostly white city.And, in the suburb of Evanston, Illinois officials voted to set aside the first $10 million in tax revenue from the now-legal sale of recreational marijuana to fund programs that narrow the city\u2019s racial wealth gap in order to address the area\u2019s history of housing discrimination that affected Black residents, including practices such as \u201c redlining.\u201dIn California, officials recently announced the formation of a state task force to study the issue of reparations and make proposals to compensate the state\u2019s Black residents within two years.Don\u2019t miss:Juneteenth: The 155-year-old holiday\u2019s history explained100 years after the Tulsa Massacre, a survivor\u2019s descendant carries on the tradition of entrepreneurship on Black Wall StreetSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter",

    "body": "Our asylum laws were never meant to encourage millions to make a dangerous journey to the U.S. They are not a blueprint for a human trafficking pipeline\n close\n  America is under siege by both cartels and our own politicians. Since day one of his presidency Joe Biden has made it clear that he would rather allow cartels to control our border than be vulnerable to political attacks from the left.\n  As a result, we have experienced the largest border security crisis in modern American history. The Secretary of Homeland Security has perpetuated this crisis through \"encounter and release\" policies that ignore our laws and put both Americans and the migrants seeking to come here in danger.\n  Now, House Republicans have a chance to force the President's hand to end the crisis and reclaim control of our border from cartels. H.R. 29, the Border Safety and Security Act, will immediately reverse these \"encounter and release\" policies by requiring DHS to instead \"detain or turn away.\"\n  This is the border security equivalent of the pandemic-prevention deterrent known as Title 42, which all Republicans have supported \u2013 somewhat imprudently \u2013 as the solution for the border. It was only a Band-Aid solution during the pandemic and a health policy is not a border policy, but it powers make clear the border solution.\n  The problem is that the Biden administration has used asylum as the exception to swallow the rule of border security; now hundreds of thousands arrive at our southern border each month.\n  Secretary Mayorkas has released between 1-2 million illegal migrants into American communities, heavily through an abuse of parole authority which is supposed to be used on a \"case-by-case\" basis.\n  We know that in just the first 15 months of the Biden administration, DHS released 836,225 people encountered of the more than 1 million illegal migrants apprehended by CBP not turned away under Title 42 \u2013 some 80 percent.\n  Immediate release of migrants before adjudication of claims is not only a problem in each case, but also represents a \"pull-factor\" for more illegal migrants. An incomprehensible 4 million migrants have been encountered under the Biden regime, overwhelming border patrol.\n  Agents have been taken away from patrolling to \"processing\" and this creates security gaps for cartels to traffic in drugs like fentanyl, which killed at least 72,000 Americans in 2021. More, it has allowed cartels to move some 1 million \"got aways\" who evade arrest and are often the more dangerous individuals \u2013 sometimes affiliated with gangs or terrorist organizations.\n  We should not accept this. Our laws surrounding asylum were never meant to encourage migrants to make the dangerous journey through hundreds of miles of desert terrain \u2014 driven by cartels that are basically terrorists for hire. Our asylum laws were meant to be a last resort for those fleeing legitimate persecution and had no other options \u2014 not the blueprint for a human trafficking pipeline.\n  The Border Safety and Security Act is the solution.\n  First, the bill provides the Secretary of DHS with the authority to turn away illegal migrants without admissible documentation if the Secretary sees it necessary to obtain operational control of the border. Operational control is not a controversial idea and is already required by the \" Secure Fence Act of 2006 , which then-Senator Joe Biden and current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for\n  Turning away illegal migrants is not a new concept \u2014 the public health authority commonly referred to as \"Title 42\" has allowed DHS to do so since March of 2020 . In fact, the Biden administration actually appealed court decisions that would have terminated the policy. Biden's DHS admits the potential need to turn migrants away because \"we anticipate migration levels will increase as smugglers seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants once the Title 42 public health order is lifted.\"\n  Further, H.R. 29 will require DHS to use this \"turn-away\" authority if someone cannot be detained through the pendency of an asylum claim or placed in a program consistent with Migrant Protection Protocols. Current law already requires illegal migrants seeking asylum to be detained through the adjudication of their claim; this closes Biden's loopholes.\n  There will be some who spuriously claim this bill would somehow eliminate asylum, and that is flatly false. Those who claim it are either misinformed or seek to misinform. H.R. 29 corrects the abuse of our asylum laws and allows for migrants to claim asylum \u2013 which is good for America and good for immigrants. Further, it does not do anything DHS is not already either allowed or even required to do under current law.\n  From before time of the Declaration of Independence or our Constitution , America has been a refuge for those seeking freedom from oppression. She should remain so. But we cannot allow laws meant to serve the oppressed to create even more oppression in the false name of compassion.\n  We will never solve this border crisis if Congress is not willing to step in and fix the policies causing it. The Border Safety and Security Act is the single best policy we would put forward to do that today.\n  Mayra Flores is a former Texas Congresswoman and is now a Senior Fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\n  Republican Chip Roy represents Texas' 21st Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives.

How many fraudulent ballots got deposited in these boxes, unchecked, and then got counted?

Pelosi claims infrastructure and reconciliation are now delinked, but the evidence tells another story,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIn addition, this infrastructure framework is still a bad deal for conservatives. The legislation recklessly spends $1 trillion on liberal policy priorities, despite the fact that the national debt and inflation are both out of control, all of which Democrats claim is \u2018paid for\u2019 by using slick accounting tricks. We are urging all conservatives to vote no.\u201d\n\nHeritage Action said in their release that voting for the bill would only enable President Joe Biden\u2019s even more radical $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. The activist organization said in their release:\n\nThis week, the House will be voting on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684), the so-called \u201cbipartisan\u201d infrastructure package. The legislation recklessly spends $1 trillion, despite the fact that the national debt is approaching $30 trillion and\u00a0inflation is surging\u00a0to levels not seen in 13 years, all of which is \u201cpaid\u201d for by using slick accounting tricks. Not only is the deal bad policy, but it is also a bad process, as it is a prerequisite to passing the\u00a0rest of\u00a0President Biden\u2019s catastrophic agenda through a Democrat-only reconciliation package.] This infrastructure package should be opposed on process\u00a0and\u00a0policy. Supporters of the bill often reference crumbling roads and bridges when naming reasons for their support, but the deal earmarks almost as much money for the subsidization of railroads and public transit ($105 billion) as it does for rebuilding roads and bridges ($110 billion). Of that sum, nearly\u00a0$40 billion\u00a0would go to public transit authorities, despite the fact that Congress sent more than $67 billion to transit under the guise of pandemic relief funds over the past year and a half, a staggering amount that is equal to more than three years of revenue from fares, parking fees, and advertising, most of which becomes\u00a0welfare for labor unions. The package also includes almost $8 billion in subsidies for electric vehicle chargers, even though profit incentives have driven private actors in the auto industry, independent startups, and utilities across the country to rush to build charging stations on their own. These are just a few examples of the bloated spending in the deal, which could not come at a worse time as the nation deals with the worst inflation in more than a decade.\n\nHeritage Action noted that the so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill contains misleading provisions that would not offset the bill\u2019s $1.2 trillion price tag. The conservative organization said that selling of 5G wireless spectrum and selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be used to pay off the debt, not to finance new spending.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill would add $256 billion to the deficit over ten years. The Penn-Wharton Budget model noted that the bipartisan infrastructure bill would not result in \u201csignificant\u201d economic growth.\n\nRepublicans in and out of Congress have pushed House Republicans not to support the bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) announced last week that he would whip Republicans against the bill. President Donald Trump has called on Republicans to oppose the bill as well.\n\nThe bipartisan infrastructure would also\u00a0advance\u00a0leftist priorities by:\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

(RELATED: The House Just Passed H.R. 1 \u2013 Here\u2019s What\u2019s In It)\n WATCH:\n      Cohost Whoopi Goldberg brought up the topic, asking McCain why she believed Republicans were so opposed to the bill, dubbed the For the People Act.\n \u201cWhat this bill has in it that I find particularly problematic is it\u2019s going to allow felons to vote even if you are convicted of election fraud,\u201d McCain began, adding that she believed felons should lose \u201cthe liberty and luxury of voting\u201d if the crime they were convicted of was the abuse of that right.\n \n \u201cIt eliminates the voter ID,\u201d McCain continued, noting that voting was just one of many instances in which identification might be required: \u201cTo adopt a pet, to rent a car, to get on a plane, to buy cold medicine, to buy a cell phone and to get a job.\u201d\n McCain went on to note that the bill would lower the voting age to 16 \u2014 a point she said was problematic because Democrats had also insisted on raising the age of coverage under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s parental plans to 26.\n \u201cThe idea was that 26-year-olds still really haven\u2019t had this, like, you know, they\u2019re a failure to launch, and they still need help from their parents,\u201d McCain said. \u201cSo on one end, 26-year-olds can\u2019t pay for their own health care, but 16-year-olds should have the right to vote and have the responsibility and competence to vote.\u201d\n McCain concluded that her biggest problem was the use of taxpayer funding for political campaigns.\n \u201cI just don\u2019t think that our tax paying dollars while the country is absolutely falling apart should be having our taxpayer dollars having, you know, influencing our elections,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like people are just seeing it through one very linear lens. This isn\u2019t about whatever \u2014 however you feel about Republicans and Republicans trying to take rights away. It\u2019s about how you interpret the Constitution and how you interpret states\u2019 rights, and I think it\u2019s just intellectually dishonest and quite frankly just in bad faith to talk about how Republicans are evil and how they want to ruin the world. This is a basic disagreement on how you think states\u2019 rights should be run.\u201d",

    "body": "\u201cToday, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am signing an executive order to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and improve access to voting,\u201d Biden said Sunday in a videotaped address to the Martin and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast. \u201cEvery eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.\u201d\n\nThe order directs federal agencies to develop a strategic plan for promoting voter registration and participation, including potentially applying to be a state-designated voter registration agency and providing recommendations on leave for federal employees to vote or to serve as poll workers.\n\nSome states have programs to automatically register eligible Americans to vote, unless they opt out, when they interact with DMVs as well as state agencies that administer federal programs such as military recruitment, Medicaid and food stamps. Under the Trump administration, however, some federal agencies refused to share the data that would allow states to automatically register voters this way, citing concerns about the privacy of health data. Biden\u2019s executive order instructs federal agencies to relax that policy.\n\nThe order also aims to expand access to voting among active-duty members of the military as well as to all eligible federally incarcerated people.\n\nAnd it establishes a steering group on Native American voting rights tasked with producing recommendations by next year on expanding voter outreach and turnout among Native American communities.\n\nBiden\u2019s move comes days after the House passed expansive legislation to create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting. The measure, H.R. 1, largely mirrors a bill passed by the chamber two years ago. But it has faced fierce Republican attacks that threaten to stop it cold in the Senate.\n\nThe bill\u2019s voting provisions would guarantee no-excuse mail voting and at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections; require states to use their government records to automatically register citizens to vote; restore voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences; and mandate the use of paper ballots.\n\nDuring his remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Trump blasted H.R. 1, accusing Democrats of wanting to register all welfare recipients to vote.\n\nNo Republicans voted for the bill in 2019 or last week, when it was approved 220 to 210.\n\nCritics argue that the proposed laws, which would restrict absentee balloting, early voting and other aspects of election administration, represent a cynical ploy to make it harder primarily for Democratic voters to participate.\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.",

Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ) speaks during a rally at Newark City Hall on June 17, 2022 in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nNEW JERSEY \u2014 A congressman from New Jersey wants to pay firearm owners more than they\u2019re worth \u2013 up to 25 percent more \u2013 as part of a guns-for-debit cards buyback proposal.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. reintroduced a proposed federal law, H.R. 1361, which he has dubbed \u201cthe Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act of 2023.\u201d If it becomes law, the bill would provide federal grants to local communities to buy back guns from their owners. According to a statement from the congressman\u2019s office:\n\n\u201cRep. Payne, Jr.\u2019s bill provides the U.S. Department of Justice a two-year, $360 million grant to exchange smart debit cards for firearms. The exchanges would happen through local gun dealers and the debit cards would be worth the market value of their firearm plus an additional 25 percent of the gun\u2019s value. Market value would be based on the condition, age and model of the firearm. Most of the guns recovered through the exchanges would be recycled.\u201d Payne \u2013 a Democrat who represents the state\u2019s 10th district \u2013 said that gun buyback programs have been working in cities such as Newark and East Orange, which he represents.

Nationwide, almost 7,000 Americans and close to 300 children and teens have died from gun violence this year, Payne said. \u201cThere is no gun violence without guns,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cMy bill gives people a reason to sell their guns to create safer neighborhoods for neighborhood families and children.\u201d",

No wonder they had no interest this week in hearing from a Democratic legend who knows\u2014and can prove\u2014that they are full of it.\n\nThat Democrat is Bill Gardner, New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state. Mr. Gardner has been overseeing Granite State voting since Dec. 2, 1976, a week before Stacey Abrams\u2019s 3rd birthday. In December, a bipartisan vote of the New Hampshire Legislature elected him to a 23rd two-year term. The longest-serving secretary of state in U.S. history, he\u2019s an institution, famous for his apolitical commitment to the state\u2019s constitution and its first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nMr. Gardner was invited (by Republicans) to testify at Tuesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which the Democratic majority titled \u201cJim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote.\u201d Ms. Abrams got most of the headlines; the media and Senate Democrats barely acknowledged Mr. Gardner\u2019s presence. And no wonder. It isn\u2019t only that Mr. Gardner vehemently opposes his party\u2019s H.R.1 bill, which would federally impose procedures such as early and absentee voting on the states. He also has incontrovertible evidence that the narrative behind it is a crock.\n\n\u201cJust because you make voting easier, it does not raise turnout automatically,\u201d Mr. Gardner told the committee. It can have the opposite result by undermining \u201cthe trust and confidence voters have in the process.\u201d He called it a \u201cfine balance.\u201d The New Hampshire evidence makes the case.\n\nBy Democrats\u2019 definition, New Hampshire has some of the most \u201csuppressive\u201d voter laws anywhere. In the hearing and in a subsequent interview with me, Mr. Gardner explained that some of these rules are part of the state\u2019s constitution. That document requires that residents show up to vote in person unless they are physically disabled or out of town. That means no mail-in voting. The state constitution requires that the final vote tally for each candidate be publicly declared at each polling place the night of the election after the polls close. This is one reason New Hampshire doesn\u2019t allow early voting, which can cause the counting to stretch for days.",

Our\u00a0first responders, health care heroes, and most of our teachers have now been vaccinated. We lowered the age [of eligibility] a few days ago to 55 and now we\u2019re opening it up to everybody.\nWe\u2019re dealing with the situation we have in Georgia, every state is different in a lot of ways. We\u2019re seeing tremendous demands in the metro Atlanta area. Thankfully the federal government has increased the vaccine supply that we\u2019re getting. We were 49th out of 50 per capita for the number of vaccines we were getting, which was really holding us back. Even though we had great demand in the metro area, in parts of rural Georgia we started seeing the demand drop, we started seeing the number of appointments people could get go up, therefore we felt like we need to open it up further, give everybody eligibility. Let\u2019s keep getting shots in arms.\nKemp also discussed the state's Republican-sponsored election reform bill, which was passed by the legislature Thursday despite outcry from liberal activists.\nWhat this\u00a0bill actually does is\u00a0fight the rhetoric from those\u00a0that are fund-raising off of\u00a0this issue and polarizing it, to\u00a0take away from the\u00a0unconstitutional power grab of\u00a0H.R.\u00a01 that\u2019s going on in Washington D.C.\u00a0right now.\u00a0It further secures our absentee\u00a0ballots by mail by requiring a\u00a0photo I.D., which\u00a0the vast majority of Georgians\u00a0support.

Joyce Beatty, the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; Philonise Floyd, an activist and George Floyd's brother; high-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump; and other politicians and civil rights leaders. \"This nation has a moral obligation to make sure that every citizen has full voting rights,\" said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \"Anything short of that is a true threat to our democracy.\" Meanwhile, about a thousand more people loosely gathered near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for the Make Good Trouble Rally in Washington, D.C. on the 58th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington. Among the group's demands are action on voting rights legislation currently stalled in Congress, an end to the Senate filibuster rule and movement on a range of issues including police reform, infrastructure, healthcare and the environment. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, one of the main sponsors of the rally, called it a \"defining moment in the political history of this nation.\" Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter said the nationwide rallies follow in the footsteps of the direct action and civil disobedience strategies King used. \u201cPart of what gives us hope is that we've been here before, and we won,\u201d Albright said. Brown added many of the demands of the original March of Washington have yet to be addressed, including more protections for voting rights. \"It's not just about lifting up the legacy of what happened 58 years ago,\" Brown said. \"America has unfinished business.\" March On for Voting Rights called on Congress to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act (H.R. 4) and the For the People Act (H.R. 1). \"These bills are incredibly essential to ensure that we have access to the ballot,\" said Stasha Rhodes, campaign manager of 51 for 51, an advocacy group for Washington, D.C., statehood and one of the march's organizers. Follow my colleague Matt today too as he covers the Make Good Trouble rally on the other side of the mall! https://t.co/n7JnvGPS30 \u2014 Cady Stanton (@cady_stanton) August 28, 2021 The marches oppose almost 400 bills in 48 states that organizers say \"amount to shameful, outright voter suppression,\" according to the event website. At least six bills in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma shorten windows to apply for mail-in ballots, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy nonprofit that tracks voter suppression legislation . Bills in Iowa and Montana call for reducing polling place availability. Georgia and Iowa bills seek to limit voting days and hours. Other bills, many of which have already been signed into law, ban ballot drop boxes and mail-in voting, impose harsher voter ID requirements and prohibit giving water to voters in line.Advocates say these efforts target Black voters and other voters of color, who have faced voter suppression throughout U.S. history. \"There's relics of the Jim Crow past that we see in these laws and its efforts to prevent the voter turnout of Black and brown communities,\" Rhodes said. Johnson urged protesters to spend time reflecting on the work of civil rights leaders of the past and to know that the fight for voting rights is not a new battle. He added that marching is not the final step in creating change and that attendees should also contact their local representatives and organize within their own communities. \"Freedom is a constant struggle,\" he said. \"We have to protect it. We need to speak loudly, in unison, just like those before us did.\" Contact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.",

    "body": "Earlier this year, Democrats tried \u2014\u00a0and failed \u2014 to advance H.R. 1, a federal takeover of state elections. But they\u2019re back at it again, this time with the so-called Freedom to Vote Act. Considering the contents of their radical proposal, a more accurate name would be the \u201cFreedom to Cheat Act.\u201d\nDespite\u00a0Democrat\u00a0attempts to spin their\u00a0latest\u00a0voting bill as a\u00a0\u201ccompromise,\u201d in truth, it\u2019s as radical as ever. It\u2019s designed to\u00a0thwart election integrity, manipulate state redistricting decisions and slant elections to help Democrats win.\n The Freedom to Cheat Act would\u00a0eviscerate\u00a0commonsense state voter ID laws\u00a0passed in\u00a036 states, instead requiring only that a third person attests that a voter is who they claim to be. It would\u00a0force 37 states\u00a0to adopt\u00a0automatic voter registration\u00a0on short notice. In the past, such efforts have\u00a0led to illegal immigrants\u00a0being registered as well as\u00a0massive registration errors. Additionally, 29 states\u00a0would be forced\u00a0to\u00a0adopt same-day voter registration, making it\u00a0easier to commit voter fraud\u00a0by\u00a0giving election workers no time to verify a person\u2019s eligibility. On top of that, it would\u00a0force states to let violent felons vote in federal elections as soon as they are out of prison \u2014 even if they have not completed all the terms of their sentence.\n Far from an altruistic effort to \u201cstrengthen our democracy,\u201d Democrats have a political stake in getting the bill passed: it would give them decisive power over the redistricting process. Democrats want to usurp states\u2019 prerogative to draw their own congressional districts, instead implementing federal mandates for how districts are drawn, subject to enforcement by the attorney general. This would eliminate voters\u2019 ability to make their own choice about how congressional districts are drawn and remove their capability to hold officials accountable for partisan gerrymandering.\n It gets worse. Democrat politicians have a personal incentive to champion the Freedom to Cheat Act. The bill includes nearly the exact same campaign funding scheme as\u00a0H.R. 1, in which taxpayers would provide\u00a0a\u00a0600%\u00a0match\u00a0for political donations under $200. For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in\u00a0taxpayer\u00a0funds for a total contribution of $1,400. Small dollar political\u00a0donations\u00a0topped $2.7 billion in the 2020 cycle, putting\u00a0taxpayers potentially on the hook\u00a0for billions more if that same pattern kept up in future elections.\n  Democrats claim the Freedom to Cheat Act is necessary to protect the right to vote, but that\u2019s a lie. Discriminatory election laws are\u00a0still illegal\u00a0under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which bans voting discrimination \u201cbased on race, color, or membership in a language minority group.\u201d In truth, it\u2019s never been easier for Americans to register and vote. Census Bureau data shows that\u00a0the 2020 presidential election had \u201cthe highest voter turnout of the 21st century.\n Voters can see through Democrats\u2019 deception. They know what this is really about: a federal power grab that will fundamentally transform our electoral system.\n Americans\u00a0overwhelmingly support the very policies the Freedom to Cheat Act would repeal.\u00a0Sixty-eight percent\u00a0of voters believe that state legislatures should decide the voting rules and regulations for their state, not the federal government. Similarly, support for voter ID laws has\u00a0risen 13 percentage points among Black Americans\u00a0and stands at 81% among all voters. In fact, by a\u00a033-point margin, Americans believe that voting in their area is \u201ceasy\u201d and want the main objective of any reforms to focus on making sure elections are \u201cfair and free of voter fraud.\u201d\n \u00a0Despite its noble \u2014 but false \u2014 name, the Freedom to Vote Act is simply another partisan power grab by the federal government. Trust in our institutions, particularly our electoral systems, is vital to the stability and future of our republic. It\u2019s essential we restore that faith by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat\u2014not by abolishing these safeguards entirely.\n \n Kyle Hupfer is general counsel for the Republican National Committee.",

Council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) and Ward 3 Democratic nominee Matthew Frumin have advanced. Even a cursory read of The Post's Metro section each day makes that abundantly clear.  Clifford Johnson Washington  I found the editorial endorsements of the D.C. Council's at-large seats puzzling at best. Elected in 2014 as an independent, Elissa Silverman has served D.C. citizens and workers, fighting for higher minimum wages and paid leave, affordable housing, safer neighborhoods and much more, and all without any corporate donations, unlike those who earned endorsements.  Endorsements by D.C. nurses, public school teachers, grocery workers and Attorney General Karl A. Racine should give voters an idea of the depth of her commitment to serving D.C. citizens. To dismiss her record of service and achievement as an \u201cideological tilt\u201d is an insult to someone who has a long and admirable record of public service.  Mary F. Hanley Washington  In 2016, D.C. voters approved a referendum endorsing statehood for the District of Columbia, with almost 80 percent supporting it. Despite years of advocating for full citizenship and voting rights for D.C., The Post inexplicably ignored this overwhelming expression of the popular will in D.C., endorsing a candidate who supports \u201cretrocession\u201d of D.C. to Maryland . Neither Maryland nor D.C. supports retrocession.  We in D.C. should not have to give up our very existence to right the 221-year-old error that today disenfranchises 700,000 people.  As Post editorials and op-eds have repeatedly explained, statehood for D.C. can be achieved by an act of Congress (like that for the 37 states admitted since the Constitution was ratified). The Post should be consistent in its support of H.R. 51 and endorse only those candidates who actually believe in the will of D.C. voters on this question central to D.C. and democracy.  Lorelie S.

That would effectively freeze offseason activities that involve players, including signings. Depending on subsequent negotiations and potential litigation, MLB and MLBPA could remain in a labor dispute into 2022. Spring training is scheduled to start on Feb. 26, and Opening Day is set for March 31.  More from Sportico.com  A labor dispute that ends shortly before the start of the season, one agent tells Sportico , could spark a chaotic situation. Teams would rush to sign free agents and possibly give players and agents less time to weigh offers. That frenzy might benefit some players while others lose out as teams act quickly, opting not to wait around. One front office executive, contacted by Sportico , shared a similar perspective, noting that some agents likely believe they would thrive in the \u201cchaos\u201d of a post-lockout period, while others will prioritize stability and strike a deal this month.  Adding to the uncertainty are the \u201cknown unknowns.\u201d It's impossible to know currently the terms of a future CBA, for instance.

    "body": "President Biden on Sunday signed a sweeping executive order instructing federal agencies to advance Democrat Party objectives for U.S. elections, using the agencies to provide information about voter registration and vote-by-mail applications, including for federal prisoners.\n\nThe Biden administration asserted\u00a0the federal government plays a primary role in providing education about voter registration and combating \u201cmisinformation.\u201d His administration is devoted to promoting and defending \u201cthe right to vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in elections,\u201d he states in the order.\n\nOne of the main objectives listed in the executive action is providing prisoners with educational materials related to voting and facilitating voter registration for eligible prisoners \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe educational materials should also notify individuals leaving Federal custody of the restrictions, if any, on their ability to vote under the laws of the State where the individual resides and, if any such restrictions exist, the point at which the individual\u2019s rights will be restored under applicable State law,\u201d the order states.\n\nThe order also instructs the attorney general to establish procedures requiring jails to facilitate voting by mail \u201cto the extent practicable and appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General shall establish procedures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure the United States Marshals Service includes language in intergovernmental agreements and jail contracts to require the jails to provide educational materials related to voter registration and voting, and to facilitate voting by mail, to the extent practicable and appropriate. The Attorney General shall establish procedures, consistent with applicable law, for coordinating with the Probation and Pretrial Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide educational materials related to voter registration and voting to all eligible individuals under the supervision of the Probation and Pretrial Services Office, and to facilitate voter registration and voting by such individuals. The Attorney General shall take appropriate steps, consistent with applicable law, to support formerly incarcerated individuals in obtaining a means of identification that satisfies State voter identification laws, including as required by 18 U.S.C. 4042(a)(6)(B).\n\nBeyond the focus on prisoner outreach, the order effectively instructs federal agencies to promote voter registration on a national scale, informing Americans about voting via federal agency websites. It also states the administration\u2019s intention of \u201csoliciting and facilitating approved, nonpartisan third-party organizations and State officials to provide voter registration services on agency premises.\u201d In a practical sense, this could largely drive up turnout for Democrat voters. Those receiving welfare benefits, for example, could receive voter registration information directly from federal employees working with the agencies. That, combined with the administration\u2019s devotion to combating \u201cmisinformation,\u201d will further maximize Big Tech\u2019s role in the U.S. elections \u2014 a primary concern among GOP voters and lawmakers.\n\n\u201cBut many Americans, especially people of color, confront significant obstacles to exercising that fundamental right [to vote],\u201d the order states, citing obstacles including \u201cdifficulties with voter registration, lack of election information, and barriers to access at polling places.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Democrats, that translates to their repeated attempts to dismantle basic election integrity measures and restrictions, including voter ID laws. Democrats routinely brand these basic election integrity measures as forms of voter suppression.\n\nBiden\u2019s executive order comes as Democrat lawmakers promote H.R. 1, or the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d which effectively federalizes U.S. elections. The Democrat-led House passed the controversial measure last week.\n\nTwenty attorneys general, led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R), sent a letter to House and Senate leaders last week, warning they will take appropriate legal action in the event of the legislation becoming law.\n\n\u201c[H.R. 1] basically codifies everything that was irregular or outright wrong or the opportunities for fraud during last year\u2019s election and makes it the law of the land,\u201d Rokita said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily last week. \u201cIt takes out the balance between integrity and accountability and access to polling places.\u201d\n\n\u201cH.R. 1 makes photo ID illegal in the United States. Meanwhile, it mails out live ballots to everyone on the voting list \u2014 alive or dead \u2014 and it makes it much more difficult for states to take dead people off the voting rolls, to take people who moved away off of voting rolls,\u201d he added.",

It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report on the potential benefits and harms of marijuana use to Congress. And key to SAM's criteria for the proposed legislation is that marijuana is not legalized by the bill and remains on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. \u201cThe Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act demonstrates that we can lower barriers to marijuana research without descheduling and legalizing marijuana,\u201d said Kevin Sabet, Ph.D., president and CEO of SAM, on July 26. \u201cUnlike bills like the SAFE Banking Act, MORE Act, and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, this legislation represents needed and meaningful reform to marijuana research.\u201d If marijuana is being presented as medication, it should be treated and researched as such, added Sabet. \u201cWe encourage component treatments that are FDA-approved, prescribed by a physician, and dispensed by a pharmacy.

Smash-and-grab thefts plastering our local news day after day have surpassed petty shoplifting. What we\u2019re seeing is professional stealing or, more accurately, organized retail crime, and it\u2019s proving to be dangerous to businesses and consumers alike.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe crime goes beyond the theft of commercial goods. As Homeland Security Investigations Dallas Special Agent Christopher Miller puts it, \"Organized retail crime leads to consumers having to pay higher prices for goods, fewer job openings, and a decrease in consumer spending on legitimate goods that small-business owners and other retailers depend on for survival.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s bad for businesses everywhere, but it is especially pervasive in the Lone Star state. So much so that the National Retail Federation named Houston one of the top 10 cities impacted by organized retail crime in 2021. In just one instance at the height of the pandemic, Houston police uncovered more than $1 million worth of stolen merchandise stored from floor to ceiling in one resident\u2019s single-family home alone.\u00a0 \u00a0\nEven more disturbing is that our problem is spanning state lines. An Illinois man was recently found guilty of operating a $20 million crime ring that stole goods from a number of Texas retail stores and fenced them online through e-commerce platforms to generate more than $11 million in profit. Crossing Texas\u2019 border with illicit items and selling them online meant that Homeland Security Investigations Dallas had to join forces with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Illinois\u2019 Arlington Heights Police Department to close this case.\u00a0\u00a0\nICE LAUNCHES PUSH TO CRACK DOWN ON ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME AMID SURGE IN SMASH-AND-GRAB ATTACKS ON STORES\n \n      This undated image released by the California Attorney General's Office shows stolen items from Bay Area retailers, recovered in a warehouse in Concord, Calif., where a search warrant was executed by California law enforcement authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Spurred by a recent run of large-scale smash-and-grab robberies, prosecutors and retailers are pushing back on assertions by California's governor and attorney general that they have enough tools to combat retail theft in the wake of a voter-approved easing of related laws.\u00a0\n      ((California Attorney General's Office via AP))\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThanks to the internet and its accessibility, the impact of retail theft is becoming less localized, and cases like the Illinois ringleader\u2019s that involves a state-spanning network of law enforcement at the state and federal level are becoming all too common. It's time this national problem be met with national policy, starting with H.R. 5502 \u2014 The Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers (INFORM Consumers) Act\u00a0\u2014\u00a0currently being considered in the broader China competitiveness package. It has broad, bipartisan support in Congress. \u00a0\nIf passed, the INFORM Consumers Act would essentially help dissuade these retail crime rings empowered by the anonymity of the internet by requiring them to verify their identity; including their name, tax ID, bank account information and contact information. Moreover, it protects consumers from stolen and counterfeit goods without unnecessarily imposing undue burden on small online businesses.\u00a0\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe INFORM Consumers Act is a common-sense piece of legislation that, in addition to earning the praise of law enforcement, has brought opposing political parties and competing industries together in support. It\u2019s a sensible solution we can all get behind. Let\u2019s not wait to give Texas and the country a reprieve from organized retail crime and pass the INFORM Consumers Act. The committee reviewing this omnibus package must include H.R. 5502 in its final version.\u00a0\u00a0\n  Former sheriff A.J. Louderback is a 43-year law enforcement veteran who served five terms as sheriff of Jackson County, Texas.",

    "body": "The Big Cat Public Safety Act, previously supported by \"Tiger King\" star and animal rights activist Carole Baskin, is headed to President Biden's desk after the Senate unanimously approved the bill on Tuesday.\n\nThe piece of legislation seeks to build upon previous legislation to prohibit the ownership of big cats as pets and keep them from being exposed to photo opportunities and public petting.\n\n\"This bill has been one of the most important projects during my time in Congress. Since 2019, we have been working on this legislation and last night, I was so proud to see the Senate push it across the finish line. I believe in this bill, as do countless animal rights groups and law enforcement agencies who will benefit from its passage,\" Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., said in a statement. \"I look forward to President Biden signing this bill into law.\"\n\nThe bill was passed by the House in July, in a 278 to 134 vote. The Senate received the legislation in early August, conducting two readings before it was passed.\n\nCAROLE BASKIN SAYS HOUSE PASSING BIG CAT PUBLIC SAFETY ACT IS 'ONLY SILVER LINING TO TIGER KING'\n\nThe legislation prohibits any \"import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce\" and the breeding or possessing of such wildlife. Possession of big cats and cross-breeds would be limited to wildlife sanctuaries and state universities, as well as certified zoos.\n\nThe bill's text states animals on display must be kept at least 15 feet away from the public unless a \"permanent barrier\" is present that would prove sufficient to prevent public contact.\n\nHOUSE PASSES 'TIGER KING' BILL TO OUTLAW PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF BIG CATS\n\nCurrent owners of big cats will be able to keep their animals but are prohibited from breeding, selling or acquiring any of the prohibited wildlife species. They are also banned from allowing their animals to engage in contact with the public and must register the cat with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within 180 days of the bill's enactment.\n\n\"The Administration supports H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would build on existing laws that protect big cats like tigers, cheetahs, jaguars, and other wild animals living in captivity in the United States,\" President Biden said in a statement released in late July. \"The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to take additional steps to protect the public and imperiled large cats through H.R. 263, as it proceeds through the legislative process.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBaskin also visited Capitol Hill several times as the bill made its way through the legislative process, meeting with several lawmakers and key staff.\n\n'TIGER KING' STAR JOE EXOTIC RESENTENCED TO 21 YEARS IN PRISON\n\n\"For me, this fight for the big cats was never personal,\" said Baskin in a statement released. \"This was always about developing a national policy to shut down the trade in these animals as props in commercial cub handling operations and as pets in people\u2019s backyards and basements.\"",

    "body": "By Larry Keane\nGun collectors, beware. Certain Members of Congress believe if an individual buys too many guns, too much ammunition or too many accessories, that person is a potentially dangerous criminal or a \u201cdomestic terrorist.\u201d\n They also want banks to tell on anyone who might be buying too much.\n U.S. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and U.S. Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), and Jennifer Wexton, (D-Va.) introduced The Gun Violence Prevention Through Financial Intelligence Act,\u00a0H.R. 5764, in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate as\u00a0S. 3117. The\u00a0legislation\u00a0is troublesome because the politicians authoring it pitch it as a means to detect and prevent those who might be planning to commit an atrocity or terror attack. The bill is fraught with civil liberty violations and not just those freedoms protected by the Second Amendment. Privacy rights \u2013 specifically those related to finances \u2013 would go by the wayside.\n The bill would require the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) to give guidance to banks so they can report \u201csuspicious financial activity.\u201d According to Sen. Markey, this undefined suspicious financial activity could be a warning sign an individual is planning a horrific crime or terror event.\n  \u201cWe cannot allow banks and financial institutions to turn a blind eye as shooters bank a pile of guns and ammunition in a lead up to an attack,\u201d Sen. Markey said in a\u00a0press statement.\u00a0\u201cThe Gun Violence Prevention Through Financial Intelligence Act will give us the guidance on how these institutions can help pinpoint and prevent gun violence across the country.\u201d\n Government Snooping\n The proposed legislation doesn\u2019t define what level of financial activity is suspicious or how many firearms and accessories is \u201ctoo many\u201d or how much ammunition is \u201ctoo much.\u201d Instead, it leaves that to be determined by Treasury Department officials. In other words, these Members of Congress would delegate the work defining what would allow the government to peer inside banking records. Those Treasury Department bureaucrats would provide \u201cguidance\u201d to banks to report that \u201csuspicious\u201d activity. Media report gun seizures of several guns as \u201carsenals,\u201d making anyone owning more than two or three guns seem suspect.\n Like all Americans, those in the firearm industry are concerned about terrorism. Licensed retailers cooperate with law enforcement all the time and report suspicious activity. However, this bill is similar to the federal government snooping around libraries and bookstores to see what books people are reading and what websites are visited. It is a deeply troubling intrusion into the civil liberties of gun owners and the exercise of their Second Amendment rights that should trouble all Americans.\n \n This legislation should be recognized for what it is \u2013 another attempt by lawmakers to circumvent civil rights and co-opting financial institutions to advance an anti-gun agenda. The Obama administration illegally coerced banks to unlawfully discriminate against the firearm industry through Operation Chokepoint. That was the effort by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to pressure financial institutions to stop lending and providing banking services to firearm-related businesses by labelling those business \u201chigh risk\u201d despite having no evidence or justification. Now, Congressional gun control advocates would order banks to spy on their customers for them.\n Tried Before, Trying Again\n Rep. Wexton and Rep. Dean introduced similar legislation in the last Congress. Their bill was\u00a0H.R.\u00a05132,\u00a0the Gun Violence Prevention Through Financial Intelligence Act, that Rep. Wexton explained to voters in a town hall would explore \u201cwhether credit card transactions could be used as a warning tool for mass shootings,\u201d according to The\u00a0Prince Williams Times.\u00a0That was an idea that Shannon Watts\u00a0endorsed.\u00a0She, of course, is the head of antigun billionaire Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Moms Demand Action. Watts authored an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0in Business Insider pressuring credit card companies to deny purchases for firearm parts, to stem the sale of what she termed \u201cghost guns.\u201d\n It was also an idea that failed presidential and Senate candidate Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u00a0wanted to pursue, after he learned about it from The New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, who wrote about it in\u00a02018\u00a0and\u00a02017.\n The bill is also coming on the heels of the Biden administration being forced to step back from a proposal to\u00a0monitor financial transactions\u00a0on every American above $600 on every American bank account. NSSF\u00a0warned\u00a0that this was a bad omen for an administration bent on enforcing their radical gun control plan, even if it means sacrificing privacy rights.\n Rep. Wexton\u2019s bill moved nowhere in the last Congress. NSSF is working to make sure it doesn\u2019t go anywhere in this one.\n                                                                Larry Keane is Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs and General Counsel for the\u00a0National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association.",

It\u2019s S.1 on the Senate side,\u00a0H.R. 1 on the House side. \u2026 It\u2019s an 800-page monstrosity that would lead to the federal takeover of the running of elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this bill passes, it puts in all these terrible provisions,\u201d von Spakovsky added. \u201cIt\u2019s a federal micromanagement of the election process, and everything that folks on the left want to reduce the integrity [and] the security of the election process is in there.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky added, \u201cIf\u00a0you\u2019re a state like Alabama or Texas that has a voter ID law, you might as well forget it, because this federal law would override all state voter ID laws so they\u2019re now unenforceable.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky highlighted how the For the People Act would increase the difficulty for states to compare voter rolls to prevent citizens from voting in multiple states.\n\n\u201cIt makes it\u00a0almost impossible for states to compare their statewide voter registration list with that of other states to try to find people who are registered and voting in more than one state. They make that as difficult as possible,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cStates do such a poor job of maintaining the voter rolls,\u201d added von Spakovsky. \u201cOne of the worst things is they\u2019re not cooperating with other states to find the people, for example, who\u2019ve lived in New York but have vacation homes down in Florida, and are voting in both places, which is highly illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they doing that?\u201d von Spakovsky asked. \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason, and that\u2019s to make it easier to cheat.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.",

Joe Manchin (D) \u2014 disavowing H.R. 1/S. 1 (also called the For the People Act).\n\nManchin, who often holds out on legislation held dear to the far-left-wing of the Democrat Party, would play a key role in passing the For the People Act, especially due to his position on the filibuster. S.1\u2019s passage relies on a super-majority vote \u2014 support from 60 out of 100 senators \u2014 so Democrat\u2019s slim majority in the Senate is not enough to pass the bill.\n\n\u201cWV\u00a0Secretary of State Warner is getting a lot of attention already in WV for speaking out again[st] HR 1 and is testifying today. Warner is a \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 guy so there\u2019s lots we could and need to do,\u201d Minkoff-Zern wrote in the Slack channel.\n\nHe continued, quoting alleged guidance from For West Virginia\u2019s Future, which reportedly advised the coalition to \u201cdiscredit Warner\u2019s reputation\u201d and emphasize \u201chis work spreading the Big Lie.\u201d They also advised to keep Manchin out of the campaign and to avoid \u201cnationalizing the convo by mentioning Republicans or Biden.\u201d:\n\nDo we have or could folks create some talking points and sample posts that are ready to go and we could share around using the following guidance from our friends with For West Virginia\u2019s Future: \u201cMy general suggestion is two-fold: 1) Discredit Warner\u2019s reputation as much as possible ahead of the hearing for his work spreading the Big Lie and current misinformation inside WV. 2) Redirect any false talking point he presents inside the hearing a la Race Class Narrative \u2013 don\u2019t spend time repeating his falsehoods, instead talk about what the act means for everyday Americans and how folks like Warner are stopping that for their own selfish political reason, aka he\u2019s showing us why this Act is so important. General recommendations: avoid nationalizing the convo by mentioning Republicans or Biden, don\u2019t draw Manchin in on this, and don\u2019t spend any time repeating his lies\u2026\u201d\n\nLauren Bowman, spokeswoman for PILF, confirmed to Breitbart News that while Cook did not direct activists in the group to smear Warner, her \u201cinvolvement in a [S]lack group is deliberate.\u201d\u00a0PILF reportedly did not find any proof within the confines of the public records request that any other politicians or aides were involved in the channel.\n\n\u201cIt is no surprise that leftist organizations would work to attack and discredit people who do not agree with them. This is their M.O. It is shocking that a government aide would be involved in this and that a Secretary of State\u2019s office would be involved in attacking another Secretary of State,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cThe Maine Secretary of State\u2019s office and Emily Cook clearly did not want this information to be publicly available. Otherwise, they would not have been involved in a [S]lack group that is a non-public communication tool.\u201d\n\nBowman told Breitbart News that Cook was Bellows\u2019 only staff member in the Slack channel and that the message from Minkoff-Zern was the only one of its kind found in the 590-page public records request. PILF reportedly did not reach out to the Maine Secretary of State\u2019s Office upon discovery of Cook\u2019s presence in the Slack channel.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to Cook and to Bellow for comment, asking if they wished to respond to the accusation. Breitbart News also asked if it is the typical practice of the Maine Secretary of State\u2019s office to collaborate with partisan organizations who discredit government officials with differing opinions and if any disciplinary action had been taken. Neither Cook nor Bellows responded to a request for comment by the time of publication. It is also unclear if Cook is still a part of the Slack channel.\n\nWarner\u2019s office had no knowledge of the alleged attempted smear campaign when Breitbart News reached out for comment on Monday, though\u00a0Director of Communications for Secretary Warner Mike Queen said he was \u201cdisappointed to think that something like this could be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile they may disagree at times on policy issues, Secretary Warner has always respected Secretary Bellows. And I believe that feeling is mutual,\u201d Queen said. \u201cIf I was ever part of coordinating a secret smear campaign behind Secretary Warner\u2019s back and against another Secretary of State, I\u2019d be looking for another job the same day Secretary Warner found out what I was doing.\u201d\n\nAs for the For the People Act, Manchin ended up being the only Democrat hold-out. A slimmer bill was later introduced, called the Freedom to Vote Act, which is co-sponsored by Manchin and reportedly addresses his qualms with the previous version. Republicans successfully blocked the legislation from passing on October 20, voting 49-51 to end debate. It is the second time Republicans have filibustered to prevent a Democrat voting bill from advancing, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)\u00a0voted against advancing it so that he could bring it up for a vote again in the future.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

    "body": "There are not many people who know exactly why FBI agents searched Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday.\nThe FBI knows, certainly, and the former president and his attorneys likely have a good sense as well, given that they saw the search warrant. Everyone else is operating on what's been revealed by Trump's team and public reporting: The FBI search was largely or entirely a function of the investigation into Trump's retention of documents after leaving the White House.  We know that he did, by his own admission. Earlier this year, a number of boxes of material were turned over to the National Archives. Included in that material were some that were classified. On Monday, the FBI removed another dozen boxes, with speculation rampant that more of that material was similarly restricted.  If Trump is found to have violated federal law in removing and retaining classified documents without authorization, he could be convicted of a felony punishable by five years in prison. And that conviction would be a felony carrying that punishment because of a law signed by President Donald Trump.  Trump's 2016 campaign was intertwined with a similar question. His Democratic opponent, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, had been found to have operated a private email server that she used for official business \u2014 including, the FBI determined, some that was classified. Trump and his allies pushed for Clinton to face criminal charges but, in July 2016, FBI Director James B. Comey announced that the FBI wouldn't seek an indictment. Trump was furious, but he won anyway.  During his first year in office, a central tool used for surveillance by the intelligence community \u2014 Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act \u2014 was set to expire. Shortly before it did, Congress passed an extension of the authority for another five years.  But that didn't come without turmoil. Trump came into office angry at the intelligence community for revealing to reporters that it believed Russia had interfered in the 2016 election. He excoriated intelligence agencies on Twitter \u2014 and continued to do so as the contours of the investigation into that interference became clear.  On the day that the House was set to vote on the reauthorization, Trump complained on Twitter:  (That initial phrase is in quotes because Trump, characteristically, was responding to something he saw on Fox News.)  The tweet freaked out advocates of the extension. A few hours later, he tweeted his support and it passed. On Jan. 18, 2018, he signed it into law.  What became law was S. 139. It had been introduced by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) as the \"Rapid DNA Act of 2017.\" But sometimes Congress hollows out existing legislation and replaces it entirely with other legislation to move the process forward more quickly. So S. 139 was replaced with H.R. 4478, which extended Section 702 for another five years.  It also had a stipulation editing 18 U.S. Code \u00a71924. It originally read:  With Trump's signing S. 139 into law, that became: \" \u2026 shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years , or both .\" And, with that, it became a felony.  You can see how Trump absconding with classified material to Mar-a-Lago would facially violate the law as articulated. So Trump's allies have already been offering a rationalization: Trump had declassified everything he took to Mar-a-Lago.  In an interview on Fox News Tuesday night, former Trump administration official Kash Patel made this case.  \"What I can tell you definitively is that President Trump was a transparency president,\" Patel said when asked if there was any classified material at Trump's Florida estate. \"And time and time again \u2026 we tried to get all of it out. And President Trump, on multiple occasions at the White House, declassified whole sets of documents. Including \u2014 I remind you and your audience that around October of 2020, he issued a statement from the White House declassifying every document related to not just the Russiagate scandal, but also the Hillary Clinton email scandal.\"  Trump did, in fact, order the wholesale declassification of a number of documents related to those investigations, including on the day before he left office. At that point, though, the order was to declassify documents that had been cleared by the FBI a few days prior.  In an interview with Breitbart in May (at the time reports about classified material at Mar-a-Lago first emerged), Patel made a slightly different argument.  \"Trump declassified whole sets of materials in anticipation of leaving government that he thought the American public should have the right to read themselves,\" he said. \"The White House counsel failed to generate the paperwork to change the classification markings, but that doesn't mean the information wasn't declassified.\"  In other words, Trump declassified a bunch of stuff, even if there isn't record of it. This, obviously is very convenient \u2014 but also not completely ridiculous.  In 2017, on the day after he fired Comey, Trump welcomed senior Russian officials into the Oval Office for a meeting. During that discussion, he revealed to them classified information. That report spurred an unexpected defense as articulated by Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and others: the president has full authority to declassify things and can, in essence, do so on the fly. Fact-checkers considered this idea \u2026 and determined it to be largely accurate.  We're trudging toward a very gray area here, clearly, but it is conceivable that Trump's defense against his potential possession of classified material at Mar-a-Lago may be that he declassified it while still president, even if no formal record of the declassification was made. This introduces a slew of other questions, since that material would now presumably be publicly available in some form.  \"The president has unilateral authority to declassify documents \u2014 anything in government,\" Patel told Breitbart. \"He exercised it here in full.\"  Patel was one of the administration's most loyal defenders during Trump's presidency. As a staffer to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Patel was intimately involved in the congressman's fervent effort to push back against the investigation into Russian interference. Nunes was also a critic of Clinton's handling of her email server, suggesting at one point in 2016 that he hoped \"the irresponsible handling of classified information documented by the FBI will be considered if any of these individuals currently possesses a security clearance or applies for one in the future.\"  H.R. 4478, the legislation that became S. 139 and which escalated the punishment for the retention of classified material, was introduced in the House by Nunes.",

She noted that no Republican voted for the bill and that it\u2019s not likely to pass through the Senate, citing Republican criticism. She then asked Cruz about the \u201cincendiary comments\u201d being thrown at Republicans for opposing D.C. statehood, such as Democratic New York Rep. Mondaire Jones calling their objections \u201cracist trash.\u201d\n Cruz responded that the Democrats\u2019 \u201cgo-to attack\u201d is to accuse anyone who disagrees with them \u201cof being a racist,\u201d and that they\u2019re \u201cdeliberately playing on racial divisions\u201d in the country. He then said that\u00a0their push for D.C. statehood was \u201cpart of a broader effort\u201d to \u201cmaintain power.\u201d\n \u201cWe have Democratic control of the White House and both houses of Congress, and their number one priority, it\u2019s not Covid, it\u2019s not vaccinations, it\u2019s not reopening jobs, it\u2019s not getting kids back in school, it\u2019s not doing anything substantive. Their number one priority is they want to stay in power forever,\u201d he continued.\n \u201cSo you look at what they\u2019re pushing. They\u2019re pushing D.C. statehood. Why? Because they want two new Democratic senators,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing H.R. 1, what many are calling the Corrupt Politicians Act, because they want to federalize elections, they want to register millions of illegal aliens and felons to vote, and keep Democrats in power for the next 100 years, and they want to pack the U.S. Supreme Court and add four new left-wing justices because they want to change the rules and maintain power.\u201d\n Cruz later argued that the chances of packing the Supreme Court and admitting D.C. as a state were \u201czero\u201d as long as the Senate filibuster rule remained in effect. He added that as long as it takes 60 votes to move legislation forward, then the bills would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate.\n \n \u201cThe Democrats know that. That\u2019s why they want to change, blow up the Senate rules, end the filibuster in order to change the fundamental election rules. And so it all comes down to really Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the lone two Democrats who\u2019ve said they wouldn\u2019t end the filibuster,\u201d Cruz concluded. \u201cIf they end the filibuster they will make D.C. a state. If they end the filibuster they will pack the Supreme Court. This is all about power and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much pressure on those two Democratic senators.\u201d\n Many Democrats have voiced their support in eliminating the Senate filibuster rule, which requires legislation to pass with a 60 vote majority, so that many of their key policy bills can pass, including D.C. statehood and changes to federal election law. Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Democratic Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema have both said they oppose eliminating the filibuster.",

McMaster on Sunday blasted the storming of the Capitol last Jan. 6 as an \u201cassault\u201d on the government \u2014 flatly contradicting the glowing perspective of events by the Republican National Committee last week.  Asked on CBS' \u201cFace The Nation\u201d if he believed the RNC was \u201cin any way\u201d accurate when it defined the Jan. 6 riot as \u201clegitimate political discourse,\u201d McMasters responded: \u201cNo. It was illegitimate political discourse because it was an assault on the first branch of government.\u201d  Some 140 police officers were injured in the attack , and more than 740 people at the Capitol that day have been arrested.  McMaster also said that former Vice President Mike Pence was \u201cabsolutely\u201d correct to say in a speech last week that Trump was \u201cwrong\u201d that Pence had the power to throw out the results of the 2020 election that day to help his former boss.  Pence added: \u201cFrankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.\u201d  All Americans \u201cshould agree with Pence,\u201d said McMaster, and \u201cdemand more from our political leaders \u2014 demand that they stop compromising confidence in our democratic principles and institutions and processes to score partisan, political points.\u201d  McMaster was one of a few additional Republicans who came out of the woodwork over the weekend to support Pence \u2014 or condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection following the RNC's attempt to redefine history as it censured Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) for daring to serve on the House committee probing the insurrection.  Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d that he was \u201cglad\u201d Pence finally spoke out about Trump's pressure to toss out the election.  \u201cLet's face it. Let's call it what it is,\u201d said the former Trump ally, referring to Jan. 6. It \u201cwas a riot that was incited by Donald Trump in an effort to intimidate Mike Pence and the Congress into doing exactly what he said in his own words last week: \u2018Overturn the election.'\u201d  Sen. John Barrasso ( R-Wyo.) said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Pence \u201cdid his constitutional duty that day.

    "body": "government relations and policy director at the liberal National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. \u201cI think this is something that, at least in the advocacy community, people had anticipated this and know that this was going to be a likely outcome. I think there's still going to be a bill, but it may not be as ambitious as we would have liked.\u201d Democrats want to pass the bill using the budget reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes in the Senate. But with the Senate divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, there are no votes to spare. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has been pushing a provision in the bill to add dental, vision, and hearing benefits to Medicare. Other Democrats, many from Southern states, are pushing for the federal government to cover the roughly 4.4 million poor people from the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. The American Rescue Plan passed by Congress in March included $36 billion to expand for two years of subsidies for insurance premiums on Obamacare exchanges. Democrats are hoping to extend those subsidies for another 10 years in the spending package. The total cost of these expansions over 10 years is about $600 billion. But centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have balked at the spending bill. Manchin has suggested that Congress take a \u201cstrategic pause\u201d on the legislation until possibly 2022, and Sinema has said she could not support spending $3.5 trillion. Reducing the amount spent on the overall bill would also mean reducing spending on the healthcare provisions. The resistance of Manchin and Sinema are not the only threats to these healthcare proposals. Much of the funding to pay for it was supposed to come from H.R. 3, \u201cThe Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,\u201d which would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate on prescription drugs for the first time. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this was supposed to save the federal government over $450 billion over 10 years. Whether that bill will pass the House seems increasingly unlikely. The House Ways and Means Committee passed the bill last week, but it failed to clear the Energy and Commerce Committee, where four centrist Democrats opposed it. Back in May, 10 Democrats signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing reservations about the bill. Democrats have 220 members in the House to the GOP's 212, which means that they can afford only three defections if they are to pass H.R. 3. \u201cThe Democratic leadership has a couple of options,\u201d said Doug Badger, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cFirst, they could pressure moderates who opposed the price control provision in committee to back passage on the floor. More likely, they will try to cobble together a price control package that gives them less savings and scale back the other expansions.\u201d Badger suggested that Democrats would most likely scale back the Obamacare subsidies, extending for them for only three or four years. \u201cDemocrats will be betting that a future Congress won't let the program expire,\u201d Badger said. Adcock thought it would be possible for Democrats to come up with most of the money for the healthcare proposals by finding it in other parts of the spending bill. Yet, that would require eliminating other spending proposals in the bill. He conceded that it would be \u201ca monumental task in terms of negotiation.\u201d Another possibility is that Democrats remove these provisions from the spending bill and vote on them later as stand-alone bills. But the chances of that seem remote. \u201cIt's possible, but [Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer] is generally reluctant to bring a bill to the floor that would be open to amendment and debate. He would need an ironclad commitment from 10 GOP senators to prevent amendment and debate,\u201d said Badger. Adcock also thought it was unlikely. \u201cI think it still would have to be done under budget reconciliation because I think it's unlikely that Democrats would get Republicans to vote for those kind of benefit improvements,\u201d said Adcock.

The bill provides much-needed support to America's hospitality industry, a massive sector of the economy employing tens of millions of Americans, which has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"The nation's hospitality industry has been decimated by the pandemic. Business owners and hospitality industry employees have been some of the hardest hit by restaurant closures, event cancellations and restricted travel due to COVID-19.

As shutdowns continued, small businesses suffered significant losses in spoiled inventory that could no longer be sold or repurposed for charity. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Kevin Cramer and Representatives Steven Horsford and Darin LaHood understand the devastating impact of the pandemic on hospitality sector businesses across America and are working to address the needs of these businesses by introducing the Hospitality and Commerce Job Recovery Act of 2021.

McMaster fired, though the Times noted that it is unclear if Project Veritas was involved. Project Veritas denies involvement.The plan was to secretly record McMaster disparaging Trump to undermine him.McMaster, a former general, previously served as Trump's National Security Advisor.A group of conspirators planned an ultimately unsuccessful undercover sting operation to try to oust former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Project Veritas, who had investigated employees at the FBI and other government employees as part of their \"Deep State Unmasked\" investigation, denies it was involved in the McMaster operation and the New York Times noted that it is unclear if the group directed the operation.The controversial conservative group, led by provocateur and self-styled media watchdog James O'Keefe, dedicates resources to surreptitiously recording government employees, Democratic campaign professionals, and members of the mainstream media.McMaster's background as a general and record in the foreign policy establishment led groups like Project Veritas to derisively designate him as part of the \"deep state\" and his approach to foreign policy as \"globalist\" and at odds with Trump's \"America First\" positioning, The Times said.While the plan to expose and oust McMaster was being formed in 2018, Trump was critical of what he described as \"the deep state\" and the law enforcement apparatus that was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.The idea to go undercover to get McMaster fired from the White House began after a November 2017 article in Buzzfeed News reported that McMaster referred to Trump as an \"idiot,\" \"dope,\" and someone with smarts on par with a kindergardener at a dinner in Washington, DC, The New York Times reported. (McMaster and others present at the event denied that he made such comments at the time).Per the Times, the conspirators then devised a plot to have a woman go to the same place to have a woman go to the same place, a high-end Italian restaurant called Tosca, with a hidden camera to engage McMaster in conversation and share a few drinks with him in the hope to catch him saying something similarly disparaging about Trump.Read more: A Trump prosecution would mean security nightmares in New York, Atlanta, and Washington, DCThe Times reported that Project Veritas planned to pay a woman named Tarah Price $10,000 to be the uncover subject, citing emails written by Price's ex-boyfriend to a group called Expose Project Veritas.But the plan became moot when McMaster left the administration of his own volition in March of 2018. He was replaced as National Security Advisor by John Bolton.Project Veritas reportedly rented out an elaborate six-bedroom house in Georgetown that went for $10,000 a month as the headquarters for the failed operation and also hired women to go undercover on dates with FBI agents to secretly record them in the hopes that some would trash Trump on tape.The women hired to bait FBI agents made fake dating app profiles, secretly brought reporting equipment to the dates, were given code names like \"Tiger\" and \"Brazil,\" and were told to keep the location of the house top-secret at all costs, The Times reported.",

    "body": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter . You can sign up here to receive it weekdays. We've heard a lot of debate about whether work at an Amazon warehouse should be considered a good job or a bad one. My colleagues Jodi Kantor, Karen Weise and Grace Ashford spent months trying to answer a different question: How well does Amazon manage all those people? What they found was that Amazon's systems for mass-managing its hourly work force are strained and uneven, resulting in high turnover of employees. I encourage you to read their deeply reported investigation , which left me wondering whether Amazon's handling of arguably its most important asset \u2014 its roughly one million employees in the United States, mostly hourly workers \u2014 is effective or sustainable for the company, let alone those people. I spoke with Karen about what she and her colleagues learned, and where Amazon's reputation for supreme efficiency is at odds with the chaos of managing its staff. Shira: You found that Amazon had to replace more than the equivalent of its entire hourly work force in a single year. That is stunning. Is Amazon pushing them out or are they quitting? Advertisement Karen: Both. Amazon hires so many people , often with no in-person interview and little vetting, and it loses a significant number of workers within the first couple of weeks after they're hired. We've heard of people walking out on their lunch break on their first day of orientation. That creates a tremendous amount of turnover and some chaos in the workplace. We also wrote about an employee named Dayana Santos, who had been praised by managers and then was fired for one bad day when for various reasons she wasn't consistently producing. She's someone the company should have wanted to keep. Amazon has since changed the policy that led to her firing, but the example shows that the company has built systems that cannot always effectively assess who is a capable worker. Is the high rate of employee turnover intentional? David Niekerk, a former Amazon vice president who built the warehouse human resources operations, said that Jeff Bezos didn't want lengthy tenure for hourly employees. Company data showed that employees became less engaged over time, and Amazon wanted people who would push to go above and beyond. Maybe Amazon doesn't want to have so many people leave every year, but changing that is not the No. 1 priority, either. Amazon churns through so many employees that I've heard numerous Amazon leaders in Seattle describe a nagging fear that the company will run out of Americans to hire. What does Amazon say about this? Amazon told us that the rate of attrition of workers is just one metric that isn't relevant without context. The company didn't elaborate. Company officials didn't say that it is unacceptable to have 150 percent turnover in a year. Advertisement Let's be real about the dollars and cents. Isn't it costing Amazon a lot of money to replace so many people? It is. And a crucial \u2014 maybe the most important \u2014 factor in Amazon's future growth is not the success of futuristic inventions like delivery drones or home robots . It's how effectively Amazon manages the people who pick, pack and ship all those boxes to our doors. Tech companies talk about \u201cmoonshots,\u201d or doing the seemingly impossible. With Alexa, the company started with a vague idea but put its best people on the project, set incredibly ambitious targets and figured it out . Some Amazon executives at the corporate level and those who oversee the warehouses are asking why managing more than one million humans hasn't been that type of high priority moonshot. Bezos wrote in April that he wanted Amazon to become \u201cEarth's best employer and Earth's safest place to work.\u201d What does he mean? And what actions is Amazon taking? Amazon has talked about the safety part but not as much about the other half of Bezos' statement. Being a great employer is about more than pay, although Amazon has increased hourly wages recently and is paying new-hire bonuses. After we inquired about the company's policies, Amazon also changed its use of a productivity metric that some workers said had been arbitrarily applied. Someone can no longer be fired for one bad day. (Amazon said it had been reconsidering the policy for months.) Are there successful companies that manage hourly workers differently than Amazon? Costco's chief executive testified to Congress that its hourly workers tend to have long tenures. That's a source of pride for Costco. Advertisement Walmart is often criticized for its labor practices and it generally pays less than Amazon, but it says that more than 75 percent of managers at its U.S. stores started as hourly employees. It's extremely challenging to make that jump at Amazon. Sam's Club, which is part of Walmart, trains workers to do multiple jobs in a store. That's partly to keep people feeling fresh in their jobs and learning new skills. Amazon warehouse employees might do the same type of work for 10-hour shifts every day.Before we go \u2026 Cyberattacks are on top of the foreign policy agenda: My colleague David E. Sanger explains why digital hacking was at the top of the agenda for President Biden's meeting Wednesday with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The \u201cdeterrents that kept an uneasy nuclear peace in the Cold War won't work with digital threats,\u201d David writes. What happened when Nigeria banned Twitter: After the government suspended people's ability to access Twitter this month, BuzzFeed News spoke to Nigerians who felt that they lost a lifeline to speak up, connect and organize protests against inequality and violence. We are the gadget guinea pigs: Amazon experiments with selling devices to see how people respond to them, like Alexa eyeglasses and buttons to reorder items like toilet paper. My colleague Brian X. Chen writes about the benefits and risks of Amazon conducting its research and development on the public . (I wrote last month about the difference between worthy real-world tests of new products and reckless ones Hugs to this Esme the cat is an adorable thief . A woman in Oregon put up a clothesline in her yard for her neighbors to retrieve gloves, masks, bathing suits and other items that Esme had cat-burglared from them.

    "body": "According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of healthcare is \"efforts made to maintain or restore physical, mental, or emotional well-being, especially by trained and licensed professionals.\" As stated, healthcare professionals are tasked with the vital job of caring for lives \u2014 not destroying them. Abortion denies this. Its sole aim is to terminate lives, not save them, while posing numerous (even life-threatening) risks to the mother. The aggressive pro-abortion lobby has put the health and safety of women on the back burner time and time again, but its latest scheme \u2014 by-mail, at-home abortion drugs \u2014 is on a whole different level. No matter how hard the lobbyists try and spin it, it's sinister and dangerous. These drugs are designated as high-risk by the Food and Drug Administration, which until recently required that a physician be present when a woman takes these drugs. However, the abortion lobby, along with President Joe Biden's FDA, erased this critical medical safeguard, allowing women to take these high-risk drugs at home, by themselves, without a doctor. While Biden and congressional Democrats celebrate these so-called \u201cadvances\u201d in \u201cwomen's healthcare\u201d that actively threaten mothers' lives, let's not forget that any form of abortion is always a threat to the baby. One of the most glaring problems with the debate about abortion is that both sides often talk past each other, with no mention from the Left as to what abortion really is. They're too caught up in maintaining their own \u201cwoke\u201d talking points to admit it. From conception, each baby created is a unique life, with DNA distinct from the mother. They have their own God-given human dignity and constitutionally guaranteed right to life. Abortion is a direct denial of this reality. To Democrats, these unborn children aren't even worth acknowledging. Eliminating an innocent human life is despicable. It's ugly, and abortion is no exception. Its advocates all too conveniently leave out the gruesome details of abortion procedures used to dispose of the unborn child. They do this on purpose. It should be unconscionable in a modern and free society that unborn babies are put through vacuums or dismembered inside the womb. It should be unimaginable that our own Health and Human Services secretary refused to commit to upholding the law that bans the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortions. These procedures happen after the unborn baby has a heartbeat, after he or she develops pain receptors, and after the baby has arms, legs, fingers, and toes. There can be no doubt that the child in the womb is a distinct, valuable human being. Abortion should be condemned to the highest degree, all while the Left proudly waves its false flag of \u201cabortion rights.\u201d And it should be inconceivable for a governor to support and defend born-alive abortions. It's infanticide, no matter how you spin it. This week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a vote on H.R. 3755, the so-called Women's Health Protection Act of 2021. If enacted, this legislation would allow abortions for any reason and at any time right up to birth. It's abortion on demand! H.R. 3755 would force medical professionals to perform or participate in abortion procedures, regardless of their deeply held religious beliefs. In fact, in one of its first lines, the bill boldly claims that \u201cabortion services are essential to health care.\u201d True healthcare protects both the life of the mother and the life of her unborn child. The procedure of abortion is to remove a human life, and Democrats claim that a practice that ends innocent lives is healthcare. I have dedicated much of my life to defending the rights of the unborn, and I promise always to stand strong in the fight to protect those without a voice. Life is a fundamental and indispensable right gifted to every single human being \u2014 not from the government, but from God.

    "body": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nAmerica is under siege by both cartels and our own politicians. Since day one of his presidency Joe Biden has made it clear that he would rather allow cartels to control our border than be vulnerable to political attacks from the left.\n\nAs a result, we have experienced the largest border security crisis in modern American history. The Secretary of Homeland Security has perpetuated this crisis through \"encounter and release\" policies that ignore our laws and put both Americans and the migrants seeking to come here in danger.\n\nNow, House Republicans have a chance to force the President\u2019s hand to end the crisis and reclaim control of our border from cartels. H.R. 29, the Border Safety and Security Act, will immediately reverse these \"encounter and release\" policies by requiring DHS to instead \"detain or turn away.\"\n\nThis is the border security equivalent of the pandemic-prevention deterrent known as Title 42, which all Republicans have supported \u2013 somewhat imprudently \u2013 as the solution for the border. It was only a Band-Aid solution during the pandemic and a health policy is not a border policy, but it powers make clear the border solution.\n\nREP. ROY INTRODUCES BILL TO BLOCK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AS HOUSE GOP FIRES UP BORDER\n\nThe problem is that the Biden administration has used asylum as the exception to swallow the rule of border security; now hundreds of thousands arrive at our southern border each month.\n\nSecretary Mayorkas has released between 1-2 million illegal migrants into American communities, heavily through an abuse of parole authority which is supposed to be used on a \"case-by-case\" basis.\n\nWe know that in just the first 15 months of the Biden administration, DHS released 836,225 people encountered of the more than 1 million illegal migrants apprehended by CBP not turned away under Title 42 \u2013 some 80 percent.\n\nImmediate release of migrants before adjudication of claims is not only a problem in each case, but also represents a \"pull-factor\" for more illegal migrants. An incomprehensible 4 million migrants have been encountered under the Biden regime, overwhelming border patrol.\n\nAgents have been taken away from patrolling to \"processing\" and this creates security gaps for cartels to traffic in drugs like fentanyl, which killed at least 72,000 Americans in 2021. More, it has allowed cartels to move some 1 million \"got aways\" who evade arrest and are often the more dangerous individuals \u2013 sometimes affiliated with gangs or terrorist organizations.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS ANGERS ARIZONA OFFICIALS BY IGNORING BORDER ON VISIT TO STATE: 'TRYING TO HIDE THE TRUTH'\n\nWe should not accept this. Our laws surrounding asylum were never meant to encourage migrants to make the dangerous journey through hundreds of miles of desert terrain \u2014 driven by cartels that are basically terrorists for hire. Our asylum laws were meant to be a last resort for those fleeing legitimate persecution and had no other options \u2014 not the blueprint for a human trafficking pipeline.\n\nThe Border Safety and Security Act is the solution.\n\nFirst, the bill provides the Secretary of DHS with the authority to turn away illegal migrants without admissible documentation if the Secretary sees it necessary to obtain operational control of the border. Operational control is not a controversial idea and is already required by the \"Secure Fence Act of 2006, which then-Senator Joe Biden and current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for.\n\nTurning away illegal migrants is not a new concept \u2014 the public health authority commonly referred to as \"Title 42\" has allowed DHS to do so since March of 2020. In fact, the Biden administration actually appealed court decisions that would have terminated the policy. Biden\u2019s DHS admits the potential need to turn migrants away because \"we anticipate migration levels will increase as smugglers seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants once the Title 42 public health order is lifted.\"\n\nFREEDOM CAUCUS BILL TAKES BILLIONS FROM UN TO FINISH THE US BORDER WALL\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFurther, H.R. 29 will require DHS to use this \"turn-away\" authority if someone cannot be detained through the pendency of an asylum claim or placed in a program consistent with Migrant Protection Protocols. Current law already requires illegal migrants seeking asylum to be detained through the adjudication of their claim; this closes Biden\u2019s loopholes.\n\nThere will be some who spuriously claim this bill would somehow eliminate asylum, and that is flatly false. Those who claim it are either misinformed or seek to misinform. H.R. 29 corrects the abuse of our asylum laws and allows for migrants to claim asylum \u2013 which is good for America and good for immigrants. Further, it does not do anything DHS is not already either allowed or even required to do under current law.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFrom before time of the Declaration of Independence or our Constitution, America has been a refuge for those seeking freedom from oppression. She should remain so. But we cannot allow laws meant to serve the oppressed to create even more oppression in the false name of compassion.\n\nWe will never solve this border crisis if Congress is not willing to step in and fix the policies causing it. The Border Safety and Security Act is the single best policy we would put forward to do that today.\n\nMayra Flores is a former Texas Congresswoman and is now a Senior Fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

Statehood Act would work.\n\n\n\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser sparred with GOP lawmakers in a congressional hearing on Monday over the arguments on turning the city into the 51st state, as Democrats called for representation in Congress and Republicans dismissed the calls as politically driven.\nThe clashes come as Democrats are pushing the Washington, D.C. Admission\u00a0Act, which would grant the District of Columbia statehood.\nDemocrats say the residents of D.C. deserve to vote in Congress. Republicans decry the push as a political ploy from liberals to try to get two Democratic senators and a voting House member in the left-wing city. Washington\u2019s elected representative to the House, Del. Eleanor Norton Holmes, does not have voting representation that is afforded to other United States lawmakers.\nDEMOCRATS RENEW DC STATEHOOD PUSH THAT WOULD REMAKE NATIONAL POLITICS\n\"We are here to demand that the 220-year history of us not being represented in the capital of our country be corrected,\" Bowser said during the House Oversight Committee and Reform Committee hearing.\nRepublicans hit back, arguing the legislation is unconstitutional.\n\"Should every city have two U.S. senators?\" the top Republican on the committee, Rep. James Comer of Tennessee, asked.\nBowser replied: \"Every American, congressman, who pays taxes deserves representation. Our congresswoman should have a vote and we should have two senators. Citizens of other cities and states in the United States of America have two senators, we do not.\"\nComer accused Democrats of a \"political game.\"\n\"We're going to make the argument, Madam Chair, that many Democrat presidents, many Democrat attorneys general\u00a0have made in the past \u2026 H.R. 51 is an unconstitutional bill,\" Comer said. \"I think that most people here realize that. I think this is another political game that the Democrats are playing, but hopefully \u2026 we can work together in truly bipartisan ways on the things the American people sent us to do.\"\u00a0\nDEM SENATOR INTRODUCES DC STATEHOOD BILL -- BUT EFFORT FACES UPHILL BATTLE\nBowser's decision to testify on the issue comes as D.C. has one of the worst vaccine rollouts in the country. It\u2019s one of just two states or districts, along with Utah, where less than 10% of population has gotten two doses of the vaccine, according to the latest vaccination data from the CDC.\nA popular point of contention from pro-statehood side throughout the hearing was the population of Washington in comparison to other sparsely populated states. With roughly around 712,000 District residents, the city has more inhabitants than both Wyoming, which has about\u00a0582,000 residents, and Vermont at\u00a0623,000.\nAs the debate continued, GOP members of the committee argued that granting statehood to Washington, D.C., would shift the axis of power in Congress even further to the left.\n\"From what I am hearing this Democratic-led Congress is attempting to use a razor-thin majority that it has to entrench itself in power by passing measures such as H.R. 1 to nationalize our elections then moving to add two additional Democrats to the Senate by attempting to make D.C. a state,\" Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. said during the hearing.\nIn the 2020 election, 93% of district residents voted for President\u00a0Biden over Republican Donald Trump.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nD.C. statehood already passed the House\u00a0last June,\u00a0but it died in the GOP-led Senate. House leadership is committed to bringing up statehood for a vote again this year and\u00a0214 Democrats have co-sponsored the legislation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or just about all of the 220-member Democratic caucus.\nWith the Senate now in Democratic hands, Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., is leading the effort there for statehood. So far, his\u00a0statehood legislation\u00a0has 40 of the 50 Democratic senators signed on as co-sponsors. However, without changing\u00a0the legislative filibuster, Carper would need the support of at least 10 Republicans to meet the 60-vote threshold to advance \u2013\u00a0an uphill climb in a divided Senate.\nDemocrats have unsuccessfully pushed statehood before: the New Columbia Admission Act failed in 1993 on the House floor even with a Democrat majority. House Democrats that year split their votes, with 151 in favor and 105 voting against, and\u00a0only one vote in favor from Republicans plus\u00a0a vote in favor from the only independent at the time, the liberal Vermont Rep. Bernie Sanders.\nFox News\u2019 Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A House committee last month unanimously approved the RISE Act, a series of retirement-related provisions that fall under its jurisdiction.  Here are some of the main proposals included in both House and Senate proposals.  Two years after Congress passed a law that ushered in improvements to the U.S. retirement system, lawmakers' efforts to make further enhancements are moving forward \u2014 albeit slowly.  There's bipartisan backing for measures in both the House and Senate that would build on the 2019 Secure Act, which aimed to increase both the ranks of savers and retirement security. While progress on the proposals has been slow, there's hope for action in 2022, say supporters. \u201cAt the end of the first quarter or beginning of second quarter, we could see action on the bills in both chambers,\u201d said Paul Richman, chief government and political affairs officer at the Insured Retirement Institute.  More from Personal Finance:  Who can claim the home-office tax deduction  How to avoid tax bomb when selling your home  Must-know changes for the 2021 tax season  Most recently, the House Education and Labor Committee last month approved the RISE Act (H.R. 5891), a series of retirement-related provisions that fall under its jurisdiction. It has some overlap with another bill \u2014 the so-called Secure Act 2.0 (H.R. 2954), which cleared the House Ways and Means Committee in May. Both were approved unanimously by voice vote.  Meanwhile, there are two bills in the Senate that are similar to those in the House: the Retirement Security and Savings Act (S. 1770) and the Improving Access to Retirement Savings Act (S. 1703). However, neither have received committee consideration yet.  Here are some of the main provisions that are covered in the bills.  Required minimum distributions  The Secure Act changed when required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from retirement accounts must begin to age 72, from 70\u00bd. Under the House proposal, those mandated annual withdrawals wouldn't have to start until age 73 in 2022, and then age 74 in 2029 and age 75 by 2032.  Similarly, the Senate proposal would raise the RMD age to 75 by 2032. It also would waive RMDs for individuals with less than $100,000 in aggregate retirement savings, as well as reduce the penalty for failing to take RMDs to 25% from the current 50%.  Catch-up contributions  Current law allows retirement savers age 50 or older to make so-called catch-up contributions to their retirement savings. On top of the standard annual contribution limits \u2014 $19,500 for 401(k) plans and $6,000 for individual retirement accounts in 2021 \u2014 those who qualify can put an extra $6,500 in their 401(k) or $1,000 in their IRA.  Both the House and Senate proposals aim to expand those amounts , although the specifics differ a bit.  How to retire with with $500,000, $750,000 or $1 million  The House provision would adjust annual catch-up amounts based on inflation, and would expand the 401(k) catch-up to $10,000 for individuals who are age 62, 63 or 64. Workers enrolled in so-called SIMPLE plans would be allowed $5,000 in catch-up contributions, up from the current $3,000.  The Senate provision also would index the IRA amount to inflation, but is more generous with the 401(k) catch-up contribution of $10,000: It would apply to people age 60 or older.  The House proposal also would change the tax aspect of catch-up amounts as a way to offset any revenue losses from other provisions.  At the end of the first quarter or beginning of second quarter, we could see action on the bills in both chambers.  That is, all catch-up contributions to 401(k) plans and the like would be treated as Roth contributions \u2014 i.e., after tax. Current law allows workers to choose whether to make those contributions on a pretax or Roth basis (assuming their company gives them the choice).  Additionally, matching contributions from employers currently can only be made to pretax accounts. A provision in the House would allow them to be post-tax (Roth) contributions if the employee wanted to go that route.  Student loan debt  Most companies that offer 401(k) plans will match your contributions up to a certain amount \u2014 e.g., a 100% match for the first 3% you contribute, with a 50% match for the next 2%. For workers whose student loan debt keeps them from putting money into their retirement accounts, it means missing out on that company money.  In both the House and Senate provisions, employers would be permitted to make contributions to 401(k) plans (and similar workplace plans) on behalf of employees who are making student loan payments instead of contributing to their retirement plan.  Auto-enrollment in 401(k) plans  A provision in the House would require employers to automatically enroll employees in their 401(k) plan at a rate of at least 3% and then increase it each year until the worker is contributing 10% of their pay. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees and new companies (under 3 years old) are among those that would be excluded from the mandate.  The Senate's version does not require auto-enrollment, although it includes incentives to encourage companies to implement that feature.  Annuities  One option to provide an income stream later in life is a qualified longevity annuity contract, or QLAC. Once you purchase the annuity, you specify when you want the income to start.  However, the maximum that can go into a QLAC is either $135,000 or 25% of the value of your retirement accounts, whichever is less.  In both the House and Senate, provisions would remove the 25% cap. The Senate would also increase the maximum amount allowed in a QLAC to $200,000.  Other stuff  Both the House and Senate propose creating a national online lost-and-found database for retirement accounts, which workers can lose track of after they leave a job.  Also, under provisions in both chambers, part-time employees who work at least 500 hours for two consecutive years would be eligible to participate in their company's 401(k) plan.",

Over the years that Californians debated the creation of a redistricting commission, Democrats \u2014 including Nancy Pelosi, now speaker of the House \u2014 opposed it as a Republican power grab that would give unelected bureaucrats control over voters. The state\u2019s Republicans \u2014 including Kevin McCarthy, now the House minority leader \u2014 argued that such a measure would make elected officials more accountable and empower Latino and Black voters.\n\nThe reason for the reversal comes down to one of McCarthy\u2019s fundamental rules of politics. Over lunch in 2006, when he was a state assemblyman representing bright-red Bakersfield, he explained it to me: Races are won before they\u2019re run.\n\nFor his party to gain more seats, it had to wrest the power to gerrymander away from the legislature\u2019s Democratic majority. His whole time in Sacramento, McCarthy pushed to establish an independent redistricting commission.\n\n\u201cRemoving the redistricting process from the hands of legislators would open up the process to greater public participation and input,\u201d McCarthy wrote in a 2005 Sacramento Bee opinion piece. \u201cNoncompetitive races often send unresponsive politicians to Sacramento. Fear of a challenging election is one of the surest ways to get the attention of a politician.\u201d\n\nAt the time, McCarthy\u2019s efforts failed. But Charles Munger Jr., Republican son of Warren Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, spent $13.5 million on redistricting commission initiatives from 2008 to 2010. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, another Republican, contributed $3 million from his campaign accounts. New York\u2019s Republican Mayor Mike Bloomberg and the California Chamber of Commerce gave six-figure donations, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nPelosi was one of 17 current and former Democratic members of the House from California who donated money to kill the 2010 initiative, which extended the redistricting commission\u2019s responsibility to drawing congressional lines. Labor unions, led by the American Federation of County, State and Municipal Employees\u2019s $1.7 million, also spent heavily to defeat the measures.\n\nThe Republicans prevailed, and the state established the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, to be made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and four voters with no party preference.\n\nBut if Republicans thought they were grabbing power, and Democrats feared losing it, both were wrong. In 2010, California Democrats held 34 seats to 19 for Republicans. Campaigning since then in districts that were redrawn in 2012, Democrats now hold 42 congressional seats to the Republicans\u2019 11.\n\nThe Republican losses came as their voter rolls shriveled \u2014 they now make up less than a quarter of the state\u2019s registered voters. But some districts remain in play. Moderate Republican David G. Valadao, from a heavily Democratic district, won back a seat in 2020 that he\u2019d lost in 2018, while Democrat Katie Porter held on to her seat in the former Republican bastion of Orange County. They know they must tend to voters if they\u2019re going to win those swing seats.\n\nTo make the cut, she had to write essays, pledge to be impartial and gather recommendation letters. The state auditor, an independent agency, winnowed the pool to 120, then legislators cut that in half. Ultimately, it came down to a lottery using ping-pong balls. Sadhwani\u2019s ball was drawn.\n\n\u201cGood governance and a strong democracy should not be a partisan issue,\u201d Sadhwani told me.\n\nRepublicans control more state legislatures than Democrats do, and so control redistricting in those states. Congressional Democrats recognize that one way to gain seats in gerrymandered red states is to establish independent commissions. Their fundraising appeals tout H.R. 1, promising to \u201cEND Republican gerrymandering.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy knows that gerrymandering protects incumbents, and leaving the ability to draw districts in legislators\u2019 hands will benefit Republicans in 2022 and beyond. So he denounces H.R. 1: \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to protect your vote. It\u2019s designed to put a thumb on the scale of every election in America and keep the swamp swampy.\u201d\n\nThe rule McCarthy spelled out over lunch in 2006 remains operative today. Understand that races are won before they\u2019re run, and it\u2019s clear why some politicians promote independent redistricting and others oppose it. Voters who want competition are left on the sidelines.",

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) pledged Tuesday that \u201cwe will try to work a path to get [statehood] done,\u201d and the White House asked Congress in a policy statement to pass the legislation as swiftly as possible.\n\nBut the political odds remain formidable, with the Senate filibuster requiring the support of 60 senators to advance legislation. Republicans, who hold 50 seats, have branded the bill as a Democratic power grab because it would create two Senate seats for the deep-blue city. Not even all Senate Democrats have backed the bill as the clock ticks toward the 2022 midterm election.\n\nStill, the unprecedented support from Democrats nationwide, including in the White House, has energized supporters.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a moment before us that has never existed for the statehood movement,\u201d said Josh Burch, co-founder of Neighbors United for DC Statehood. \u201cWe can pat ourselves on the back and celebrate the House vote, and we should. But really that needs to be short-lived, because we have a lot of work to make this a reality in the next year and a half.\u201d\n\nThe House passed the statehood bill for the first time last year, also without any Republican votes. Since then, sustained racial justice demonstrations and a broad focus on voting rights in the aftermath of the 2020 election have elevated the cause. Bringing their advocacy as far as Arizona and Alaska, groups such as 51 for 51 and Indivisible have described a city of second-class, plurality-Black citizens living in the nation\u2019s capital without any say in the nation\u2019s laws.\n\nNorton said this year\u2019s vote felt even more significant than last year\u2019s because awareness of the District\u2019s plight seems to be growing. \u201cIt\u2019s now begun to excite the country,\u201d she said in an interview earlier this week.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said lawmakers who voted for statehood \u201cmade the decision to believe in a stronger, more inclusive democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis vote comes at a critical time when Americans nationwide are eager to deliver on the promise of liberty and justice for all,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cFor centuries, an incremental approach to equality in America has delayed this promise for too many. Now is the time for bold action.\u201d\n\nH.R. 51 would shrink the federal district to a two-square-mile enclave, including federal buildings such as the Capitol and the White House. The rest of the residential and commercial areas would become the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, to honor abolitionist Frederick Douglass.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats\u2019 unity on the bill \u2014 only one member of the House caucus voted against it last year \u2014 completes an extraordinary evolution since the first statehood vote in 1993, when the majority of Democrats joined Republicans in voting no.\n\nDuring debate Thursday morning, Republicans and Democrats traded accusations of partisanship, given the unavoidable reality that District residents would be likely to vote for Democrats.\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.). \u201cHow somebody votes cannot be a test of whether they have the right to vote in a democracy.\u201d\n\nRep. James Comer (R-Ky.) said D.C. statehood was \u201cnot really about voting representation\u201d but was in fact \u201cabout Democrats consolidating their power in Washington.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nHe and many others maintained that D.C. statehood would be unconstitutional, since the creation of a federal district and Congress\u2019s authority over it is enshrined in the Constitution. (Democrats counter that argument by pointing out that H.R. 51 maintains Congress\u2019s power over the shrunken federal district.)\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t see taxation without representation,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said about his GOP colleagues. \u201cThey don\u2019t see military service without representation, when tens of thousands of people have served the nation in every war going back to the Revolutionary War. All that they see is two new liberal Democrat senators.\u201d\n\nRepublicans urged Rep. Mondaire Jones (D.-N.Y.) to withdraw his remarks after he called arguments against D.C. statehood \u201cracist trash\u201d on April 21. (The Washington Post)\n\nAt one point, Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) accused Republicans of racism in their opposition to statehood, recalling comments by GOP lawmakers that D.C. was not well-rounded or working-class enough to be a state, and lacked a landfill. On Thursday, Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said the city does not have manufacturing, agriculture or natural resources.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have had enough of my colleagues\u2019 racist insinuations that somehow the people of Washington, D.C., are incapable or even unworthy of our democracy,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOne of my House Republican colleagues said that D.C. couldn\u2019t be a state because the district doesn\u2019t have a landfill. My goodness, with all the racist trash my colleagues have brought to the debate, I can see whey they\u2019re worried about having a place to put it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans erupted, asking that Jones\u2019s words be taken down. Jones agreed to withdraw them.\n\nAdvocates and city leaders have largely focused on D.C. statehood as a racial justice and civil rights issue \u2014 \u201cprobably the most urgent voting rights issue of our time,\u201d as 51 for 51 Director Stasha Rhodes put it.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nMany proponents have drawn direct parallels between state Republicans\u2019 efforts to enact more stringent laws restricting voting and federal Republicans\u2019 opposition to statehood. Both result in fewer people having access to the franchise \u2014 in D.C., more than 712,000, according to Census Bureau estimates, 46 percent of whom are Black.\n\nAdvocates often point out that the District \u2014 once nicknamed \u201cChocolate City\u201d for its thriving Black culture and majority population \u2014 would have the largest proportion of African Americans of any state.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of lip service around how we\u2019re going to move the needle on racial justice in our country,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThe real way to move the needle is on structural democracy reform. There is no better step to start with than D.C. statehood.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\n\n\nBowser made racial justice a primary focus of her testimony in support of H.R. 51 before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last month. Beverly Perry, her senior adviser, said in an interview that educating senators across the political spectrum about the role racism historically played in D.C.\u2019s disenfranchisement has become a central part of the strategy to gain their support.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the history of why this situation exists the way it does, it is grounded in racism. There\u2019s nothing you can do but correct it,\u201d Perry said. \u201cAt some point .\u2009.\u2009. we have to stop being partisan when it comes to racial issues.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators from less populous states have worried that D.C. statehood would \u201cdilute\u201d their states\u2019 power, as Sen. Steve Daines (Mont.) put it this week. Some Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), have said they would prefer having D.C. retroceded to Maryland, which Maryland has not yet supported.\n\nSen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), sponsor of the Senate bill, said he will nevertheless ask Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to schedule a hearing on the legislation as soon as this spring.\n\nCarper said he is lobbying the Democratic caucus to support the bill, with only Manchin and Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, both of Arizona, outstanding.\n\nWith Democrats in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, activists say they are in their strongest position yet to make D.C. the 51st state. (Drea Cornejo, Amber Ferguson, Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nSinema\u2019s seat on Peters\u2019s evenly divided committee makes her a possible linchpin vote. When asked for the senator\u2019s position on statehood, a spokeswoman said Sinema \u201cdoes not preview votes.\u201d\n\nCarper has been seeking advice from a longtime friend, former senator Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), a Democrat turned independent who introduced the first Senate statehood bill in 2012, albeit two weeks before he retired. Carper said he would ask Lieberman to come testify.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter Wednesday whether Lieberman could help change Republican minds, Graham, a longtime friend of Lieberman\u2019s, said, \u201cZero chance.\u201d\n\nNorton said she remains hopeful that the Senate will find a way to seize on its thin majority, and President Biden\u2019s support, to pass statehood. But she acknowledged that it could take years.\n\n\u201cBills as extraordinary as this bill usually take more than a session or two to pass,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019re not at all discouraged.\u201d\n\nBurch, the longtime statehood advocate, knows the feeling.\n\nAsked how he would celebrate the House vote on Thursday, he said, \u201cBy emailing and pestering a bunch of Senate offices.\u201d",

She said he laughed at her in front of the patient and left after she said she was not planning to get the shot.\nBothered by the reaction, Carpenter explained she sent him an email to tell him his reaction was inappropriate but did not hear back. Carpenter said she followed up with an email to the human resources department.\n\"And H.R. basically told me that because I stated that I wasn\u2019t going to be getting the vaccine that my boss did not owe it to me to write me back in an email and I shortly after that went to log back into my email for a class that I had signed up for under the hospital, and my account had been deactivated and when I called H.R., they basically told me that I am voluntarily resigning and I explained to them that that wasn\u2019t the case at all, they were firing me for not getting the vaccine,\" she told host Ainsley Earhardt, adding she did not receive a letter of recommendation after five years at the hospital.\u00a0\nBIDEN DENIES HE'S 'OLD FRIENDS' WITH CHINA'S XI, SAYS WORLD QUESTIONING BEIJING ON COVID-19 ORIGIN PROBE\nNurses nationwide could face termination as vaccine mandates take effect in hospitals.

    "body": "Washington (CNN) The House passed gun legislation that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, marking the first congressional move on significant gun control since Democrats won the White House and the majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe House passed the legislation in two separate votes.\n\nThe first vote on H.R. 8 , the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, passed 227-203 and would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers.\n\nAnd eight Republicans supported the legislation and one Democrat voting against it.\n\nThe eight Republicans were Vern Buchanan of Florida, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Maria Salazar of Florida, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Chris Smith of New Jersey, Fred Upton of Michigan, Carlos Gimenez of Florida and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.\n\nAnd the lone Democrat was Rep. Jared Golden, who also voted against the Covid-19 package.\n\nTwo Republicans voted for it in 2019 but did not support it this time around \u2014 Reps. Brian Mast and Mario Diaz-Balart.\n\nTwo Democrats opposed the legislation \u2014 Reps. Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Golden.\n\nAnd the Republicans who voted for this legislation were Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Chris Smith of New Jersey.\n\n\"These people who were practicing their faith, their faith that taught them to welcome in a stranger, a stranger came to their door and they welcomed into their Bible study, he sat with them for an hour,\" Clyburn said on the House floor Wednesday. \"The stranger that they had welcomed in had opened fire and killed nine of them, one of who was the pastor, a former intern of mine.\"\n\n\"This law would have prevented that gentleman from getting a gun,\" Clyburn added.\n\nThe bills are expected to pass the House but will face a steep uphill climb in the Senate as Democrats hold a slim 50-50 majority and would need significant Republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster. Still, the legislation remains a priority for the Biden administration.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer committed to putting the Bipartisan Background Checks Act on the Senate floor for a vote and suggested having discussions after on how to work with Republicans.\n\n\"We'll have the good sense to have had this bill twice and in the past when they send it over to us last time, it went into Mitch McConnell's legislative graveyard. The legislative graveyard is over. H.R. 8 will be on the floor of the Senate and we will see where everybody stands,\" Schumer said. \"No more thoughts and prayers. A vote is what we need. A vote.\"\n\nWhen asked what will need to happen for Senate Democrats to get to 60 votes on the legislation, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said there have been \"ongoing conversations\" to get Republicans to sign on.\n\n\"There have been ongoing conversations off and on all the way through. And, you know, I think Sen. Schumer was clear that the initial vote would be on H.R. 8, and then we would talk about what might be advisable and necessary to pass it,\" he told reporters.\n\nAnd Sen. Chris Murphy, also a Connecticut Democrat, expressed hope some sort of gun control legislation could pass in the Senate.\n\n\"I just think we're living in such a different world than 2013. So much has changed. The politics around us are fundamentally different....I just think that you can't compare 2013 to 2021. I think there are a lot of Republican senators that are thinking about voting for a proposal allows them to get right on this issue,\" Murphy said, who represents Connecticut where the Sandy Hook shooting took place.\n\nHe added: \"And we will see where people stand. And maybe we'll get the votes and if we don't we'll come together and figure out how we're going to get this done because we have to get it done.\"\n\nThe White House has also said gun control legislation is a \"priority\" for President Joe Biden.\n\nBrian Lemek -- the executive director of Brady PAC, the sister organization of gun violence prevention group the Brady Campaign -- praised the House members who supported the legislation.\n\n\"Members of the House of Representatives made it clear today, with bipartisan support, where they stand on preventing a countless number of deaths from happening again in the future. Between now and 2022, Brady PAC will make sure every voter knows and doesn't forget who did and did not vote for this lifesaving piece of legislation that 90% of Americans support,\" he said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.",

Pufenstuf, to today\u2019s social media \u2013 Sid Krofft has some stories to tell. And trust me, he\u2019s ready to share. \n \n\u201cI'm so grateful this all happened,\u201d Krofft said in a recent Zoom interview from his Laurel Canyon home in Los Angeles. \u201cI'm getting to share. I'm reliving my life. You mention any star and I have a story. People love listening to what happened. I guess you can hear my enthusiasm, for a 92-year-old.\u201d\n \n \nThese days, Krofft shows are even getting name-checked in Ted Lasso, which just won the Emmy for best comedy. In one Season 2 episode, the titular character plays with the shorthand term for Human Resources, referring to H.R. Pufenstuf, a joke he then notes only people born within a small window of time 50 years ago might get (I, um, got it, and so did a delighted Krofft). \n \n \nIn managing his Instagram show, Krofft depends heavily on his long-time assistant, Kelly Killian, who encouraged him to venture online in the first place after the pandemic cut him off from his usual out-and-about routine. \n \n \n\u201cThe stories I've heard, a lot of them I can't repeat,\u201d Killian said. \u201cI was just sitting at his feet every night in the kitchen (thinking), \u2018You can't deny the world these stories.\u2019\u00a0I'm in my early 40s. I\u2019m never going to sit with Judy Garland or Edith Piaf or Liberace. I'm never going to get those things, but I can get a sense of it listening to him. There\u2019s something really magical about all this stuff sitting inside this person.\u201d\n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n   Sid Krofft on set with one of his 1970s children's shows\n \n   \n  (Image courtesy of Sid Krofft) \n  \n \nThe Krofft brothers\u2019 credit list also includes some not-kids-only shows, like specials for Raquel Welch and Patti LaBelle, movies such as Sideshow and Middle Age Crazy, and variety shows The Donnie and Marie Show with the Osmond siblings, Pink Lady with the Japanese pop duo, and Barbara Mandrell and Her Sisters with the country singer, among many other unexpected entries. \n \nFlash forward 50 years and Krofft\u2019s latest show features a lot of unlikely names in an even more unlikely online venue than the many he\u2019s been part of around the world over the decades.\n \nInitially, the fans who found Krofft were often themselves puppeteers from around the world influenced by the work he did over decades in preserving puppetry as a popular medium. \n \nMore recently, the range of celebrities who\u2019s shown up is considerably more wide-ranging, including the gifted Black artist Kara Walker, who uses puppets in some of her controversy-stirring work, magician David Copperfield, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race star BenDeLaCreme, Off Broadway drag star Dixie Longate, choreographer/producer Debbie Allen (fresh off her own lifetime achievement Emmy), actress Beverly D\u2019Angelo, and more.\n \n \n  \n  \n   \n   Liberace with Sid Krofft, whose puppetry act opened for the flamboyant pianist's national tour. \n \n   \n  (Image courtesy of Sid Krofft) \n  \n \nAmong those most tickled by Krofft\u2019s emergence online is long-time friend Paul Reubens. He\u2019s better known as the person behind Pee-Wee\u2019s Playhouse, the brain-melting 1980s kids show and movie spinoffs that is the most obvious creative heir to Krofft kids shows from 20 years earlier, including Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, Lidsville, and The Bugaloos, as well as H.R. Pufenstuf and Land of the Lost. \n \nReubens, himself impossibly 79, has known Krofft and Krofft\u2019s business-minded younger brother Marty since the second season of Playhouse in 1987, when the brothers stopped by the set of his Emmy-winning children\u2019s show. Seeing his pal take so readily to Instagram Live more recently actually made a sort of sense, Reubens said. \n \n\u201cIt just doesn't surprise me it's a year later\u201d and he\u2019s still doing it, Reubens said. \u201cI didn't for a second think, \u2018Why would he do this?\u2019\u00a0 I knew him well enough a\u00a0year and a half ago to know that he had a lot of this stuff and he's hard to shut up. I thought, \u2018Oh, interesting, good idea.\u2019 It's been this unbelievable fantastic experience for him. Basically, he's been recharged and restored. This has just been a huge thing for him. He's just absolutely in love with everything wrapped around this. He says he reads every comment, and he's not kidding. He's on Instagram all the time.\u201d\n \nReubens is an online star as well, his 1.4 million followers on Facebook alone dwarfing Krofft\u2019s modest 16,400 followers on Instagram. Among the multiplying projects Reubens is working on (an NFT drop, a virtual world, a memoir, a biographical documentary, a photography book about the items he has collected/hoarded) is a planned live club act with Krofft, whenever they can get into clubs again, Reubens said. \n \n\u201cI'm the busiest I have been in my entire life,\u201d Reubens said. \u201cI\u2019m so wrapped up in me, capital ME, that I don't really like it that much. It\u2019s much more fun to be involved in a group.\u201d\u00a0\n \nBut hanging with Sid (still done mostly virtually because of their respective ages and COVID) remains one of Reubens\u2019 great pleasures, he said. \n \n\u201cOur friendship has developed and grown and aged like a fine wine, like the whiners we both are,\u201d Reubens said. \u201cWe whine to each other a lot. We joke and are very funny. Sid to me has one of the greatest first lines of a story that goes nowhere that I have ever heard: \u2018I once walked into a room and saw Liberace and James Dean on the floor. They were gold-leafing crystals from a chandelier.\u2019 It sounds so juicy and your expectations are\u00a0so high, then it doesn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\n \nKrofft has other projects underway, including a hush-hush initiative with Copperfield and Allen that Reubens says he was aced out of. \n \nIn the meantime, Sundays with Sid hits its 75th episode on Instagram Live at 3 pm PST on Sunday, Oct. 3. The lineup will be super-sized, with six guests, including Reubens, D\u2019Angelo, Copperfield, Allen, Donnie Osmond, and TV comedy writer Bruce Vilanch.",

    "body": "The volume of such laws is jaw-dropping. \u201cMore than 230 bills have been put forward in thirty-eight state legislatures seeking to restrict voting access,\u201d Abrams noted. That is already \u201cfour times the number of bills to restrict voting access as generally compared to the first week of February 2020 \u2014 an election year.\u201d\n\nDespite 2020\u2032s record turnout \u2014 or because of it \u2014 and despite the absence of any evidence of significant fraud,  Republicans have turned to a series of voter suppression measures. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that they want to make it harder to vote only because they believe this will keep them in power. The measures include tactics such as shortening polling place hours; eliminating no-excuse absentee voting; reducing the number of polling places (thereby increasing wait times that are already too long, especially in minority communities); limiting early voting; and making voter ID requirements harder to meet. These measures might not \u201cwork\u201d \u2014 that is, voters will figure out how to overcome barriers. But the presence of such tactics is a blight on our nation. Denying the right to vote to anyone by these stratagems poses a threat to our democracy at a moment when one party has undermined the sanctity of elections and its supporters have resorted to violence.\n\nIn the 23 states where Republicans control both state legislative bodies and the governorships (including competitive states of Georgia, Arizona, Florida, Texas and Ohio), there are only three ways to stop the mass disenfranchisement of voters.\n\nFirst, there is litigation, using evidence of the total absence of significant fraud to make the case that these are thinly disguised efforts to prevent certain protected groups from voting. Such lawsuits will certainly ensue, but there is no guarantee they will succeed.\n\nSecond, popular outrage and peaceful protests, as in the civil rights era, might apply some pressure to state governments. However, unless and until Republicans committed to voter suppression are kicked out of office (or fear they will be), they are unlikely to relent.\n\nThird, federal legislation to nationalize basic voting protections, as set forth in H.R. 1, could supersede state laws. But as in the Jim Crow era, the presence of the Senate filibuster stands in the way of securing basic voting rights at the federal level.\n\nOne tactic to break the filibuster might be to find 10 Republicans to support a slimmed-down version of H.R. 1 that includes a handful of reforms, such as reinstitution of the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act; a guaranteed period of early voting or mail-in voting; and requirements for paper-ballot backups that can be audited after the election. Even then, it is doubtful 10 senators can be found in a party still in the thrall of the disgraced former president who spread the Big Lie about a stolen election. (The job might be easier if Democrats flip a few states in 2022.)\n\nAnother tactic might be to insist the Republicans actually go through with 24/7 filibustering (not simply concede if Democrats fail to get 60 votes for cloture) \u2014 as the Southern segregationists did. The spectacle of MAGA-complicit Republicans blocking voting rights might stir public pressure. Perhaps after days or weeks of Republicans inveighing against voting rights, Democratic senators who heretofore have said they would not do away with the filibuster might change their minds.\n\nWe have a situation virtually identical to one we faced in the 1960s. One side (now the Republicans instead of Southern Democrats) has figured out how to defeat the fundamental tenet of democracy \u2014 access to the ballot \u2014 by defending rules designed to block people, disproportionately nonwhites, from voting. At the state level, Republicans insulate themselves from accountability with these same barriers. At the federal level, an anti-democratic minority in the Senate makes a mockery of the right to vote.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the problem (and the willingness of Republicans to embrace the insurrectionist in chief who sought to overturn an election), we arrive at an all-hands-on-deck moment for democracy. That should entail every conceivable nonviolent measure \u2014 mass peaceful protests, elections (to throw out Republicans and primary Democrats who refuse to break the Senate filibuster), state referendums (where available) and litigation. Everyone \u2014 not just Abrams or House Democrats \u2014 must be dedicated to expanding, not shrinking, voting access. Otherwise, Jan. 6 will be the first step in the undoing of American democracy.",

But despite the constant stalemates, some Republicans have offered alternative plans, meaning that the possibility of some form of bipartisan gun legislation may still exist.\n Pennsylvania Republican Sen.

But, you know, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d\n   Toomey and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin cosponsored a bipartisan background checks bill in 2013, the closest Congress has come to passing any broad gun legislation since the 1990s. The bill got 54 votes in Senate, but ultimately fell six votes short of breaking a filibuster. (RELATED: Democrats Vow To Act On Gun Control, But Major Action Is Unlikely)\n Sen. Pat Toomey and Sen.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an executive order signing ceremony on lowering drug ... [+] prices in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, July 24, 2020. Trump announced new policies aimed at lowering prescription drug prices under Medicare by linking them to rates paid in other countries and allowing Americans to buy prescription medication imported from Canada. Photographer: Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg\n \n   \n  \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg Finance LP \n  \n \nOn December 23rd, the United States District Court in Maryland issued a temporary \u2013 14 day - nationwide injunction for the Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing model for Medicare Part B drugs that was due to go into effect on January 1, 2021. The injunction prevents the Trump Administration from implementing the rule for two weeks. During this period of time the Court will assess the legality of the model.\n \nIn September, President Trump issued the MFN executive order aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs in the Medicare program. The executive order would tie what Medicare pays for physician-administered drugs to the lowest, volume-adjusted prices paid among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations with a commensurate Gross Domestic Product. The order would apply to 50 of the highest cost drugs under Medicare\u2019s Part B program. Pursuant to the executive order, on November 27, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formally published its \u201cMost Favored Nation Rule\u201d in the Federal Register.\n \nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Association of Community Cancer Centers, the Global Colon Cancer Association, and the National Infusion Center Association had filed a complaint requesting a court injunction. The motion and accompanying memorandum assert that the MFN rule will \u201ccause immediate and irreparable harm to Medicare patients, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.\u201d In particular, the plaintiffs argue that patients will suffer from impeded access, because some healthcare providers may \u201cchoose not to provide MFN model drugs or prescribe alternative therapies instead.\u201d The motion goes on to state that this \u201charm is not mere speculation.\u201d In fact, according to the memorandum, even CMS acknowledges that the MFN Rule could impede patients\u2019 ability to access certain medications.\n \n \nThe complaint\u2019s allegations focus on three key areas:\n \n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Trump Administration exceeded the authority granted to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) under the Affordable Care Act to conduct demonstration projects. The mandatory - as opposed to voluntary - character of the MFN demonstration project is not in keeping with CMMI\u2019s authority.\n \n \n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Trump Administration violated the U.S. Constitution by using a regulatory process to rewrite the Medicare statute and restructure the reimbursement system for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs. This is Congress\u2019 remit, not the executive branch.\n \n \n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Trump Administration failed to demonstrate the so-called \u201cgood cause\u201d required for the interim final rule to bypass notice and comment procedures that allow the public to evaluate and weigh in on proposed regulations. Regarding the latter item, the MFN model\u2019s interim final rule was finalized using an extraordinarily abbreviated regulatory process, which the U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Blake specifically criticized. She wrote that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had failed to follow required procedures for notice and comment before enacting such sweeping changes.\n \nMoreover, Judge Blake argued the executive order would set a precedent for being the first time a \u201cprice control mechanism was implemented that was not provided for by Congress.\u201d\n \nBesides, it would be unprecedented to establish a price control mechanism for goods sold in the U.S. market based on prices set in foreign jurisdictions.\n \nHow this temporary restraining order will play out is highly uncertain, not only from a legal standpoint but also in light of the imminent change in Administration at the White House. Next week the Court is due to provide its assessment of the demonstration project\u2019s legality. Supposing the Court deems the model unlawful, this won\u2019t necessarily nix a future MFN-like policy for Medicare Part B drugs. \n \nInterestingly, the incoming Biden Administration and outgoing Trump Administration have some shared commonality in terms of their views on prescription drug prices. The Biden transition team, for example, has advocated for better alignment of prices of prescription drugs in the U.S. and international markets.\n \nIt\u2019s quite conceivable the Biden Administration would wish to implement some kind of partial realignment of Medicare drug prices based on an international pricing index. This wouldn\u2019t happen, however, by way of an executive order, but rather through Congress. Notably, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act H.R. 3 would utilize a similarly constructed price control mechanism for drugs covered under both Medicare Parts B (physician-administered) and D (outpatient). In fact, H.R. 3\u2019s methodology to deploy an international pricing index is strikingly similar to the pricing provisions contained in Trump\u2019s executive order.\n \nWithout a majority in the Senate, however, this will prove to be very difficult. The Senate run-off elections in Georgia on Tuesday, January 5th could therefore determine the fate of any potential bill that includes international reference pricing.",

Little by little, Giang's childhood optimism crumbled, giving way to loneliness and grief.  \u2018Be courageous and don't ever give up on hope'  In powerful detail, Giang's letter recounts mounting panic attacks, ostracism by classmates, a growing sense of dread.  As Giang's mental health deteriorated, teachers looked on in alarm. But without training, school staff were ill equipped to offer any meaningful assistance.  Eventually, Giang recalls, a kind friend listened nonjudgementally, opening the door to a way out of despair. \"You realized you were not alone at all,\" Giang writes.  \u2018You realized you were not alone at all'  Today, Giang, who uses they/them pronouns, is a UNICEF Youth Advocate whose personal struggle informs their commitment to creating a more equitable and inclusive future, where children and adolescents facing mental health challenges will have easy access to the services they need.  Teachers, Giang says, can be invaluable first responders when they are trained to support young people and connect them with the right resources.  \"I want to see schools where mental health issues are looked at just as any other physical challenges,\" says Giang. \"And there will no longer be barriers, stigma or discrimination to stop us.\"  \u00a9 UNICEF  Protecting the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents is a key part of UNICEF's mission.

The situation had Hallie tossing a gun belonging to Hunter into a trashcan behind a grocery store, only to have the firearm later disappear.\n\nAccording to the outlet, following the incident, Secret Service \u201capproached the owner of the store where Hunter bought the gun and asked to take the paperwork involving the sale, according to two people, one of whom has firsthand knowledge of the episode and the other was briefed by a Secret Service agent after the fact\u201d:\n\nThe gun store owner refused to supply the paperwork, suspecting that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter\u2019s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime, the two people said. The owner, Ron Palmieri, later turned over the papers to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, which oversees federal gun laws. The Secret Service says it has no record of its agents investigating the incident, and Joe Biden, who was not under protection at the time, said through a spokesperson he has no knowledge of any Secret Service involvement. Days later, the gun was returned by an older man who regularly rummages through the grocery\u2019s store\u2019s trash to collect recyclable items, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nPolitico managed to obtain a copy of the Firearms Transaction Record and a receipt for the gun in question, dated Oct. 12, 2018. It asked, \u201cAre you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\u201d Hunter answered \u201cno\u201d despite his history of drug use \u2014 something that ultimately had him discharged from the Navy Reserve:\n\nEven worse: The gun he purchased was then thrown into a dumpster behind a grocery store across the street from a high school where it was later recovered by an old man rummaging through the trash. https://t.co/DFAHoZu4Md \u201cLying on the form is a felony, though prosecutions for it are\u00a0exceedingly rare,\u201d Politico reported, adding that neither Hallie Biden nor Hunter\u2019s lawyer provided a comment on the matter. The news comes as Democrats begin to vehemently pursue gun control measures, with President Biden pushing Congress to act on H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 and calling for an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban in the wake of Monday\u2019s shooting attack at a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store.",

MCMASTER: Sadly, I think he has a little bit longer to go. And, you know, of course, he's running out of options, right? He thought this was going to be easy. He thought he could do it in a few days. He thought the Ukrainian people would welcome him. He believed his own propaganda and disinformation, which you just covered so well. And so, what's he left with? He's left with more devastation. And this follows kind of the playbook of the Russians. I mean, they've enabled serial episodes of mass homicide in the Syrian Civil War. And if you think back to Chechnya, the Chechnya interventions in the 1990s, Putin presided over the last one in 1999 where they essentially dealt with Chechnya rebels in Grozny by just leveling the city. So, I mean, there's tough times ahead for the Ukrainian people. They deserve all the support we can give them. But I don't think, you know, I don't think Russia could be able to accomplish its objectives, but he can certainly inflict a heck of a lot more pain and suffering and make what is already a humanitarian crisis much worse.\nWATCH THE FULL SEGMENT BELOW:",

The background check measure received the most support from Republicans in the House.\n\nThe other measure would extend the time federal investigators have to perform background checks from three days to 10 days. Two House Republicans voted for it.\n\nEach bill would need 60 votes to make it through the Senate, meaning 10 Republicans would have to cross the aisle to overcome a legislative filibuster.\n\nSome Senate Democrats say they\u2019re already holding conversations with Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to senators across the aisle, but the real difference-makers in this debate are the survivors, students, and family members who have made this issue a movement,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told The Hill about his plan for getting Republican support.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful advocates for change are the people who have personal stories to share about how a background check could have saved someone they love -- that\u2019s who my Republican colleagues have to answer to,\u201d he added.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s weakened state is also adding optimism to gun control advocates.\n\nThe once powerful pro-gun lobbying group filed for bankruptcy and announced in January that it will reincorporate in Texas and leave New York.

I witnessed mothers crying because they couldn\u2019t afford their children\u2019s medicine. (RELATED: WILLIAMSON: America Needs To Get Serious About Solving The Opioid Epidemic Before It\u2019s Too Late)\n No parent, no person, should ever be forced to make that decision. On that point, my Democrat colleagues and I seem to agree. But good intentions do not always breed good policy, and Washington Democrats have wrongfully concluded that the thing that will fix our healthcare industry \u2014 the free market \u2014 is what broke it.\n Speaker Pelosi\u2019s partisan Fewer Cures Act\u00a0puts politics above patients by calling for less innovation and fewer cures. It also robs hope from patients with Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, cancer, ALS and other diseases with no known cure, who are desperately waiting for innovative medical breakthroughs.\n When fewer cures hit the market, fewer lives are saved. That\u2019s what Khrystal, whose son Hunter was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, is afraid of. She warns that \u201cresearch would stall under the price controls tied to reference pricing under H.R. 3\u201d and would lead to an \u201cinnovation desert.\u201d\n  Hunter deserves better. Khrystal deserves better. The American people deserve better.\n Operation Warp Speed, which under former President Donald Trump delivered three lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines in record time, reaffirmed that our health care system thrives when the government subsides. In lockstep with that ideology, Republican leaders introduced H.R. 19, the Lower Costs More Cures Act, which will encourage innovation, make insulin more affordable, decrease our reliance on China, reduce the cost of cancer treatments and increase price transparency.\n As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I had the privilege of cosponsoring this legislation.\n This completely bipartisan bill will put the power back where it belongs \u2014 with patients and with the free market. We must bring this bill up for a vote and send it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk.\n \n While this bill is an important first step towards modernizing our health care system, there is another, hidden actor that is artificially driving up prescription drug costs: pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).\n Picture this: you purchase a printer for $100 with a $20 rebate. That $20 is mailed back to you, the customer, bringing the cost of your printer down to $80. In most industries, that\u2019s how rebates work.\n In prescription medicine there are rebates, too; but, instead of the purchaser, or patient, getting money back, that money is taken by the PBMs and given back to the insurance companies, which the PBM often owns. PBMs take money from one hand, give it to the other, and patients are stuck with exorbitantly high drug costs.\n PBMs have become billion-dollar, Fortune 25 companies by forcing patients to pay double (or more) what their drug costs to manufacture.\n That is highway robbery and it needs to stop. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission voted to investigate PBMs for their harmful practices, and I hope for the sake of patient access that they are finally reined in.\n You wouldn\u2019t shop at a grocery store if you couldn\u2019t see the cost of your food. You wouldn\u2019t fill up your tank without knowing the price of gas. Patients shouldn\u2019t be expected to blindly pay prescription drug prices, either.\n PBMs block patients\u2019 access to drugs. Democrats are blocking the Lower Costs, More Cures Act from coming up for a vote.

    "body": "The Republican Study Committee (RSC) is publishing a new memo on Thursday that will expose several immigration proposals from their Democrat counterparts that the conservative bloc of House members says will make the burgeoning crisis at the U.S. border with Mexico even \u201cworse\u201d than President Joe Biden already has.\n\nThe one-page memo, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release, details how Biden has unleashed a crisis on the border\u2014and then how various Democrat proposals will make it worse. The memo is designed to arm up Republican lawmakers with talking points and information so they can fight the various immigration proposals from the Dream Act amnesty to the farm amnesty and more that Democrats are attempting to ram through Congress in the coming days and weeks. The RSC\u2019s chairman, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), has made fighting illegal immigration and Biden\u2019s and Democrats\u2019 amnesty pushes a central part of the RSC\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cDHS recently announced that officials should no longer use the terms \u2018alien\u2019 or \u2018illegal\u2019 to describe illegal aliens,\u201d the memo opens. \u201cThere are now only \u2018undocumented noncitizens,\u2019 so illegal immigration can\u2019t be a problem\u2014that\u2019s how their fantasy goes. The problem with acting as if illegal immigration is good, is that eventually you collide, headfirst, with reality: illegal immigration causes suffering. The Biden admin can \u2018imagine there\u2019s no borders,\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that 73% of voters are concerned about the border crisis. Until Democrats are forced to confront political reality in 2022, they seem determined to ignore the humanitarian crisis and widespread suffering they created and sip margaritas in their alternate reality. RSC previously outlined how the crisis on our border can be 100% traced back to Joe Biden\u2019s immigration executive orders.That is no longer the case. Joe Biden had to deploy FEMA to our border last week and House Democrats responded by introducing TWO am- nesty bills. As AP\u2019s Julie Pace explained, the Biden administration claims that illegal immigrants don\u2019t have an \u2018open invitation\u2019 to come to the U.S., but, \u2018that\u2019s not the message that\u2019s actually being received,\u2019 at our border.\u201d\n\nThe memo argues that Biden\u2019s actions, despite rhetoric saying the border is not open, indicate a willingness to accept migrants in droves despite them not coming to the United States legally. What\u2019s more, Biden and his Democrat allies on Capitol Hill offering up multiple amnesties legislatively sends an even worse message to those who seek to illegally enter the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of message does TWO amnesty bills send?\u201d the memo continues. \u201cWhen H.R. 6 hits the House floor, illegal immigration will rise even more, and the Border Crisis and Democrats\u2019 amnesty push will become undistinguishable. Because: Biden\u2019s Border Crisis IS AN AMNESTY CRISIS. Democrats haven\u2019t just refused to reverse the policies that caused the border crisis\u2014they are introducing new policies that are meant to make the Border Crisis worse. RSC\u2019s job is to shake Democrats awake and convince them they have no choice but to end the Border Crisis. So, please, use the below fact sheet to explain to your constituents just how disastrous Biden\u2019s amnesty bills will be.\u201d\n\nThe memo then breaks out several specific pieces of what it calls \u201cBiden\u2019s immigration legislation.\u201d The first, H.R. 6 or the \u201cAmerican Dream and Promise Act,\u201d is an amnesty for millions of so-called \u201cdreamers.\u201d\n\n\u201cH.R. 6 would provide amnesty for so-called Dreamers, to recipients or potential recipients of Temporary Pro- tected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), and children of certain nonimmigrant visa holders,\u201d the memo says about this bill. \u201cA total of roughly 2 million illegal immigrants would receive amnesty.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat Dream Act would, according to the memo, \u201cincrease budget deficits by $26.3 billion over the 2020-2029 by allowing formerly illegal immigrants to receive federal assistance\u201d and \u201callow the Secretary to waive inadmissibility grounds on health-related grounds (such as having a communicable disease of public health significance)\u201d as well as \u201cestablish a difficult standard for denying green cards to criminal gang members, so much so that the individual Secretary of DHS himself or herself would have to issue denials.\u201d\n\nThe second Biden and Democrat amnesty plan that the RSC memo exposes is H.R. 1603, the \u201cFarm Workforce Modernization Act.\u201d This bill, according to the RSC memo, would \u201cgrant amnesty to over 1 million unlawful illegal alien agricultural workers and their dependents.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgricultural worker is defined as someone who\u2019s worked 180 days over 2 years in agriculture,\u201d the RSC memo says of the bill. \u201cThat\u2019s equivalent to a 5.6-hour workday.\u201d\n\nEven criminal illegal aliens convicted of two misdemeanors, like two DUIs, would be eligible for amnesty under the farm amnesty plan according to the RSC memo.\n\nThe third Biden amnesty bill exposed in the RSC memo is the much broader amnesty for every illegal alien in America. That bill, the \u201cU.S. Citizenship Act of 2021,\u201d would according to the RSC \u201cimmediately\u201d grant amnesty to all of the approximately 22 million illegal aliens in America. They would \u201cbecome \u2018Lawful Prospective Immigrants\u2019 and be eligible for work authorization and SSNIs\u201d right off the bat and then \u201cafter 5 years they\u2019d receive a green card.\u201d\n\nThe broader amnesty plan also includes a fast-track for some illegal aliens in specialized groups.\n\n\u201cSo-called Dreamers, TPS holders, and immigrant farmworkers who performed 400 workdays of agricultural labor over the past 5 years, as well as their spouses and children, would be eligible to receive green cards immediately under the legislation, then citizenship after 3 years,\u201d the RSC memo says.\n\nIt also allows previously deported illegal aliens a chance to come back and get amnesty.\n\n\u201cIllegal aliens that were deported during the Trump administration that lived in the U.S. for three years prior to their deportation could return to the United States,\u201d the RSC memo says of the broader Biden amnesty plan, adding that it also \u201creduces immigration restrictions on criminals by shrinking the types of adjudications that would constitute a \u2018conviction\u2019 under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d\n\nThe bill also \u201celiminates per-country employment visa caps,\u201d and \u201cover the next 10 years, Biden\u2019s immigration bill would double our legal immigration levels and lead to an extra 37 million immigrants moving to the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more than the entire population of California,\u201d the memo concludes.",

    "body": "PHOENIX \u2013\u00a0The U.S. House passed a sweeping drought and wildfire relief package Friday that authorizes funding for drought-relief efforts on the Colorado River, strengthens wildfire recovery efforts and upholds tribal water rights along the Arizona-California border.\n\nThe measures, sponsored by Reps. Greg Stanton and Ra\u00fal Grijalva, both Arizona Democrats,\u00a0are part of a larger package of\u00a049 bills that seek to prepare the U.S. for an increase in droughts and wildfires, called the Wildfire Response and Drought Resilience Act.\n\nThe package passed with 218-199, mostly along party lines.\n\nThe money isn\u2019t guaranteed. The package\u00a0still needs to pass the\u00a0Senate, which has blocked Democratic-backed House bills often this session. If it passes both the House and the Senate, the package will go to the White House for the president's signature.\n\nOne bill in the package, H.R. 8435, or the Colorado River Drought Response Act, would give the Department of the Interior $500 million in discretionary funds to relieve pressure on the Colorado River system and prevent Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which are at historically low levels, from declining to critically low levels.\n\nThe Colorado River, which is particularly sensitive to climate change, has seen declining water levels for years and last August the federal government took the unprecedented step of declaring a shortage on the river, triggering water cutbacks to some farmers in the region.\n\nUnder the bill passed Friday, states and other entities\u00a0could apply for grants for a range of things, including compensating users who\u00a0volunteer to cut back their water use, drilling wells, lining\u00a0canals to prevent water from seeping into the ground and increasing efficiency for hydropower production.\n\nThe bill also puts a shorter timeline on certain elements from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including the implementation of a water recycling and reuse\u00a0program, and funding to improve watershed health.\n\n'The moment of reckoning is near':Feds warn huge cuts needed to shore up Lake Mead, Colorado River\n\nA second bill, H.R. 8516, the Wildfire Response Improvement Act, would require the Federal Emergency Management Agency to update its policies regarding wildfires.\u00a0Stanton and other northern Arizona advocates said this would encourage increased funding for post-wildfire recovery, like flooding and mudslides, and treat wildfires as seriously as other natural disasters.\n\nFlooding after wildfires has proven a serious issue in Arizona, for example, especially in northern areas of the state. Wildfires scar the earth and cause soil to become \u201chydrophobic,\u201d preventing them from absorbing water as easily. Heavy monsoon rains after a wildfire can cause downhill flooding and mudslides.\n\nFlagstaff\u2019s mayor declared a state of emergency on Wednesday because of post-wildfire flooding from the\u00a0Pipeline Fire\u2019s burn scar.\n\n\u201cToday, federal support for fighting wildfires ends as soon as the fire is extinguished,\u201d a press release from Stanton\u2019s office read. \u201cBut post-fire risks are immense... Arizona\u2019s state and local governments must bear the entire cost of post-fire expenses.\u201d\n\nCalifornia in graphics:Oak Fire near Yosemite became California's largest wildfire this year\n\nGrijalva's measure mirrors one introduced in the U.S. Senate by Arizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema and authorizes\u00a0the Colorado River Indian Tribes to lease water as part of a wider conservation effort. The House bill adds several changes sought by tribal officials.\n\nUnder the bill, the tribe could lease conserved water to users off the reservation and participate in conservation programs to help shore up regional water supplies. Tribal officials say the revenue could help repair aging water infrastructure.\n\nThe tribe\u00a0needs congressional authorization to lease water, just as 17 tribes in the Colorado River Basin are able to do.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nCRIT Chairwoman Amelia Flores said the measure recognizes the need for drought relief on the river and reflects \"our respect for the Colorado River and our commitment to save the life of the river.\"\n\nOther bills in the package would establish a minimum basic pay and mental health leave for wildland firefighters; require the creation of a 10-year strategy to address wildfire; and direct funding towards research and community planning around the health impacts of wildfire smoke.",

    "body": "A group of House Republicans will be demanding Democrats and President Joe Biden add \u201cBuy American\u201d rules to the so-called infrastructure bill, Breitbart News has exclusively learned.\n\nThe infrastructure bill, proposed and passed last month with the help of\u00a019 Senate Republicans and all Senate Democrats,\u00a0allows the heads of federal agencies to issue waivers to corporations to work around Buy American requirements if they consider the requirement \u201cinconsistent with the public interest,\u201d to not meet \u201csatisfactory quality,\u201d or if they believe buying American will increase costs for the projects.\n\nThe waivers will only be reviewed every five years, according to the bill, and will have to be justified in the Federal Register with a public comment period of no fewer than 30 days.\n\nNow, as the bill sits in the House, a group of House Republicans is readying a campaign to include Buy American requirements to make certain infrastructure projects are not outsourced and offshored to countries like China, India, and others.\n\nThe Republicans are working with\u00a0Chairman and CEO of AVG Advanced Technologies Shalabh Kumar, also the founder of the Republican Hindu Coalition, who is a longtime Buy American advocate.\n\n\u201cAs the bill is written, federal agencies will have complete discretion to ignore American-made products to be used in American infrastructure projects,\u201d the Republicans write to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in a letter exclusively reviewed by Breitbart News:\n\nH.R. 3684 allows federal agencies to bypass the requirement that \u201cgreater than 55% of the total costs of all components of the manufactured product\u201d be manufactured in the United States. If federal agencies determine the buy-American requirement is \u201cinconsistent with the public interest,\u201d does not meet \u201csatisfactory quality,\u201d or that buying American will increase costs for the projects. These ambiguous standards in H.R. 3684 give these agencies a loophole to buy products from China or any other country they wish. Eliminate this exception within The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and make this bill truly one that is Buy American.\n\nAdditionally, the Republicans note that the bill \u201cincludes at least $200 Billion to be used on projects that will require electronic products,\u201d including broadband, electric vehicle charging stations, and water management systems.\n\nBeing that China dominates electronic manufacturing, producing 90 percent of the world\u2019s products in this market, the Republicans write that \u201cit is inappropriate for hard-working Americans\u2019 tax dollars to be spent on Chinese electronics for American infrastructure.\u201d\n\nA provision, the Republicans propose, must be included in the bill to ensure electronic manufacturing cannot be offshored to China from the United States.\n\n\u201cThe American people want and expect American infrastructure to be made in America with American products,\u201d they write.\n\nAfter Senate Republicans worked with Democrats to pass the bill out of the Senate, Breitbart News exclusively reported how such Buy American requirements were kept out of the legislation. Mainly,\u00a0Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) had sought GOP and Democrat support for an amendment\u00a0that would require \u201cmaterials used in infrastructure projects are made in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe amendment failed as Senate Republicans largely vowed to oppose the bill altogether and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), along with Democrats and Republicans quickly shut down debate over amendments.\n\nIn April, 51 percent of Republican voters\u00a0told Gallup\u00a0pollsters they held a negative view of foreign trade, specifically foreign imports, seeing it as a threat to the U.S. economy.\u00a0By comparison, in the year 2000, 59 percent of Republican voters had a positive view of foreign trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest Pew Research Center\u00a0survey finds\u00a0that Republicans who now say that limiting China\u2019s influence and power is a top priority has increased from 39 percent in 2018 to 63 percent in 2021. The loss of American jobs to China remains one of Americans\u2019 biggest concerns with the communist county, the survey reveals.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2018, U.S. free trade with China has eliminated\u00a0at least 3.7 million\u00a0American jobs. In 1985, before China entered the WTO, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $6 billion. In 2019, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled more than $345 billion.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every one manufacturing job\u00a0supports\u00a0an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

    "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats are seizing opportunities in states like New York to draw friendly House districts aimed at knocking out Republican incumbents, making unexpected gains in the decennial practice that the GOP has dominated over the last 10 years.\n\nEven so, Senate Republicans say they still have no interest in new federal legislation to ban partisan gerrymandering. And the recent Democratic gains haven't swayed them, even as the Cook Political Report found last week that Democrats are \"on track to net two to three seats from new maps alone.\"\n\n\"That's just the way the game has always been played,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said with a shrug.\n\nAsked whether he'd support federal legislation to limit partisan gerrymandering, he said: \"Nah, just the courts can handle it.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he doesn't support new legislation to put guardrails on gerrymandering.\n\n\"I don't have any silver bullets for it,\" he said. \"The main protection is the Voting Rights Act in minority voting districts. Other than that, it's pretty much the wild, Wild West.\"\n\nThe cycle isn\u2019t over yet, and the balance of power could still change as battles play out in courtrooms and remaining states.\n\nBut regardless of which way it swings, Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, said in an interview that Congress should stay out of redistricting battles.\n\n\"I think we should leave it to the states to figure it out,\" he said.\n\nThe House has passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act, and the Freedom to Vote Act, which would set new rules against the practice of drawing districts to benefit one party or the other. The Freedom to Vote Act has 50 votes in the Senate but lacks a path around the 60-vote threshold, having stalled because of unanimous Republican opposition.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 who oppose many of the voting provisions in the far-reaching bill \u2014 say they aren't interested in breaking off the redistricting limits to pass separately.\n\n\"I think it's best left to the states,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the Republican leadership. \"And the states go too far. The courts have every right to step in \u2014 and often do.\"\n\nRepublicans are going to court to challenge a New York state map Democrats approved last week, which creates 22 districts that lean Democratic and just four that lean Republican. In a cruel twist, New York Republicans are feeling the pain that their counterparts across the country mercilessly inflicted on Democrats over the last decade.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., accused Democrats of trying to \"cheat\" in New York and said on Fox News that the GOP \"very well could\" lose up to four seats as a result of the new map.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump lamented in a statement last week that \"Republicans are getting absolutely creamed with the phony redistricting going on all over the Country.\"\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the Democrats' House campaign arm, who advocated for an even more aggressive gerrymander in a recent memo, defended his state's decision when he was asked about the Republican charges of hypocrisy.\n\n\"I'd ask them why every one of them voted against H.R. 1, which would have banned gerrymandering,\" he said.\n\nAmong the opponents of the House's anti-gerrymandering measures is Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, whose Staten Island-based district is being carved up and redrawn to help Democrats.\n\nAsked whether, in light of that, she'd favor new federal legislation to bar gerrymandering, Malliotakis said: \"These maps should be nonpartisan maps. OK? It's not good, regardless of which party is in control, to be drawing politically gerrymandered districts.\n\n\"It's the people that should be deciding who their representatives are, not the other way around,\" she said.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Republicans can drop their filibuster of the Freedom to Vote Act if they want to abolish partisan gerrymandering.\n\n\"Unilateral disarmament really doesn't work,\" Blumenthal said. \"We have to play by the rules that exist, even as we want to change the rules, to protect against exactly this kind of abuse.\"\n\nReferring to the bill that failed after senators split along party lines, he said: \"We brought it to the floor. And if there are any takers, we could do it again.\"",

Brian Kemp is \"sitting in Stacey Abram's chair.\"\nStacey Abrams, a Democrat who previously served as\u00a0minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, came under fire after the state's 2018 gubernatorial race\u00a0for refusing to concede her loss against Kemp.\n\"The Republican who is sitting in Stacey Abrams\u2019 chair just signed a despicable voter suppression bill into law to take Georgia back to Jim Crow,\" Warren tweeted.\nShe added that the U.S. Senate \"must pass the #ForThePeople Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act immediately \u2013 our democracy is at stake tonight\" in reference to H.R. 1, a Democrat-proposed bill that would expand absentee voting, end gerrymandering and restrict \"dark money\" political donations, among other things.\nWarren's tweet came in response to a video of state capitol police arresting Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon on Thursday after she knocked on the Kemp's office door while\u00a0he was live-streaming an announcement about a new Georgia voting law,\u00a0the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\nThe law, which Kemp approved on Thursday after the state's Republican-controlled legislature approved the bill, calls for changing the rules and processes for requesting an absentee ballot, including requiring voters to present valid forms of photo identification. It also limits drop boxes and the early voting period for runoffs.\nJOURNALIST JAKE SHERMAN SLAMMED FOR CLAIMING 'IT'S EASIER TO BUY A GUN THAN REGISTER TO VOTE IN GEORGIA'\nKemp called H.R. 1 an \"unconstitutional power grab\" in a Thursday interview with Fox News.\nThe Georgia bill, H.B. 513, \"further secures\" Georgia's \"absentee\u00a0ballots by mail by requiring a\u00a0photo I.D., which\u00a0the vast majority of Georgians' support,\" he said.\u00a0\"It is also adding days of early\u00a0voting on the weekends.\"\nREPUBLICANS LAUNCH 'STOP STACEY' TO DEFEAT ABRAMS IN GEORGIA IN 2022\n\"We\u2019re expanding the right to\u00a0vote in Georgia.\u00a0You\u2019re not hearing that from the\u00a0other side.\u00a0That\u2019s what the truth is, as\u00a0well as further securing\u00a0absentee ballot boxes, which\u00a0didn\u2019t exist before,\" he said.\nDemocrats, however, have argued that the legislation reflects Jim Crow-era laws and puts voters of color at a disadvantage. Abrams in a Thursday tweet said the law targets\u00a0\"Black and brown voters\" and led \"to the arrest of a Black legislator who was advocating for the voting rights of her constituents,\" which she said\u00a0is a \"reminder of Georgia\u2019s dark past.\"\n\"We must fight for the future of our democracy,\" she tweeted.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPresident Biden echoed that sentiment in a\u00a0Friday statement condemning H.B. 513 as \"an attack on the right to vote in Georgia.\"\n\"Instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote,\" the statement said. \"...This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century.

The latter is expected to pass as well, by a simple majority reconciliation vote in the Senate if necessary. But unknowns loom: What happens when agenda items that can be filibustered come to the fore? How seriously do Democrats take the need to pass sweeping democracy reforms , given that Republicans are entrenching anti-majoritarian tactics everywhere, which could help them win the House, crippling Biden's agenda? Won't that force the issue of filibuster reform? Advertisement Story continues below advertisement On MSNBC, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) floated a timetable to pass those democracy reforms, known as S. 1 and H.R. 1, potentially by August. Interviewer Mehdi Hasan noted that action on immigration, police reform and voting rights are all subject to the filibuster, and that the death of one Democratic senator could end their majority. Then this happened HASAN: Time isn't on your side. SCHUMER: I agree we have to move quickly. I would say the deadline for S. 1 is \u2026 probably by August or so. We're consulting with experts. When is the latest that S. 1 can undo some of the despicable and frankly racist changes that some of these Republican legislatures have made? Schumer didn't commit to reforming the filibuster. But everyone knows passing S. 1 or even large swaths of it \u2014 especially ones blunting GOP voter suppression and extreme gerrymanders \u2014 won't pass without changing the filibuster or eliminating it. Now White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain has spoken positively of Schumer's declaration about a possible August deadline. Post Opinions columnists will offer real-time commentary on Biden's speech to Congress. Follow along with their conversation starting at 8:45 p.m. Wednesday. On a call with columnists, Klain was asked by yours truly how much urgency Biden sees in the need to pass democracy reforms and whether at some point it might be necessary to press Democratic holdouts against filibuster reform (like Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia) to take it more seriously. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement \u201cDemocracy reform is very important \u2014 it's important to President Biden \u2014 it's important for our democracy, not just for the Democratic Party,\u201d Klain said. \u201cI heard Senator Schumer say last night on TV that his goal is to get H.R. 1 through the Senate this summer.\u201d \u201cThat's a very strong goal, and one we would join him in pursuing,\u201d Klain continued. He added that the White House also hopes to see passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would restore voting rights protections gutted by the Supreme Court. \u201cThis is a high priority for us,\u201d Klain said. \u201cWe're going to work hard to try to get it passed.\u201d This is consistent with previous White House statements in support of democracy reform, and it's good to hear this declaration of willingness to support Schumer's newly articulated timetable. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement To be clear, Klain didn't say anything about filibuster reform. Biden recently told ABC News that he supports restoring the \u201ctalking filibuster,\u201d which would require a senator to actively keep the filibuster going.

Klain also emphasized, as the White House repeatedly has, that Biden still remains fully committed to trying to win bipartisan support for much of his agenda. Klain signaled optimism about the possibility of deals on infrastructure repair and police reform. Biden and Democrats have struck a difficult balance: They've signaled real openness to Republican input on major Biden priorities, without getting dragged into efforts to dramatically whittle down their ambitions and chase bipartisan support that won't ever materialize. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Yet on voting rights and the filibuster, tough decisions will simply have to happen soon. There is no chance that democracy reform can get the support of 10 Republican senators to break a filibuster. Meanwhile, Republicans are rushing forward with voter suppression efforts everywhere, while openly threatening retribution against private corporations that dare to point it out. And Republicans are declaring that extreme gerrymanders could help them win back the House. Some experts think that could happen even if Democrats win the national House popular vote. What's more, Republicans are increasingly trying to memory-hole the Jan. 6 insurrection, refusing to go along with a serious accounting into it and coming up with almost comically dishonest ways to downplay Donald Trump's role in inciting it, further underscoring their ongoing radicalization against democracy.

    "body": "Cold-calling donors on Election Day in 2014, he told one skeptical constituent: \u201cIn a sense, I\u2019m calling from the future. I\u2019m calling from a time when candidates will have an incentive to reach out to the small donors of the world.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the House will consider whether to make that world a reality.\n\nIn the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol breach and an unprecedented assault on the integrity of the 2020 election, Democratic congressional leaders have made passing it their top priority.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Sarbanes the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the legislation in a speech on the House floor Tuesday,  crediting his \u201clong-term dedication\u201d to advancing democracy.\n\nThe bill \u2014 H.R. 1, the For the People Act \u2014 seeks to drastically broaden access to the ballot at a time when GOP state lawmakers are trying to advance more voting restrictions. It would expand early, absentee and mail-in voting, while also enabling automatic voter registration and trying to end partisan gerrymandering.\n\nAnd it seeks to amplify the power of grass-roots donors to counter the influence of big money in politics, through a small-dollar donor matching system.\n\n\u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d said Sarbanes, a Baltimore native who chairs the Democrats\u2019 Democracy Reform Task Force and is the son of the late Sen. Paul Sarbanes.\n\nA similar version of the bill was approved by the Democratic-majority House in 2019, but died in the Republican-controlled Senate. \n\nWith Democrats now holding 50 Senate seats and the tiebreaking vote of  Vice President Harris, some liberal lawmakers are pushing to get H.R. 1 through that chamber without a single Republican vote \u2014 a scenario that would require ditching the filibuster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never needed it more than we needed it in this moment, when you look at what\u2019s happening across the country,\u201d Sarbanes said, citing Republican attempts to restrict voting access as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to sow distrust in the U.S. electoral system leading up to the Capitol attack.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a piece of legislation that can stop that voter suppression effort in its tracks, broadly expand people\u2019s access to the ballot box .\u2009.\u2009. and push back against this undue influence that big money has on our politics and the way we govern in America,\u201d Sarbanes said.\n\nUnder the campaign-finance overhaul included in H.R. 1, candidates would be able to opt into a six-to-one matching system for small-dollar donations. Just like in Sarbanes\u2019s experiment, they would only qualify to unlock the funds if they raise $50,000 from at least 1,000 small-dollar donors first, and agree not to take certain PAC money.\n\nThe matching funds would be sourced not from taxpayers \u2014 as Republican critics have frequently and incorrectly asserted \u2014 but from civil settlements or criminal fees the federal government wins against corporate wrongdoers or major tax evaders.\n\nIn the future Sarbanes envisions, a $50 donation from a donor of modest means would be worth $350 to the candidate.\n\nSarbanes, a lawyer who worked for the state Education Department before running for Congress, said he became interested in campaign-finance issues soon after taking office, when he saw gun-control and climate-change legislation stymied by opposing lobbyists and fat checks from special-interest groups.\n\nThen came the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling in 2010 \u2014 \u201cunleashing super PACS on our politics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat it did was it kind of woke up the public to the role that big money was having,\u201d Sarbanes said.\n\nHe began experimenting with his own campaign finance in the 2012 cycle. In his gerrymandered central Maryland district, he didn\u2019t have much to lose. \u201cThe idea was to pilot by my own design, in my own district, a set of incentives that would track with or mimic what a small-donor matching system might look like,\u201d he said.\n\nA growing number of states and localities \u2014 including Maryland, the District and Montgomery County \u2014 have adopted public matching-fund systems in recent years, although theirs use taxpayer money.\n\nBut no such system exists for congressional candidates.\n\nSo Sarbanes improvised. He found himself hosting more in-district events to reach voters, including in poorer neighborhoods whose residents would not be targeted by most politicians. But Sarbanes didn\u2019t want $5,000 from them, only $5.\n\n\u201cThe impact it had on my own behavior taught me a lot about the virtues of a system like this,\u201d he said.\n\nHis breakthrough moment, he said, came in the Glen Burnie shopping mall parking lot that day in 2014, when he convinced the skeptical woman to give him $5. There was something more rewarding about it, he recalled, than any check from a lobbyist could have been.\n\n\u201cI think maybe the future is now,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where if we can get a system like this in place, all the incentives can shift, and you\u2019ll see candidates that will finally reach out and build those bridges and connections to everyday Americans who maybe don\u2019t have a ton of money, but they can give something, and they want their voice to be heard.\u201d",

Gen. H.R. McMaster says he likes some of what he sees so far in President Biden's approach to China.\n   McMaster was President Donald Trump's national security adviser for about a year. Before that, he was a soldier and a writer. He's thinking about the long-term U.S. competition with China.\n   \n   \n\n   Relations grew worse under Trump and have yet to change much under Biden. McMaster contends it's unlikely any president will return to the old strategy of trying to engage China in the rules of the international system.\n   \"I think we have to take a different approach at this point,\" he said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition. \"I think we have to recognize that the [Chinese Communist] Party is what the party is \u2014 especially under Xi Jinping.\"\n   Instead, the United States, along with its allies in Europe and elsewhere, needs to \"compete more effectively\" with China, McMaster said.\n   He also urges a \"multinational approach\" for dealing with Beijing militarily.\n   Below are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity.\n      \n   Interview Highlights\n   On the previous approach of trying to engage China in the rules of the international system\n   Well, there's nothing wrong with that approach except for the fact that I think it was still based on this assumption that we were going to change China \u2014 that our international approach would essentially moderate China's behavior and the Chinese Communist Party would eventually see the tremendous benefit of playing by the rules. I think we have to take a different approach at this point. I think we have to recognize that the party is what the party is \u2014 especially under Xi Jinping, who has extended his rule already once and will do so again, almost certainly. So it's a shift, really, from this idea that we can make the case to China's Communist Party leaders that they should be more like us. Instead, I think what we have to do is to compete more effectively. I think it's really important for us to recognize the need for multilateral cooperation.\n   \n   \n\n   On whether the Trump administration made progress by confronting China with tariffs\n   I think they did make tremendous progress. And I mean, there's certain aspects of President Trump and his administration's implementation of the policy. For example, I mean, I don't see how tariffs on our allies help with China. But I was all for tariffs on China as a way to get China to understand there's a cost associated with its unfair trade and economic practices. I think the Biden administration is determined to bring it to the next level, and I hope they do that. I wish him all success in doing so. And in fact, I think Europe in particular has to take a tougher stance.\n   \n   \n\n   On whether a trade war just goes on forever if China doesn't change its approach\n   Well, potentially. And what we should do is try to be more effective. And to be more effective we have to recognize China's strategy is fundamentally one of cooption, coercion and concealment. So what China does is they collapse companies and they collapse countries with the lure of access to their market, with the lure of short-term profits, with the lure of Chinese investments. And then, hey, once you're in, they use that to coerce you to support their foreign policy. What's most important is we have to kind of protect ourselves against China's divide-and-conquer approach. We have to really work on this problem set together.\n      On whether President Biden's focus on U.S. cooperation with Europe, Australia, Japan and other allies would be more effective against China than just the United States going it alone\n   If we are united, right. I think it's really important to understand that our relationship with the EU should be more than just better mood music or a better atmosphere at cocktail parties in Paris. We have to, I think, really work hard to try to get the European Union to take action. And I think initially the indicators are good. So I think it's a better relationship, but it's relationship for a purpose. You know, Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken said, \"Hey, we're not going to ask you to choose\" [between the U.S. and China]. I mean, well, you know, they are our allies. I think they should choose. ... This is not a choice between Washington and Beijing. I think that when you look at the broad range of aggressive actions by the Chinese Communist Party, that this is not a U.S.-China problem. This is a whole world China problem.\n   \n   \n\n   On whether there's a serious risk of war with China in years to come as this confrontation evolves\n   Yes, there is. And this is where collective defense and [a] multinational approach to establishing security infrastructure across the Pacific is very important. You've seen multinational exercises more and more involving the Indian navy, for example. The Indians have always been reluctant for anything that even looks kind of like a military alliance. And then, of course, countries who are on kind of the Eurasian rimland and who are subjected to coercion by China are anxious for more for more defense cooperation as well. \n   Bo Hamby, Elena Moore and Simone Popperl produced and edited the audio version of this story.

Integrating early childhood development into U.S. foreign assistance will support the growth and development of the 250 million children under the age of 5 in low- and middle-income countries who currently risk not reaching their full potential as a result of extreme poverty and stunting. UNICEF USA celebrates the achievement of this law as an important step in meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\u00a0\n\nRead more on UNICEF\u2019s efforts to ensure every child has a fair start in life.",

    "body": "Sen.\u00a0Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Tuesday renewed her call for a ban on assault weapons following the deadly shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, on Monday.\n\n\u201cYesterday, our country was forced to endure yet another mass shooting, 10 people dead, including a police officer. All our hearts go out to all the families who lost a loved one yesterday, and the law enforcement who risk their lives in the line of duty,\u201d Feinstein stated during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence, which was scheduled after last week\u2019s deadly shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, where eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian women.\n\n\u201cThese things are not going to stop, members, they\u2019re just not,\u201d California Democrat added. \u201cI\u2019ve sat here for a quarter of a century listening. They don\u2019t stop. And if you give people the ability to easily purchase a weapon that can be devastating to large numbers of people, some of them will use that, under stress or for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Feinstein introduced\u00a0legislation titled\u00a0the \u201cAssault Weapons Ban of 2021,\u201d which would ban\u00a0205 assault weapons. The bill\u00a0is co-sponsored by 34 Senate Democrats and would also ban ammunition magazines holding more than ten rounds.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, suspected gunman\u00a0Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 21, allegedly opened fire inside a\u00a0King Soopers store, killing 10 people, including active-duty police officer Eric Talley, 51, before he was arrested by law enforcement.\n\nAl Aliwi Alissa, a Denver resident, was reportedly shot in the leg during the rampage and received medical attention for his injuries at a nearby hospital.\u00a0Al Aliwi Alissa\u00a0has been charged with\u00a010\u00a0counts\u00a0of\u00a0murder and is believed to be the only shooter.\n\nBoulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty told reporters that investigators have not established a motive.\n\nAl Aliwi Alissa reportedly came to the U.S. from Syria at the age of three-years-old and is an American citizen, according to ABC News reporter Aaron Katersky.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u00a0echoed Feinstein\u2019s remarks Tuesday, calling on Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines along with tightening loopholes in the background check system.\n\nBiden\u2019s support for two House bills \u2014 H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 \u2014 would create universal background checks and expand the length of time a background check can last, respectively, Breitbart News reporter AWR Hawkins has warned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to wait another minute,\u00a0let alone an hour,\u00a0to take common-sense steps that will save lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,\u201d the president said in his remarks at the White House. \u201cWe can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a senator. \u2026 We should do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis\u00a0is not\u00a0and should not be a partisan issue, this is an American issue. It will save lives, American lives, and we have to act,\u201d he added.",

PAT FALLON: And this is just so critically important, and unfortunately, when we pay off these cyber terrorists, we're going to get more of them. And you know, according to the FBI, with the Colonial Pipeline attack, it was based in Russia. And I think personally, Putin's looking the other way. And he's acting like much like Queen Elizabeth did 500 years ago with the privateers raiding Spanish Armada, they were raiding Spanish gold ships. Is this something he's harboring them?

Today, the NBA made public its findings regarding an investigation of the Phoenix Suns and owner Robert Sarver.\n The investigation included information gathered from interviews with 320 persons, including current and former employees of the Suns and the Phoenix Mercury , the WNBA team that Sarver also owns. And, unlike the NFL's probe of the Commanders and Snyder, the NBA's investigation of the Suns and Sarver included some specifics.

Joyce Beatty,\u00a0the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus;\u00a0Philonise Floyd, an activist and George Floyd's brother; high-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump; and other politicians and civil rights leaders.\n\n\"This nation has a moral obligation to make sure that every citizen has full voting rights,\" said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \"Anything short of that is a true threat to our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, about a thousand more people\u00a0loosely gathered near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial\u00a0for\u00a0the Make Good Trouble Rally in Washington, D.C. on the 58th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nAmong the group\u2019s demands are action on voting rights legislation currently stalled in Congress, an end to the Senate filibuster rule and movement on a range of issues including police reform, infrastructure, healthcare and the environment.\n\nLaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, one of the main sponsors of the rally, called it a \"defining moment in the political history of this nation.\"\n\nCliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter said the nationwide rallies follow in the footsteps of the direct action and civil disobedience strategies King used.\n\n\u201cPart of what gives us hope is that we've been here before, and we won,\u201d Albright said.\n\nBrown added many of the demands of the original March of Washington have yet to be addressed, including more protections for voting rights.\n\n\"It's not just about lifting up the legacy of what happened 58 years ago,\" Brown said. \"America has unfinished business.\"\n\nMarch On for Voting Rights called on Congress to pass\u00a0the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act (H.R. 4)\u00a0and the For the People Act (H.R. 1).\n\n\"These bills are incredibly essential to ensure that we have access to the ballot,\"\u00a0said Stasha Rhodes, campaign manager of 51 for 51, an advocacy group for Washington, D.C., statehood and one of the march's organizers.\n\nThe marches oppose almost 400 bills in 48 states that organizers say \"amount to shameful, outright voter suppression,\"\u00a0according to the event website.\n\nMarches for voting rights:Protesters to mark anniversary of March on Washington with nationwide marches\n\nLast year's marches:'This dream is still alive' as thousands rally for racial justice\n\nAt least six bills in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma shorten windows to apply for mail-in ballots,\u00a0according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy nonprofit that tracks voter suppression legislation. Bills in Iowa and Montana call for reducing polling place availability. Georgia and Iowa bills seek to limit\u00a0voting days and hours. Other bills, many of which have already been signed into law,\u00a0ban\u00a0ballot drop boxes and mail-in voting, impose\u00a0harsher voter ID requirements and prohibit\u00a0giving water to voters in line.Advocates say these efforts target Black voters and other voters of color, who have faced voter suppression throughout U.S. history.\n\nNAACP:Voting rights are not a partisan issue. So why is Congress blocking progress?\n\n\"There's relics of the Jim Crow past that we see in these laws and its efforts to prevent the voter turnout of Black and brown communities,\" Rhodes said.\n\nJohnson urged protesters to spend time reflecting on the work of civil rights leaders of the past and to know that the fight for voting rights is not a new battle. He added that marching is not the final step in creating change and that attendees should also contact their local representatives and organize within their own communities.\n\n\"Freedom is a constant struggle,\" he said. \"We have to protect it. We need to speak loudly, in unison, just like those before us did.\"\n\nLaws tighten voting rules:Heirs to John Lewis vow to make 'good trouble' in fight over election laws\n\nContact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.",

    "body": "Here is a look at the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Considered the nation\u2019s most important civil rights legislation since Reconstruction (1865-1877), it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. Following that law, US President Lyndon B. Johnson signed landmark civil rights bills including the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing Act.\n\n\u201cEach year, from 1945 until 1957, Congress considered and failed to pass a civil rights bill. Congress finally passed limited Civil Rights Acts in 1957 and 1960, but they offered only moderate gains. As a result of the 1957 Act, the United States Commission on Civil Rights was formed to investigate, report on, and make recommendations to the President concerning civil rights issues.\u201d - National Park Service\n\nThe act had the longest filibuster in US Senate history, and after the long civil rights struggle, the Senate passed the act 73-27 in July 1964. It became law less than a year after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nMore Republicans voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act than Democrats.\n\nJune 11, 1963 - US President John F. Kennedy asking Congress to enact civil rights legislation during his Radio and Television Report to the American People on Civil Rights.\n\nJune 19, 1963 - Kennedy sends his comprehensive proposal for the Civil Rights Act to the US Congress for consideration. The bill, H.R. 7152, is introduced the following day.\n\nJune 26, 1963 - US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy speaks before the House Committee of the Judiciary in support of H.R. 7152.\n\nOctober 15, 1963 - Robert Kennedy testifies for the second time before the House Judiciary Committee to try to save the bill.\n\nNovember 20, 1963 - A version of the bill passes from the House Judiciary Committee on to the House Rules Committee.\n\nNovember 27, 1963 - Johnson speaks before a joint session of Congress, \u201cNo memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy\u2019s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\u201d\n\nDecember 1963 - The House adjourns with the bill still in committee.\n\nFebruary 17, 1964 - The bill arrives in the Senate.\n\nMarch 30, 1964-June 10, 1964 - The Senate debates the bill for 60 working days, including seven Saturdays, with many attempts to filibuster the bill. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary is not involved.\n\nJune 9-10, 1964 - US Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia filibusters the bill for 14 hours and 13 minutes before the Senate votes 71 to 29 to cloture the bill. A motion to cloture forces an immediate vote. This vote by two-thirds or more brings all debate to an end.\n\nJune 19, 1964 - In a 73 to 27 vote, the Senate adopts an amended bill, which is sent back to the House.\n\nJune 21, 1964 - Three young men volunteering for the voter registration drive, \u201cFreedom Summer,\u201d disappear in segregated Mississippi. Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Earl Chaney were driving to a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) office in Meridian, Mississippi, that evening. This leads to a national outcry, protests and an FBI investigation.\n\nJuly 2, 1964 - The House of Representatives adopts the Senate version of the bill 289-126.\n\nAugust 4, 1964 - The FBI finds the bodies of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi. They had been shot and buried beneath a dam.\n\nDecember 14, 1964 - The Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of the act in the interstate commerce case Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States. The case, initiated by an Atlanta motel seeking to discriminate among its customers based on race, proves to be a major test of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nJune 15, 2020 - The US Supreme Court rules that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination against LGBTQ employees, after consolidated cases were brought on behalf of two gay men fired from their jobs, as a skydiving instructor and a child welfare services coordinator, and on behalf of a transgender woman who lost her position as a funeral home director.",

    "body": "role . Union leaders will have significant influence over several advisory boards, working groups and committees that make recommendations about billions of taxpayer dollars in spending and hundreds of millions in grants. The 2,072-page, $1.2 trillion spending package - H.R. 3684 - also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , mentions at least 10 boards and groups. They will not only have input over massive amounts of federal spending but also help shape policy by making recommendations for both legislative and executive action. For example, unions will have a seat at the table when $500 million in grants for the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program for planning and capital construction is distributed. Capital construction grant awardees are encouraged to form an advisory board, which must include unions. As advisory board members, union representatives track progress of grant commitments for inclusive employment, contracting and economic development goals. It is easy to imagine a scenario where union representatives give better progress marks to awardees that use union labor. Union officials also will have at least one reserved seat on the Truck Leasing Task Force. Among other things, the task force will examine the impact of truck leasing agreements on driver compensation, certain safety and maintenance issues, and incentives for commercial drivers. The task force will recommend regulatory changes in federal, state and local law. Giving unions influence over policy recommendations to federal, state and local governments could end up reducing worker choice and easing union organizing, with little effect on worker safety. In addition, unions will have influence over a program called Grants for Charging and Fueling Infrastructure. The program will distribute $2.5 billion over five years, to create electric vehicle charging and other fuel infrastructure, with much of that going to state and local governments in $15 million grants. Any entity that applies for grants must specify in its application how it will collaborate with unions. Basing grant eligibility, in part, on engagement with labor unions gives them leverage. The Secretary of Energy is given the authority to reject grant applications. So it's possible that some entities that do not agree to use union labor or make concessions to unions will see their applications rejected. The bill also mandates that unions be consulted on various other topics, such as commuter rail, railroad schedules and practice, and the \"training, qualification and certification programs of locomotive engineers and conductors of railroad carriers.\" In addition to having a guaranteed seat at the table on all of these committees and working groups, unions stand to directly gain financially from the bill. For example, union training funds stand to take in millions in grant money. The Career Skills Training program awards grants to certification programs for those installing energy-efficient technology in buildings. The nonprofits that receive these grants, which can be up to $10 million each, must have equal participation from industry and unions. Another provision of the bill amends existing law to define labor union training programs as Industrial Research and Assessment Centers (IRAC), which assess and make recommendations to small- and medium-sized businesses about energy efficiency. In addition, the bill gives small- and medium-sized manufacturers priority for grants meant to improve their energy efficiency if an IRAC completes their energy assessment. The bill gives the energy secretary $550 million to fund this program. There's $150 for IRACs themselves and their activities, and $400 million for small- and medium-sized manufacturers that have had an energy assessment completed by an IRAC. Finally, the bill also expands the prevailing wage requirement to new types of employees. A prevailing wage is usually considered the union wage in a geographic area, and it drives federal contracts to unionized firms. It also drives up the costs of federal construction contracts In short, H.R. 3684 gives unions an official inside track to shaping infrastructure funding and policy, now and in the future. It should be noted that unions can and should give input. But the bill grants them outsized influence, given their modest presence in the overall workforce. The provisions of the bill calling for union input may be benign. But they also could be used to put onerous burdens on job creators and to steer work, training, grants and other taxpayer money to unions, filling their coffers and increasing the number of workers who are forced into union membership.

    "body": "Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) confirmed this week that he is negotiating an amnesty deal for likely millions of illegal aliens with Senate Democrats.\n\nIn statements to PunchBowl News, Cornyn confirmed that he is hammering out the details of an expansive amnesty deal with Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) that could give green cards, and eventually American citizenship, to illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, those given Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and illegal aliens who work on farms.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a proposal to deal with DACA, a bipartisan border solutions bill, if there\u2019s a deal to be had on farmworkers, and TPS recipients,\u201d Cornyn told PunchBowl News this week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where TPS figures in all this. But that\u2019s the current proposal, so we\u2019ll see if we can agree on some parameters for those three things: DACA [illegal aliens], [illegal alien] farmworkers, and the [southern] border.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve agreed to focus on those three things and see if we can come up with some parameters that would make sense and that I can support,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nCornyn said he is hoping to have an amnesty deal drafted by the end of the week to send off to Durbin and other Senate Democrats.\n\nIn March, the Democrat-controlled House \u2014 with support from\u00a030 House Republicans\u00a0\u2014 passed H.R. 1603, known as the \u201cFarm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021,\u201d and H.R. 6, known as \u201cAmerican Dream and Promise Act of 2021.\u201d\n\nTogether, the two plans would give amnesty to about 2.1 million illegal aliens working on U.S. farms and another 4.4 million DACA-enrolled and eligible illegal aliens and those with TPS.\n\nAt the time, 17 Senate Republicans told Breitbart News they will oppose both amnesty plans, including:\n\nThe remaining 33 Senate Republicans have either not stated a clear position on amnesty or have not responded to requests for comments about whether they would support such a measure.\n\nWhile Cornyn negotiates an amnesty deal, many Senate Democrats are seeking to slip an amnesty past Congress through a little-known \u201creconciliation\u201d maneuver. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is crafting a proposal that would include forcing American taxpayers to spend $150 billion on providing amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.\n\nAn amnesty would come as nearly 16 million remain jobless but all of who want full-time jobs. Another 5.3 million Americans are underemployed but likewise, want full-time employment.\n\nAn analysis released this week by the Center for Immigration Studies revealed that amnesty for illegal aliens, which would immediately flood the U.S. labor market with millions of newly legalized foreign workers for whom employers can legally hire, would have a devastating impact on the nation\u2019s ongoing unemployment problem.\n\n\u201cAllowing all illegal immigrants \u2026 to stay and giving them all legal status so they compete with legal immigrants and the native-born throughout the labor market will likely make it increasingly difficult to draw more Americans back into the labor market,\u201d research Steven Camarota detailed.\n\nAlready, current immigration levels\u00a0put downward pressure on U.S. wages while\u00a0redistributing\u00a0about\u00a0$500 billion in wealth\u00a0away from America\u2019s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)\u00a0has repeatedly\u00a0found that amnesty for illegal aliens would be a net fiscal drain for American taxpayers while driving down U.S. wages.\n\nEvery year, 1.2 million legal immigrants are given green cards to permanently resettle in the U.S. In addition, 1.4 million foreign nationals are given visas to take American jobs while hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens enter the U.S. annually.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

    "body": "After decades of work from activists pushing the issue, presidential candidates, Congress members, local governments and private institutions have debated whether and how the federal government should issue reparations for Black Americans who are descendants of slaves.\n\nAs the Biden administration promises to confront structural racism and inequality, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers have given their support to H.R. 40, a decades-old bill first introduced by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1989. The bill would create a commission to study slavery and discrimination in the United States\u00a0 and potential reparations proposals for restitution.\n\nIn April, H.R. 40 moved out of committee for the first time, potentially setting up a floor vote on the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing reckoning with racial injustice and the health disparities exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic have called further attention to the ways Black people have faced generations of systemic discrimination.\n\nBut with an issue so large and complex, proponents suggest a range of ways the U.S. could engage in reparations while opponents say the time for redress for slavery and the discrimination that followed has passed.\n\nCalls for reparations for enslaved men and women \u2014 and later, their descendants \u2014 have been made in various forms since the end of the Civil War. But these demands have never been met by the federal government.\n\nIn 1865, Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman ordered that land confiscated from Confederate landowners be divided up into 40-acre portions and distributed to newly emancipated Black families. Following President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, however, the order granting \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was swiftly rescinded by new President Andrew Johnson. The majority of the land was returned to white landowners.\n\nAfter the Civil War, formerly enslaved men and women also argued that their unpaid labor while in bondage entitled them to pensions. Their demands received resistance\u00a0from the federal government, which accused prominent pension supporters of fraud and ignored pension bills brought up in Congress.\n\nBut as the federal government denied land and resources to formerly enslaved people, it created new pathways for land ownership for white Americans. For instance, the federal government passed the Homestead Act in 1862, granting 160-acre plots to applicants.\n\n\u201cBlack families received no assets from the federal government while large numbers of white families received substantial assets as a starting point for building wealth in the United States\u201d under the act, said William Darity, a professor of public policy at Duke University. Darity recently co-authored\u00a0a book on reparations with folklorist Kirsten Mullen\u00a0titled\u00a0\u201cFrom Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d\n\nDarity added that calls for reparations are a \u201cspecific claim that is connected to the failure to provide the ancestors of today's living descendants who were deprived of the 40-acre land grants that they were promised.\u201d\n\nAfter the war and during the Reconstruction era, Black Southerners made political, social and economic progress, but these gains were quickly overturned. Discrimination was further entrenched through laws regulating every facet of Black life, including housing restrictions, legal segregation and racially motivated terrorism and lynchings.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Black Americans also continued to be denied opportunities to build wealth under federal programs that benefited white families and communities.\n\nUnder the GI Bill, for example, \u201cmortgage and school tuition benefits extended to black soldiers were devalued due to state endorsed and enforced segregation,\u201d law professor Adrienne Davis argued in a pro-reparations human rights brief published in 2000.\n\n\"There were far fewer places they could attend school or purchase housing,\" Davis wrote. \"The schools they were able to attend and houses they were able to buy were less valuable because they were black institutions and neighborhoods, respectively, in an economy that valued whiteness.\"\n\nExcluding domestic and farm workers from Social Security legislation effectively shut out 60 percent of Black people \u201cacross the U.S. and 75 percent in southern states who worked in these occupations,\u201d according to policy think tank the Brookings Institution.\n\nExperts argue that such omissions from federal policy have not been fully corrected and have been magnified by widening health, education, employment and housing disparities, as well as a lack of access to capital.\n\nCollectively, these historical and current disadvantages have led reparations proponents to argue that while slavery is where denials of wealth and equal rights began, the cumulative effects of both slavery and systematic federal denials of opportunity that followed continue to impact the descendants of enslaved people in the present.\n\nIn recent years, reparations have often been discussed alongside the racial wealth gap, or the difference between wealth held by white Americans compared to that of other races.\n\nResearch has found that the gap between white and Black Americans has not narrowed in recent decades. White households hold roughly 10 times more wealth than Black ones, similar to the gap in 1968. While Black Americans account for roughly 13 percent of the American population, they hold about 4 percent of America\u2019s wealth. Experts note the gap is not due to a lack of education or effort but rather is due to a lack of capital and resources that have left Black individuals more vulnerable to economic shocks and made it difficult for Black families to build inheritable wealth over generations.\n\nDarity and Mullen say closing this wealth gap should be a fundamental goal of a reparations program and should guide how such a program is structured. In their book, Darity and Mullen call for a system of reparations that primarily consists of direct financial payments made by the federal government to eligible Black Americans who had at least one ancestor enslaved in the United States.\n\nProposals for reparations programs have also been raised by reparations advocacy groups in recent decades. The National African American Reparations Commission, for example, has a 10-point reparations plan that includes calls for a national apology for slavery and subsequent discrimination; a repatriation program that would allow interested people to receive assistance when exercising their \u201cright to return\u201d to an African nation of their choice; affordable housing and education programs; and the preservation of Black monuments and sacred sites, with the proposals benefiting any person of African descent living in the US.\n\nOther proposals, like one proposed by Andre Perry and Rashawn Ray for the Brookings Institution, would also specifically provide restitution to descendants with at least one ancestor enslaved in the U.S., coupling direct financial payment with plans for free college tuition, student loan forgiveness, grants for down payments and housing revitalization and grants for Black-owned businesses.\n\n\u201cMaking the American Dream an equitable reality demands the same U.S. government that denied wealth to Blacks restore that deferred wealth through reparations to their descendants,\u201d they wrote last year.\n\nThe variety of proposals show that even among supporters of reparations, there is some disagreement about what a full program should look like and what exactly should be described as \u201ctrue reparations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we would be doing ourselves a huge disservice if we were just talking about financial compensation alone,\u201d said Dreisen Heath, a racial justice researcher with Human Rights Watch.\n\nWhile Heath said she did support and see the value in direct financial payments, she added that money alone \u201cis not going to fix if you were wrongly convicted in a racist legal system. That\u2019s not going to fix your access to preventative health care. All of these other harms are connected to the racial wealth gap but are not exclusively defined by or can be relieved by financial compensation.\u201d\n\nSome local governments \u2014 most notably Evanston, Illinois, and Asheville, North Carolina \u2014 are also attempting to issue reparations for historical discrimination Black residents of these areas faced. These attempts have been praised by some proponents, who say the wide-ranging harms of slavery and subsequent discrimination requires a multipronged solution.\n\n\u201cReparations efforts at multiple levels are necessary because the harms were on multiple levels \u2014 the institutional, at the state level and at the federal level,\u201d Heath said. \u201cSpecific harms were committed and need to be remedied in a very specific way. There\u2019s no blanket reparations program for a specific community.\u201d\n\nStill, critics of such programs, like Darity and Mullen, say municipal efforts are not significant enough in scale because of sheer municipal budget restrictions. They also say localized programs simply miss the point.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing racial equity initiatives that are being touted as reparations programs,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cFor us, a reparations program must center on eliminating the racial wealth gap, and putting people on committees and panels is not going to do that.\u201d\n\nDiscussion of how to best conceptualize reparations has spilled over into debates over H.R. 40, which languished in a House subcommittee for more than three decades before being voted out of committee this year. While supporters of the legislation argue it is the best vehicle for better understanding the need for and possible avenues of providing reparations, Darity and Mullen say in its current form, the measure could ultimately do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems with H.R. 40 is that it is not at all clear that it provides us with a direction towards eliminating the racial wealth gap,\u201d Darity said. He added that the bill\u2019s impacts are limited because it creates a commission rather than directly approving a reparations program.\n\nSupporters of the bill, including members of pro-reparations advocacy groups like the National African American Reparations Commission and the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America counter that the bill would do more than simply study the evidence supporting reparations and is a crucial step toward providing reparative justice.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the bill's main sponsor, and other congressional Democratic leaders have said they hope to move forward with a House floor vote on the bill this summer.\n\nStill, reaction to the legislation not only reveals fundamental differences between reparations proponents but also shows there continues to be a vocal contingent of reparations critics who argue that a federal effort to provide redress for the harms of slavery and the decades of discrimination that followed is unnecessary. Critics say slavery happened too long ago and thus the harms are too old to be repaired. Others say the mere idea of reparations frames Black Americans as helpless.\n\n\u201cReparation is divisive. It speaks to the fact that we are a hapless, hopeless race that never did anything but wait for white people to show up and help us \u2014 and it\u2019s a falsehood,\u201d Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the House, said during debate on H.R. 40 in April. \u201cIt\u2019s demeaning to my parents\u2019 generation.\u201d\n\nExperts argue the focus shouldn\u2019t be on whether reparations are divisive but if they are necessary, saying Black American descendants of enslaved people have a valid claim for redress and restitution.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been this amount of stalling for reparations for Japanese Americans, or around the appropriation for restitution for 9/11 victims, or continued support for Holocaust survivors in the U.S.,\u201d Heath said. \u201cReparation is only seen as a bad word when we\u2019re talking about repair and restitution for Black people.\u201d\n\nUltimately, supporters argue the need for reparations should not be judged based on how popular the issue is publicly but instead should be looked at as a necessary correction for the moral, political and economic failures that have been created by federal policy at the expense of Black Americans.\n\nDarity argued that even if detailed reparations measures are not politically feasible in Congress now, it is important that \u201cthe footprints must be put in place\u201d for future efforts.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the generational relationship to enslavement, you find that it doesn\u2019t really feel all that long ago,\u201d Darity said of efforts to frame reparations as solely focused on the past. \u201cBut what\u2019s more important is that the effects of the period of enslavement are still felt and still embodied in the kinds of consequences for Black lives today.\u201d",

    "body": "As the Biden administration promises to confront structural racism and inequality, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers have given their support to H.R. 40, a decades-old bill first introduced by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1989. The bill would create a commission to study slavery and discrimination in the United States and potential reparations proposals for restitution.In April, H.R. 40 moved out of committee for the first time, potentially setting up a floor vote on the legislation.Meanwhile, the ongoing reckoning with racial injustice and the health disparities exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic have called further attention to the ways Black people have faced generations of systemic discrimination.But with an issue so large and complex, proponents suggest a range of ways the U.S. could engage in reparations while opponents say the time for redress for slavery and the discrimination that followed has passed.Demands for reparations have endured for more than a centuryCalls for reparations for enslaved men and women \u2014 and later, their descendants \u2014 have been made in various forms since the end of the Civil War. But these demands have never been met by the federal government.In 1865, Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman ordered that land confiscated from Confederate landowners be divided up into 40-acre portions and distributed to newly emancipated Black families. Following President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, however, the order granting \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was swiftly rescinded by new President Andrew Johnson. The majority of the land was returned to white landowners.After the Civil War, formerly enslaved men and women also argued that their unpaid labor while in bondage entitled them to pensions. Their demands received resistance from the federal government, which accused prominent pension supporters of fraud and ignored pension bills brought up in Congress.But as the federal government denied land and resources to formerly enslaved people, it created new pathways for land ownership for white Americans. For instance, the federal government passed the Homestead Act in 1862, granting 160-acre plots to applicants.\u201cBlack families received no assets from the federal government while large numbers of white families received substantial assets as a starting point for building wealth in the United States\u201d under the act, said William Darity, a professor of public policy at Duke University. Darity recently co-authored a book on reparations with folklorist Kirsten Mullen titled \u201cFrom Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century.\u201dDarity added that calls for reparations are a \u201cspecific claim that is connected to the failure to provide the ancestors of today's living descendants who were deprived of the 40-acre land grants that they were promised.\u201dAfter the war and during the Reconstruction era, Black Southerners made political, social and economic progress, but these gains were quickly overturned. Discrimination was further entrenched through laws regulating every facet of Black life, including housing restrictions, legal segregation and racially motivated terrorism and lynchings.A bus station in Durham, N.C., May 1940. (Jack Delano / Library of Congress)In the 1930s and 1940s, Black Americans also continued to be denied opportunities to build wealth under federal programs that benefited white families and communities.Under the GI Bill, for example, \u201cmortgage and school tuition benefits extended to black soldiers were devalued due to state endorsed and enforced segregation,\u201d law professor Adrienne Davis argued in a pro-reparations human rights brief published in 2000.\"There were far fewer places they could attend school or purchase housing,\" Davis wrote. \"The schools they were able to attend and houses they were able to buy were less valuable because they were black institutions and neighborhoods, respectively, in an economy that valued whiteness.\"Excluding domestic and farm workers from Social Security legislation effectively shut out 60 percent of Black people \u201cacross the U.S. and 75 percent in southern states who worked in these occupations,\u201d according to policy think tank the Brookings Institution.Experts argue that such omissions from federal policy have not been fully corrected and have been magnified by widening health, education, employment and housing disparities, as well as a lack of access to capital.Collectively, these historical and current disadvantages have led reparations proponents to argue that while slavery is where denials of wealth and equal rights began, the cumulative effects of both slavery and systematic federal denials of opportunity that followed continue to impact the descendants of enslaved people in the present.A procession of protesters carrying signs for equal rights, integrated schools, decent housing, and an end to bias in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 28, 1963. (Warren K. Leffler / Library of Congress)Experts disagree on what reparations should look likeVideo: Facebook was complicit in what happened, says writer after oversight ruling (MSNBC)In recent years, reparations have often been discussed alongside the racial wealth gap, or the difference between wealth held by white Americans compared to that of other races.Research has found that the gap between white and Black Americans has not narrowed in recent decades. White households hold roughly 10 times more wealth than Black ones, similar to the gap in 1968. While Black Americans account for roughly 13 percent of the American population, they hold about 4 percent of America\u2019s wealth. Experts note the gap is not due to a lack of education or effort but rather is due to a lack of capital and resources that have left Black individuals more vulnerable to economic shocks and made it difficult for Black families to build inheritable wealth over generations.Darity and Mullen say closing this wealth gap should be a fundamental goal of a reparations program and should guide how such a program is structured. In their book, Darity and Mullen call for a system of reparations that primarily consists of direct financial payments made by the federal government to eligible Black Americans who had at least one ancestor enslaved in the United States.Image: People take part in events to mark Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in Texas, in New York (Andrew Kelly / Reuters file)Proposals for reparations programs have also been raised by reparations advocacy groups in recent decades.

That includes 90% of Americans who align with Democrats, 73% who consider themselves independents and 42% of Republicans.\u201d It also includes 55 percent of moderate and liberal Republicans. Quite simply, it is the worst possible bill for Republicans to filibuster, which is precisely why Democrats should use it to make the case for filibuster reform. The spectacle of Republicans standing for hours or days on the floor objecting to an investigation into an assault on Congress would be a teachable moment for Americans. It would underscore how utterly craven, partisan and irresponsible the MAGA GOP has become. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) should not let Republicans off the hook with a single cloture vote. He must make them conduct a real, talking filibuster so that their unhinged partisanship is evident for all to see. Democrats should force Republicans to break the record for the longest filibuster \u2014 slightly more than 24 hours by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond (R), a notorious segregationist, on the Civil Right's Act of 1957. If Republicans are still going at it after surpassing Thurmond's record, Democrats can proceed with a number of filibuster reforms, including a carve out for national security bills with minimal funding or for bills in defense of democracy (just as reconciliation is a filibuster exception with conditions). After watching Republicans filibuster a Jan. 6 commission for hours, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) might begin to feel differently about preserving the procedural tactic. But Schumer should not stop there. He should give Republicans another shot at demonstrating the filibuster is incompatible with preservation of fundamental rights and democratic governance. Put on the floor H.R. 4, the bill to reauthorize the preclearance process under the Voting Rights Act. Manchin has said he is in favor of such a bill. It has none of the controversial provisions contained in H.R. 1 (e.g., campaign finance reform). If 10 Republicans do not emerge to pass such a bill \u2014 which has previously garnered bipartisan, nearly unanimous support \u2014 then he can compel Republicans to mimic the Thurmond anti-civil rights filibuster for another day or more. In essence, rather than try fruitlessly to strike deals with Republicans on big, expensive proposals, Democrats should consider breaking the back of the filibuster and highlighting GOP obstruction. By moving ahead with the Jan. 6 commission and the VRA preclearance bill, he can show just how unreasonable Republicans are and perhaps create new exceptions for the filibuster. After that, Republicans might be more amenable to reaching an agreement on Biden's popular infrastructure bill.

Axios is withholding the name of the orphanage, at the request of a source who shared the letter, out of concern for the children's safety.But they represent only a tiny fraction of children who've lost both parents over two decades of war, and it's not yet clear how many Afghan orphans have been evacuated in the final days of the U.S. withdrawal and how many are left behind.Details: \"We are extremely concerned that a lack of action on this matter could result in a new generation of individuals committed to waging war against the United States,\" Rice and McMaster write.\"We know young boys are recruited, trained, and abused by the Taliban, and that young girls are forced to become wives to soldiers.

These children do not have to face their current fate. With your help, they can be removed and safely placed with loving families who will give them an opportunity to lead a full life, free of violence, abuse, and oppression.\"What they're saying: McMaster, reached by phone Tuesday night, told Axios he would have preferred for the letter to remain private but that he signed it to try to save children by highlighting \"the Taliban's record of child abuse on an industrial scale.\"At this stage it's vitally important that the private sector work with our government and other governments to mitigate the human catastrophe in Afghanistan,\" he said.More from Axios: Sign up to get the latest market trends with Axios Markets.

    "body": "In the middle of a brazen nationwide assault on voting rights of a kind we have not seen since Jim Crow was established after the Civil War, some are skeptical that Democrats in Washington will respond. If they don't, that would allow the filibuster to block voting rights legislation and consign the party (and its majority of U.S. voters) to possible permanent minority status. After decades of studying and working with the Senate, we think the signs point the other way: There are seven reasons to believe that the filibuster will be reformed and voting rights legislation will be passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Biden. First, some context. The \u201cbig lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen did not end with Donald Trump's departure from office. It has only intensified, with over 216 bills in more than 41 states targeting our system of voting based on that falsehood. Trump and his acolytes in many of these states have continued to pour on the disinformation. They are trying to undo the things that made the 2020 election one of the most successful in history, such as early voting, drop boxes, mail-in voting and high minority turnout. A number of these bills would even make it possible for Trump's allies in state legislatures to take steps to reverse future elections , irrespective of the will of the voters. That's where Congress comes in. Lawmakers can set national minimums for best practices to prevent open targeting of minority voters and block legislative hijacks of election outcomes. Those issues are addressed by bills such as the For the People Act (which already passed the House as H.R. 1), the John Lewis Voting Rights Act (which passed the House as H.R. 4) and the Preventing Election Subversion Act of 2021 sponsored by Sen. Rafael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.). The obstacle of course, is the filibuster, which has already twice blocked the For the People Act. But that can change. As we explain in a new paper , reform is possible if 51 votes can be mustered in the Senate: all 50 Democrats and Vice President Harris, voting as the presiding officer to break a tie. As when the GOP eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in 2017, modifying it to pass voting rights legislation can be achieved with a bare majority. Manchin thinks the filibuster fosters bipartisanship. Here's why it doesn't. First, Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) would raise a point of order that cloture on election-related legislation can be decided by a simple majority vote, which would be denied by the presiding officer (acting on advice of the parliamentarian). The leader would then appeal the ruling to the Senate \u2014 in a vote which, if it's done in reconsideration of a failed cloture vote, is not subject to debate. The Senate would then vote on the appeal. If the appeal won a simple majority, the new precedent would prevent the filibuster of voting legislation. It would leave the filibuster in place for other legislation (though it would obviously also provide a road map for eliminating it in other cases). That so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d is only one of many examples of how filibuster reform could be achieved. While the workings of the Senate are inherently unpredictable, we think some kind of filibuster reform is more likely than not before the end of 2021 to pass voting rights legislation. The Supreme Court clearly won't protect voting rights. But Congress can. First, the sentiment in the Democratic caucus seems to be swinging decidedly in the direction of filibuster reform. According to The Washington Post, 19 of the 50 Democratic senators are committed to eliminating the filibuster, another 15 are committed to changes and 14 are open to them, with only Joe Manchin III ( D-W.Va .) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) more reserved \u2014 so far. Even Biden , formerly a long-serving senator and a champion of its traditions who had long been viewed as an obstacle, has reportedly come around. Second, Manchin is not as immovable an obstacle as he appears. In March, Manchin suggested that he would be open to using the reconciliation process to pass voting rights legislation if all efforts at bipartisanship failed. Our report explains how that intricate maneuver could work \u2014 and, as importantly, Manchin's statement shows he is contemplating voting rights legislation by a simple majority. He has since expressed openness to other reforms of the kind we also outline in our paper, such as lowering the cloture threshold and shifting the onus onto the Senate minority to maintain the filibuster. When asked about lowering the vote total needed for cloture, he said \u201cI'm open to looking at it, I'm just not open to getting rid of the filibuster, that's all\u2026.\u201d Manchin has also offered a compromise proposal of his own in response to H. R. 1 and has reportedly spent considerable time negotiating details; a deal is said to be near, and he is actively seeking GOP support. It seems improbable that he would be spending all that time on the legislation if he were not at least willing to consider reforming the filibuster to push his plan into law. According to reports, he is getting what he wants. When that happens, he is a compromiser, as he has proven over and over again throughout his long career. Democrats complain about Joe Manchin, but they're lucky to have him Third, if Manchin agrees to reform, Sinema seems less likely to stand truly alone against her caucus and a bill she has already said she supports. Though Sinema has indicated opposition to \u201cending\u201d and \u201celiminating\u201d the filibuster , a closer look at her words makes clear that she might not oppose all modifications. That is why she has called for an open debate and has been careful not to say she opposes any reform. In an op-ed for The Post, Sinema called for the Senate \u201cto debate the legislative filibuster, so senators and our constituents can hear and fully consider the concerns and consequences.\u201d Fourth, there is a rich menu of options to do just that: reform, not eliminate, the filibuster. The smoothest path would be for the Senate to create an exception allowing majority votes to pass voting reforms. We call that \u201cdemocracy reconciliation\u201d because it is akin to the budget reconciliation exception the Senate already allows for certain fiscal legislation. That was done by statute, whereas here the easiest way to proceed is by a majority vote on a parliamentary question. But the outcome is the same: voting matters heretofore will be decided by a bare majority. There are many other options that aim to restore the filibuster's balance between minority rights and majority rule. They include reducing to a majority the number of senators needed to open debate in the face of a filibuster; starting at 60 but creating a diminishing threshold for cloture, so that each successive vote on an individual piece of legislation ratchets down the number needed to move on to a final vote (giving the minority significant time to try to persuade the country of their point of view but giving the majority the right to a vote); or shifting the burden from the majority to the minority by flipping the numbers, requiring 41 votes to continue debate instead of the current requirement of 60 needed to proceed to a vote. If filibuster reform happens, some combination of the subject-matter carve-out and multiple other reforms is likely given Manchin and Sinema's apparent inclination to preserve the rule in some substantial form. H.R. 1 can't pass the Senate. But here are some voting reforms that could. Fifth, the brazen outrage of GOP behavior makes filibuster reform much more likely. Manchin was already open to reform back in the spring, even before many of the current GOP voter suppression and election subversion laws had passed in several states. He was particularly angry at the filibuster blocking creation of a commission to examine the Jan. 6 violent insurrection. Now, it's even clearer that state and national Republicans are refusing to compromise on these issues. Sixth, it is a matter of self-preservation for Democrats. All over the country, the ballot is being taken away from Democratic voters. Without the redistricting reforms of H.R. 1, Republicans will likely use the current cycle to practice the extreme gerrymandering that could give them long-term control of the House despite having the support of only a minority of American voters. In 2024, the worst of the state power grab bills could allow GOP-dominated state legislatures to overturn the vote of a majority of their citizens in the presidential election \u2014 what Trump sought but could not achieve last year. The filibuster is here to stay. But this reform could ease Senate gridlock. Seventh, the parade of horribles that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has threatened if the filibuster is touched is overstated. Yes, there will be some drama. But the Senate will recover. It has before. It did previously when the nuclear option was deployed in 2017 to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees , and before that in 2013, when the filibuster was removed for all presidential nominations except Supreme Court ones. Of course, no one really knows what Manchin, Sinema and perhaps a few other hesitant Democrats will do if they're faced with a vote. But there's no reason to assume they won't modify the filibuster \u2014 and there is ample reason to think that they will. Every once in a while, logic actually prevails in the Senate. Here, it inexorably points to filibuster reform. And good thing it does: Our democracy depends upon it.

    "body": "After falling short of a filibuster-proof majority, the For the People Act failed to pass a vote for debate in the Senate by a 50-50 vote.What\u2019s happeningThe For the People Act, the Democrats\u2019 sweeping voting rights legislation, was stymied in the Senate on Tuesday after Republicans filibustered a procedural vote that would have allowed debate on the proposal to begin. All 50 Democrats in the chamber voted to proceed, but the GOP was unified in opposition, leaving the measure well short of the 60-vote threshold needed to break the filibuster.Democratic leaders, who had expected the GOP to block debate, said the vote was a necessary step in a long process toward passing reforms they believe are necessary to counter a wave of restrictive new elections laws passed by state-level Republicans. \u201cThis fight is far from over,\u201d President Biden said. \u201cWe are going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again \u2014 for the people, for our very democracy.\u201dIf passed into law, the For the People Act, also known as H.R.1 and S.1, would represent the most dramatic reforms to U.S. elections in a generation. Among its many provisions are measures to expand early voting, establish nationwide absentee voting and same-day registration, and ban partisan gerrymandering.While there has been some disagreement among Democrats about the specifics of the bill, the main impediment to its passage is the filibuster. In theory, Democrats could change Senate rules and eliminate or modify the filibuster to allow the For the People Act to pass by a simple majority vote \u2014 a path many progressives support \u2014 but all 50 would have to be in agreement. At least two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have said they are staunchly opposed to any plan that would kill or weaken the filibuster.Why there\u2019s debateIn the eyes of many pundits, Tuesday\u2019s failed vote highlighted an unfortunate truth for Democrats: No voting rights bill can pass as long as the filibuster is in place, and there simply isn\u2019t enough support in the party to get rid of it. Though progressives have argued that the For the People Act is critical to countering new Republican election laws they say are an existential threat to American democracy, the party as a whole doesn\u2019t appear to share that same urgency. Some reform advocates say Democratic leaders are more concerned with appearing to fight for voting rights as a way to placate progressive voters than with actually getting anything done.Some on the left are more optimistic. They argue that Manchin and Sinema could ultimately be persuaded to amend the filibuster, now that they\u2019ve seen how far-fetched the prospects of a bipartisan deal on voting rights really are. Others see signs of progress in Manchin, who released his own less-ambitious voting rights proposal last week that nonetheless garnered support from a number of prominent progressives. The Democrats\u2019 best hope of enacting new voting rights legislation, some political analysts say, is to abandon the For the People Act and pursue Manchin\u2019s compromise, or some other pared-back voting rights plan. What\u2019s next Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Tuesday\u2019s vote \u201cthe starting gun, not the finish line.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear what concrete steps he might have available as long as Manchin, Sinema and any other Democratic holdouts hold firm in their stance on the filibuster. Biden, for his part, will use the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d of his presidency to highlight the importance of voting rights reform to the public, activists and key members of Congress, according to press secretary Jen Psaki.PerspectivesDemocrats aren\u2019t committed enough to take the aggressive steps needed \u201cDemocrats claim that democracy is under threat, but they lack the collective will to save it.\u201d \u2014 Russell Berman, The Atlantic Less ambitious bills than the For the People Act are equally doomed \u201cIt may be, as some pundits have opined, that the For the People Act was just a messaging bill, a symbolic gesture for their base, and it was a mistake for Democrats to hype it up as their main voting rights fix. But why should we believe that any of the other voting rights bills waiting in the wings will fare better? As it is, there is no evidence that Republicans will support any of them.\u201d \u2014 Hayes Brown, MSNBC Top Democrats\u2019 support for voting rights is largely empty rhetoric \u201cWhat did Tuesday\u2019s developments prove? Was all of that merely performative \u2014 by Manchin, as well as Senate Democratic leaders? Yes. And for now, it seems to be the only strategy Democrats have.\u201d \u2014 Joan Walsh, The Nation Democrats have bungled the strategy of pursuing voting rights reform \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I philosophically disagree with a lot of what\u2019s in H.R. 1.

While activists want him to pile on the pressure on Manchin and Sinema for voting rights, Biden also needs their votes for all his other priorities; alienating them would be untenable.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Prokop, Vox Democrats are creating room for a small filibuster exception for voting rights \u201cWhere we may be headed is a carveout. \u2026 Surely, democracy and republic saving legislation, you could find a way to do a carevout. And now I think Manchin and Sinema have the permission structure to say \u2018we did all we could \u2026 this isn\u2019t on the level, so now we have to move to a change in Senate rules.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Former Obama adviser David Plouffe to MSNBC Biden should step up pressure on filibuster holdouts \u201cManchin and another Democratic senator, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have resisted the idea of abolishing the filibuster. But if GOP senators continue to stonewall reasonable legislation to protect the right to vote, those two reluctant Democrats must be pressed to recognize that \u2014 at least where protecting democracy is concerned \u2014 the filibuster must go.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Los Angeles Times Democrats can improve their odds by moving on to more reasonable voting rights bills \u201cThe demise of the For the People Act \u2026 will come as a crushing blow to progressives and reformers, who have portrayed the law as an essential tool for saving democracy. But it was a flawed bill that had little chance of testing the limits of what if anything is still possible in Washington.

Congressional Visit Days (CVD) are an effort organized by the MIT Science Policy Initiative (SPI), a student group that works at the intersection of policy and research. On April 5-6, students met with 34 congressional offices representing 18 states to speak with congresspeople and staffers about why scientific funding matters to them and how it has influenced their work.\n\nParticipants of CVD underwent multiple training sessions to learn about mechanisms of science policy, the political landscape of scientific funding, and communication strategies for policy asks. Participants had the chance to meet with the MIT Washington Office for a briefing about specific appropriations requests. Through CVD and meetings with MIT alumni currently involved in science policy, students had the opportunity to bring attention to the importance of continued government investment in science and to learn about potential career trajectories in policy.\n\nStudents and postdocs represented diverse personal experiences and views on the importance of scientific funding, ranging from federal grants supporting their graduate school research to Covid-19 disrupting significant laboratory activity. Tess Carter, a PhD student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, organized CVD along with Rebecca Black, a PhD student in the Department of Biological Engineering. Carter says, \u201cAfter so many years of virtual interactions of all kinds, it was really powerful to sit across from congressional staffers and talk to them about why federal research funding is so important. We were able to share our experiences on how federal funding has helped us get into and stay in research, and how the pandemic led to challenges and ingenuity within the system.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, CVD participants advocated for increasing the federal budget past inflation for scientific programs like the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and Department of Energy. They also discussed bills currently circulating to achieve this, such as the House COMPETES Act (H.R.4521) and the Senate United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) (S.1260).\n\nDiane Zhang, an undergraduate student studying computer science and molecular biology, remarks, \u201cI found it meaningful how appreciative congressional offices were that we came to meet with them. We were there to not only discuss the cost of scientific federal programs, but their value in terms of research output and supporting a career in science.\u201d\n\nOverall, the group advocated for an additional $112.693 billion for scientific funding for fiscal year 2023 across 11 federal scientific agencies and five appropriations subcommittees.",

In February 2021, Congresswomen\ufffd?\ufffdJaime Herrera\ufffd?\ufffdBeutler\ufffd?\ufffd(R-WA) and Katie Porter (D-CA) introduced H.R. 1235, the Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act,\ufffd?\ufffdin the 117th Congress in the House of Representatives. Today, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) have introduced companion legislation in the Senate. The bill prohibits discrimination\ufffd?\ufffdbased solely on disability before, during, and after an organ transplant procedure. This legislation reinforces and supplements rights established or supported by existing civil rights laws, most notably the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Sec. 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.  The bill is named for\ufffd?\ufffdCharlotte Woodward, an\ufffd?\ufffdadult with Down syndrome and member of the NDSS staff who received\ufffd?\ufffda life-saving heart transplant almost ten years ago. Since then, she has advocated tirelessly\ufffd?\ufffdto ensure\ufffd?\ufffdpeople with Down syndrome and other disabilities\ufffd?\ufffdget the same chance that she did.  \"As someone with Down syndrome who has had the opportunity to receive a life-saving heart transplant, I am so very grateful that this bill will give others the same opportunity,\"\ufffd?\ufffdsaid\ufffd?\ufffdCharlotte Woodward.\ufffd?\ufffd\"Too many precious lives have been lost due to discrimination in organ\ufffd?\ufffdtransplantation. I am so very, very thankful for the generosity of my heart donor and that of her loving family. Her gift has allowed me to live my life to the fullest and to go on to advocate for others to be able to do the same. The passage of this bill will be a monumental step towards a more just world,\ufffd?\ufffdand I am proud to play a part in it.\"\ufffd?\ufffd  In addition to enumerating specific instances of potential discrimination, the bill also proactively promotes access to services by requiring health care providers to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures related to organ transplant care. Even so, the bill does not discount their professional judgment through new mandates. Instead, it clarifies what they are already meant to do: refrain from treating patients with disabilities differently than they would if they did not have disabilities.  \"People with disabilities are no less deserving of life-saving organ transplants than people without disabilities,\" said NDSS President and CEO Kandi Pickard. \"We need a federal law to protect the rights of members of our community and to honor the value they bring to society. Charlotte's bill reflects the interstate nature of the organ transplant system, recognizes the need for expedited review when access is denied, and establishes a legal framework for individuals and providers to seek truth and reach meaningful resolution. We are grateful to Senators Rubio and Hassan for introducing this legislation.\"  While Charlotte's bill was introduced almost a year ago, a recent story about a Florida infant named Zion Sarmiento has helped to elevate the issue of organ transplant discrimination. Baby Zion was born in June 2021 with Down syndrome and a congenital heart defect. Despite undergoing several surgeries, Zion needed a heart transplant to survive. He did not receive one and tragically passed away in October. With remarkable grace, the Sarmiento family has chosen to turn their grief into action and has been working with NDSS to advance Charlotte's bill.  \"It is heartless to discriminate against someone in need of an organ transplant because they have a disability,\" Senator Rubio said. \"Zion, a 16-week old baby with Down syndrome, passed away because he was denied an organ transplant. Zion's story is not only devastating, it is unacceptable. This legislation would honor Zion's life and help ensure that what happened to him never happens to anyone else.\"  \"People with disabilities are too often overlooked and in being denied full inclusion can encounter hurdles that many of us cannot even begin to imagine, including when it comes to receiving\ufffd?\ufffdthe life-saving care of an organ transplant,\" said Senator Hassan. \"All individuals should be guaranteed quality of care, and that's something I'll always fight for. I'm proud to help lead this effort with Senator Rubio to make sure that discrimination has no place in medical care.\"  NDSS\ufffd?\ufffdhas resources available to assist those seeking to prevent discrimination in organ transplantation against people with disabilities.

    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is sacrificing vulnerable House members who need the August recess to campaign in their district by pulling them back to Washington roughly a month early to advance their swampy partisan agenda items.\n\nPelosi\u2019s hopes of keeping the wafer-thin House majority are losing major traction. The most vulnerable members usually use the majority of their time during recess to campaign, fundraise, and meet with constituents.\n\nHowever, it looks like their time will be cut short to pass their budget resolution for the so-called infrastructure bill. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) issued a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d telling members the recess has been cut short and will need to return to Washington in two weeks and will stay until their \u201cbusiness\u201d is finished.\n\nFor your scheduling purposes, assuming that the Senate does, in fact, complete work on a budget resolution, the House will return to session on the evening of August 23 to consider that budget resolution and will remain in session until our business for the week is concluded.\n\nThe members were originally supposed to return on September 20. But, Tuesday night, the 19 Senate Republicans gave in to the Democrats, and the\u00a0Senate passed H.R. 3684, the so-called infrastructure bill by a\u00a069-30 margin.\n\nInterestingly enough, Pelosi is putting\u00a0the vulnerable members at risk by calling them back. Still, Pelosi threatened many times that she would not take up the\u00a0infrastructure bill in the House until the Senate finishes the trojan horse-like\u00a0reconciliation package that costs trillions of dollars and is filled with many radical left agenda items.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Tuesday night said that the Senate would \u201cimmediately\u00a0move\u201d into crafting the\u00a0trojan horse-like\u00a0reconciliation package after the votes for the so-called infrastructure bill happened.",

    "body": "Republican Senator tells 'Hannity' why the Democrats proposed election reform bill is 'dangerous'\n\n\n\n\nGiven their shameful history of using donor disclosure to suppress the civil rights movement in the 1950s, the Democrats\u2019 recent decision to revive the practice in\u00a0H.R. 1\u00a0and use it to suppress contemporary dissenters is a bit surprising.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey\u2019re evidently hoping the American people will be too lazy to learn about how they abused donor disclosure in the past, and too na\u00efve to worry about how they might abuse it now or in the future.\u00a0\nSome of us haven\u2019t forgotten.\u00a0\nHANS VON SPAKOVSKY: HR1/FOR THE PEOPLE ACT IMPERILS FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. HERE ARE THE WORST 8 PARTS\nAfter decades of hard work, in the mid-1950s the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) finally began to win some significant victories in its long struggle to overturn the system of legally enforced racial discrimination known as Jim Crow. In response, the southern political establishment deployed a new and potent weapon: donor disclosure.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom Virginia to Florida and from North Carolina to Texas, Democratic state attorneys general and Democratic state lawmakers demanded that the civil rights organization divulge its supporters\u2019 names as a condition for operating within their states.\u202f\u00a0\nThey assumed many supporters would withdraw their support if doing so meant risking reprisals from segregationists, and they were right. Between 1955 and 1957, the civil rights organization\u2019s southern membership declined by more than 50%.\u00a0\nRather than allow the Democrats to run it out of the state, the NAACP\u2019s Alabama affiliate challenged the disclosure requirement in federal court, and in 1958 it won a decisive victory.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Alabama\u2019s disclosure law. Unfortunately, instead of finding that\u00a0the law\u00a0was unconstitutional on its face,\u00a0the court found it was unconstitutional as it applied to the NAACP in that particular case.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat narrow ruling is what gives today\u2019s Democrats their opening.\u00a0\nCiting the as-applied nature of the court\u2019s decision in\u00a0NAACP v. Alabama\u00a0as justification, the Democratic establishment has recently embarked on a full-blown revival of donor disclosure.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe free and unfettered flow of competing ideas is essential to the operation of our republican system of government.\nIn 2013, New York State\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began demanding the names of donors to nonprofits operating within the state. California\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Kamala Harris made a similar demand the following year.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast week\u00a0\u2013\u00a0on a party-line vote\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the Democrats in the U. S. House of Representatives approved H.R. 1, making donor disclosure a national requirement under federal law.\u00a0\nWhile the threat of disclosure tends to discourage donations to nonprofit organizations of all kinds, the chilling effect is particularly pronounced for organizations that espouse unpopular views on contentious issues.\u00a0\nIn today\u2019s highly polarized and censorious atmosphere, those who are known to support such organizations are subject to devastating forms of retaliation, including boycotts and protests for business owners and job losses and death threats for private individuals.\u00a0\u00a0\nRather than risk that kind of retaliation, many people will simply stop supporting controversial organizations. That makes donor disclosure attractive to entrenched political interests, but it also makes it extremely dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe free and unfettered flow of competing ideas is essential to the operation of our republican system of government and to the survival of our free and open society. That is why the First Amendment protects multiple forms of free expression\u00a0\u2013\u00a0not just freedom of speech and freedom of the press, but also the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nWe can exercise our expressive rights in person by speaking in public, by publishing our thoughts in printed form, by attending political meetings with other like-minded people, and by writing to and calling on our elected representatives. For most of us, however, it is far more efficient and effective to join with others in support of nonprofit organizations that speak and publish and advocate on our behalf.\u00a0\u00a0\nDonor disclosure laws are dangerous because they make people afraid to exercise their expressive rights in this highly efficient and effective way. That seems to be what today\u2019s Democrats want. For the good of the country, we must prove them wrong.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "body": "American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp engaged in a fiery debate Monday over voter identification laws with fellow Fox News contributor Chris Hahn.\n In an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Faulkner Focus,\u201d Schlapp and Hahn discussed the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and the 2022 midterm elections with guest host Martha MacCallum. But the conversation quickly devolved into a shouting match over whether there was a need to verify a voter\u2019s identity. (RELATED: Poll: Two-Thirds Of Republicans Believe Voter Fraud Helped Biden Win)\n      \u201cWell look, it\u2019s a redistricting year, and Republicans will do everything they can to gerrymander the seats they need,\u201d Hahn began. \u201cThey won\u2019t win because of ideas. They won\u2019t win because they\u2019ve done anything good. They won\u2019t win because they\u2019re going to be running on Trump\u2019s failed record. They\u2019re going to win because of partisan gerrymandering, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n MacCallum jumped in and said there was a \u201cfair amount\u201d of policy discussion at CPAC and that 2022 will be \u201ca battle over policy \u2026 a battle over ideas.\u201d\n \u201cThis question of gerrymandering is what majorities of both parties do to try to optimize the number of House seats. It\u2019s what is written into the Constitution,\u201d Schlapp responded. \u201cThe real question when it comes to all of this is H.R. 1, which is going through Congress, and that would actually undermine all these state election rules. It would nationalize our election process \u2026 It\u2019ll be our worst Democratic nightmare. No voter registration, no signature verification. We should not go there as a country.\u201d\n \n \u201cMore suppression is all you want,\u201d Hahn retorted.\n \u201cI want everyone to vote,\u201d Schlapp replied.\n \u201cAll Matt wants, and all conservatives want, is fewer people to vote. Because when a lot of people vote, Republicans with no policies do not win. So H.R. 1 needs to pass. So does the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2026 If the Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster to do it, they should,\u201d Hahn said.\n MacCallum then explained that the issue over voter verification \u201cis probably the most important issue in the 2022 elections.\u201d She told Hahn it \u201cshould be important to both parties,\u201d that a person can prove they are eligible to vote.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a real issue,\u201d Hahn said, interrupting MacCallum. \u201cThere\u2019s been study after study after study after study. Nobody is faking it to vote. That\u2019s something conservatives say when they whine to lose.\u201d\n MacCallum then questioned Hahn on why he should even be concerned if what he said is true. But before Hahn could respond, Schlapp cited a case of voter fraud committed by a Republican and said \u201cit can\u2019t just be voter fraud when a Republican does it.\u201d\n Hahn tried to cut off the fellow guest, but Schlapp raised his voice. \u201cLet me finish!\u201d he said, before arguing that both sides\u00a0should come together and \u201cdo everything possible to minimize\u201d instances of illegal voting.\n \u201cIt stands to reason that if you don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any issue, then you should be able to have voter verification across the board so that both sides can agree that there aren\u2019t any problems happening,\u201d MacCallum concluded.",

    "body": "May 1, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. GMT+2 Everyone knew Hispanics were at risk of being undercounted in the 2020 Census, because the Trump administration gave every indication of wanting them undercounted. The administration's hard-line anti-immigrant policies , after all, extended to the census. As commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross attempted to get a citizenship question added to the survey, but the effort was blocked by the Supreme Court. Still, election-data experts and advocacy groups warned that no matter what the outcome, the battle would have a chilling effect on response rates among Hispanics. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right The reapportionment numbers released this week seemed to confirm this fear. To be sure, nationally, census counts came in remarkably close to pre-census predictions . (Those predictions were made using birth and death records, data on international migration and Medicare records.) The total count, nearly 332 million, exceeded pre-census estimates by a mere 0.7 percent. That suggests a high degree of accuracy, especially considering the difficulties of counting under pandemic conditions. But the degree of accuracy was not the same everywhere. The greatest underperformance, relative to projections, occurred in three Sun Belt states \u2014 Texas, Florida and Arizona \u2014 where head counts fell short of projections by 177,000, 163,000 and 262,000, respectively. These three states also have some of the highest proportions of Hispanics in the country: 40 percent in Texas, 26 percent in Florida and 32 percent in Arizona. Given that two of those states, Texas and Florida, are red and Arizona is a closely divided purple state, Republicans did not do themselves any favors: Their actions may have suppressed census responses in places where they would benefit from more seats in Congress. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement That's because the consequences for congressional representation largely mirror the regional differences in the census results. Each of those three states received one fewer seat than had been expected from pre-census estimates: Texas gained only two seats, Florida gained one seat, and Arizona gained none . As a result, these three states will send fewer members than expected to the House \u2014 and have fewer electoral votes for the presidency. Other evidence suggests the Trump administration efforts had a suppressing effect: Two other states that are more than one-fifth Hispanic, Colorado and Nevada, were also among the worst seven states when it comes to number of people missed by the census. Trump's push to skew the census builds on a long history of politicizing the count There were more factors at play in the undercounts than Trump administration hostility, however. Arizona was undercounted by over 262,000 people, or 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, neighboring New Mexico, which is 49 percent Hispanic, reported nearly 14,000 more people than pre-census estimates, a slight overcount of 0.7 percent, a figure in line with the national overcount average. And California, which is 39 percent Hispanic, likewise reported an 0.5 percent overcount. What accounts for the different outcomes? Those states invested in the census as a matter of self-interest. New Mexico spent nearly $12 million on outreach efforts, and California invested a whopping $187 million . The investment will pay off, since many federal benefits are based on census population. And although California lost a House seat for the first time ever, its high-quality count forestalled a potential loss of an additional congressional seat. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Meanwhile, Arizona and Florida spent no money at all on outreach, and Texas's efforts were limited to a last-minute ad campaign . Costly outreach is anathema to the small-government attitude of Republicans, an especially unfortunate stance when so many Republican-leaning states have low population density and may be harder to count. But reapportioned seats are not the end of the story. All states now face the ultimate translation of population growth into power \u2014 namely, redistricting , which will start in the fall. Redistricting has even higher stakes than reapportionment, because a gerrymander can assign power in a lopsided manner no matter what the political leanings of the citizens. For example, in the 2010 Census cycle, Texas gained four congressional seats, driven in large part by Hispanic growth, yet no Hispanic members were added to the congressional delegation, because districts were redrawn to diminish their power. Both Democrats and Republicans have it in their reach to prevent a recurrence of this harm. The Democratic incentive is obvious: Latinos lean toward that party. Democrats in Congress can reintroduce H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which passed the last session of the House before dying in the Senate. H.R. 4 would restore the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 \u2014 that mandate the review of new election laws in states that have a poor history of voting rights. That includes redistricting, and the list of scrutinized states formerly included Texas and Florida. Passage of H.R. 4 would potentially hold back a racial gerrymander that once again disenfranchises Hispanics. The last time the Voting Rights Act was renewed, in 2006, it passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities; granted, the odds are much stiffer now, but principle demands that it be given a hearing. Trump lied to the Supreme Court. His new census order proves it. It's also not out of the question that Republicans could revise their thinking about Hispanic voters given that in several parts of the country \u2014 including southwestern Texas and southern Florida \u2014 substantial numbers of them shifted to President Donald Trump last November. If Republicans want to demonstrate to Hispanic voters that they aren't interested in disempowering them \u2014 and in fact plan to compete for their votes \u2014 they could take steps that compensate for the census undercount. State-districting rules allow legislators to draw slightly underpopulated legislative districts, a move that, of course, enhances the power of each voter in such a district. By doing this in districts rich in Hispanics, Republicans would signal that they, too, want to be a multiracial party. Doing so could start to rewrite today's national narrative linking race and party. Hispanics appear to have been undercounted in several key states, but the battle isn't over yet. The redistricting fights ahead may yet give them seats at the congressional table.",

The ADPPA, introduced in the last Congressional session, sought to replace California's landmark law with weaker protections and could compromise the ability of the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) to fulfill its mandate to protect the privacy of Californians. California today calls on Congress to set the floor and not the ceiling in any federal privacy law, and to allow states to provide additional protections in response to changing technology and data privacy protection practices.\n  \"National data privacy laws passed by Congress should strengthen, not weaken our existing laws here in California,\" said Governor Newsom. \"As personal data is routinely bought and sold it is critical that consumers have the ability to consent to the sharing of this information, especially in an era where Roe v.

The measure, they said:\n\nHouse Democrats have also pointed to their intention of pursuing gun control measures, with\u00a0House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) referring to the current effort as merely a \u201cfirst step.\u201d\n\nFar-left Democrats are also pursuing enacting a $15 minimum wage, as well as a series of immigration bills, which has put some moderate Democrats out of ease.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t say, \u2018Yeah, yeah, let everybody in\u2019 \u2014 because then\u00a0we\u2019re\u00a0affected down there at the border,\u201d Rep.

And I believe they\u2019re repugnant to the vast majority of the American citizenry, and as such, 2022 ought to be a landslide year for Republicans in the House and in the Senate,\u201d he predicted, expressing hope that the momentum would carry into 2024.\n\n\u201cWe [Republicans] just need to let the Democrats do what they\u2019re doing, publicize what they\u2019re doing, fight it, and defeat it when we can, and make sure the public understands how egregious and how radical the socialist Democrat policies are,\u201d he added.",

    "body": "\u201cI think that they can still get it done, but it may have to be done on a scale that's smaller than we would have hoped,\u201d said Dan Adcock, the government relations and policy director at the liberal National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. \u201cI think this is something that, at least in the advocacy community, people had anticipated this and know that this was going to be a likely outcome. I think there's still going to be a bill, but it may not be as ambitious as we would have liked.\u201dDemocrats want to pass the bill using the budget reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes in the Senate. But with the Senate divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, there are no votes to spare.DEL RIO BRIDGE SHANTYTOWN COULD RESULT IN COVID-19 OUTBREAKSen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has been pushing a provision in the bill to add dental, vision, and hearing benefits to Medicare. Other Democrats, many from Southern states, are pushing for the federal government to cover the roughly 4.4 million poor people from the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.The American Rescue Plan passed by Congress in March included $36 billion to expand for two years of subsidies for insurance premiums on Obamacare exchanges. Democrats are hoping to extend those subsidies for another 10 years in the spending package.The total cost of these expansions over 10 years is about $600 billion.But centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have balked at the spending bill. Manchin has suggested that Congress take a \u201cstrategic pause\u201d on the legislation until possibly 2022, and Sinema has said she could not support spending $3.5 trillion.Reducing the amount spent on the overall bill would also mean reducing spending on the healthcare provisions. The resistance of Manchin and Sinema are not the only threats to these healthcare proposals. Much of the funding to pay for it was supposed to come from H.R. 3, \u201cThe Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act,\u201d which would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate on prescription drugs for the first time. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this was supposed to save the federal government over $450 billion over 10 years. Whether that bill will pass the House seems increasingly unlikely. The House Ways and Means Committee passed the bill last week, but it failed to clear the Energy and Commerce Committee, where four centrist Democrats opposed it. Back in May, 10 Democrats signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing reservations about the bill. Democrats have 220 members in the House to the GOP\u2019s 212, which means that they can afford only three defections if they are to pass H.R. 3. \u201cThe Democratic leadership has a couple of options,\u201d said Doug Badger, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cFirst, they could pressure moderates who opposed the price control provision in committee to back passage on the floor. More likely, they will try to cobble together a price control package that gives them less savings and scale back the other expansions.\u201d Badger suggested that Democrats would most likely scale back the Obamacare subsidies, extending for them for only three or four years. \u201cDemocrats will be betting that a future Congress won't let the program expire,\u201d Badger said. Adcock thought it would be possible for Democrats to come up with most of the money for the healthcare proposals by finding it in other parts of the spending bill. Yet, that would require eliminating other spending proposals in the bill. He conceded that it would be \u201ca monumental task in terms of negotiation.\u201d Another possibility is that Democrats remove these provisions from the spending bill and vote on them later as stand-alone bills. But the chances of that seem remote. \u201cIt's possible, but [Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer] is generally reluctant to bring a bill to the floor that would be open to amendment and debate. He would need an ironclad commitment from 10 GOP senators to prevent amendment and debate,\u201d said Badger. Adcock also thought it was unlikely. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \u201cI think it still would have to be done under budget reconciliation because I think it's unlikely that Democrats would get Republicans to vote for those kind of benefit improvements,\u201d said Adcock.

    "body": "H.R. 5376, passed by the House of Representatives last month but currently stalled in the Senate, provides $390 billion for child care and universal pre-K with a substantial portion reserved for states to distribute. Part of the bill requires, however, that money not go towards facilities that \"are used primarily for sectarian instruction or religious worship.\"  Other provisions include potentially problematic nondiscrimination restrictions. They also risk forcing providers out of state-based universal pre-K programs, according to a letter multiple religious organizations sent to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP) on Dec. 1.  HEY, JOE BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS, LEAVE OUR KIDS AND CHILD CARE ALONE  \"While language in the BBBA [Build Back Better Act] does not preclude parents from selecting sectarian providers, the subsequent provisions in the bill text make it virtually impossible for many religious providers to participate,\" read the letter, which was signed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, among others.  While it's unclear exactly how the legislative language will be applied, the letter pointed to a poll showing a substantial chunk of American families use child care centers \"affiliated with a faith organization.\"  The poll, which was conducted by Morning Consult and the Bipartisan Policy Center, found : \"In January 2020, 31% of households with a single parent or two working parents used center-based care, and over half (53%) of these families used one that was affiliated with a faith organization.\"  The office for HELP Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.  The Biden White House has defended its child care initiative, saying: \"The Build Back Better framework will enable states to expand access to free preschool for more than 6 million children per year and increase the quality of preschool for many more children already enrolled. Importantly, parents will be able to send children to high-quality preschool in the setting of their choice \u2014 from public schools to child care providers to Head Start. The program will lead to lifelong educational and economic benefits for children and parents, and is a transformational investment in America\u2019s future economic competitiveness.\"",

Can you imagine not having to sit down, where there\u2019s no reason for you to sit down, with your colleagues on both sides and have their input?\u201d Manchin responded.\n He explained that the \u201cSenate is the most unique body of government in the world\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s basically designed to make sure the minority has input.\u201d He added that he\u2019s willing to look at things \u201canyway we can,\u201d but that he\u2019s \u201cnot willing to take away the involvement of the minority.\u201d\n \n Todd then told Manchin that he \u201cdidn\u2019t directly answer\u201d his question on a \u201creconciliation route for election-only bills like H.R. 1.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not willing to go into reconciliation until we \u2026 allow the Senate to do its job. Just by assuming that, \u2018hey, they\u2019ll never work with us, that\u2019s the other side, this is tribal, Republicans will never agree on anything, or Democrats will never agree,\u2019 I don\u2019t subscribe to that,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to go to reconciliation until the other process has failed. That means the normal process of a committee, a hearing, amendments, Chuck, and that\u2019s where I am.\u201d\n Todd followed up, saying it sounded like Manchin would change his mind if \u201cRepublicans continue to be unified in opposition.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to change my mind on the filibuster. I\u2019ll change my mind if we need to go to a reconciliation, to where we have to get something done, once I know they have process into it. I\u2019m not going to go there until my Republican friends have the ability to have their say, also,\u201d Manchin answered.\n \u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll get involved to the point to where we have 10 of them that will work with 50 of us, or 15 of them that will work with 45 of us \u2026 I\u2019m for that,\u201d he concluded.\n Senate Democrats have floated the idea of getting rid of the filibuster rule, which would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority, rather than a 60-vote majority. In addition to Manchin, Democratic Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema also expressed her opposition to scrapping the rule.\n The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, also known as the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d on Mar. 4. It largely includes legislation involving federal election laws. Many Republicans, and others, have expressed concern over the contents of the bill. It will now head to the Senate, and is expected to face opposition from Senate Republicans.",

    "body": "The bill, the Private Loan Disability Discharge Act (H.R. 2498), would require private student loan lenders to discharge the loan balance for both the student loan borrower and any co-signer if the borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled.Currently, there is a federal Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge program that allows borrowers to discharge their federal student loans on the basis of a medical impairment. But there is no such program for private student loan borrowers. Some private lenders do offer a disability discharge in certain circumstances, but such programs are discretionary, and availability of these private student loan disability discharge options is uneven at best. Furthermore, even when these programs are offered and a discharge is granted, the cosigner may still be responsible for repaying the student loan, even if the borrower is released from their obligation.\u201cA constituent brought this issue to our attention... her daughter had become totally disabled and she was left with the remaining balance of her private student loans as the cosigner, \u201d said Rep. Madeleine Dean (PA-04) in a statement. \u201cThe lending company said they would forgive the loan for the borrower, but not for the cosigner \u2013 so we wrote H.R. 2498 to address this unfair practice, and to ensure student loan borrowers are protected in the case of these terrible circumstances.\"The new bill comes amidst increasing attention to student loan discharges for disabled student loan borrowers. Yesterday, student loan advocacy organizations filed a formal petition calling on the Biden administration to grant automatic student loan forgiveness to hundreds of thousands of disabled borrowers who may be entitled to a discharge of their federal student loans under the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge program, but may not even realize that they qualify. The organizations have urged the U.S. Department of Education to automatically cancel these borrowers\u2019 federal student loans, without requiring them to affirmatively apply, given that the Social Security Administration has already shared sufficient information with Department officials regarding eligible disabled borrowers.Last month, the Biden administration announced that it would be rolling back paperwork requirements for the federal TPD discharge program by temporarily waiving borrowers\u2019 obligations during the so-called post-discharge monitoring period, which lasts for three years. To keep their forgiven student loans in a discharged status, most TPD borrowers must submit ongoing annual paperwork following discharge approval to certify their disabled status and employment earnings (if any). Failure to respond can result in a reversal of the discharge and reinstatement of the student loans. The vast majority of student loan disability discharges that get reversed are due to a disabled borrower\u2019s failure to respond to monitoring requests and submit the required paperwork. The Biden administration\u2019s waiver of the TPD post-discharge monitoring requirement will be retroactive to March of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic emergency was first declared, and will continue until the emergency is over.Further Reading400,000 Borrowers May Qualify For Student Loan Forgiveness And Not Even Know ItNew Details: Student Loan Forgiveness Could Wipe Out The Debt Of Most BorrowersBiden Excludes Student Loan Forgiveness From Budget Proposal, But Calls For More Funding For Higher Ed: Key DetailsKey Moments From Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Blockbuster Hearing On Student Loans4 Key Questions About Biden\u2019s Student Loan Forgiveness ReviewBiden To Initiate Additional Student Loan Relief This Week \u2014 But Borrowers Demand Full Cancellation72,000 Borrowers Will Get $1 Billion In Student Loan Forgiveness - Do You Qualify?Is $10,000 In Student Loan Forgiveness Next, After Biden Administration Cancels $1 Billion?Senate Passes Stimulus Bill With Student Loan Tax Relief \u2014 Will It \u201cPave The Way\u201d To Cancel Student Debt?Here\u2019s Everyone Who Wants Biden To Cancel Student Loan Debt (It\u2019s A Big List)Whether Biden Cancels Student Debt Will Depend On These 3 ThingsCould These Student Loan Borrowers Be Excluded From Biden\u2019s Forgiveness?",

This is an existential struggle over what type of world we want to live in,\" Gallagher told a separate news briefing on Tuesday morning.\n  Leading up to the hearing, Gallagher held several events to draw attention to rights concerns, including a rally on Saturday outside what U.S. officials call an illegal Chinese Communist Party \"police station\" in New York.\n  Gallagher sent a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week seeking information about such alleged police outposts. He said Monday he had not received a response, but expected FBI director Christopher Wray would brief the panel.\n  China denies operating \"police stations\" on U.S. soil.\n  FOUR WITNESSES\n  Tuesday's hearing, set for 7 p.m. EST (0100 GMT), will have four witnesses, including H.R. McMaster, a retired Army lieutenant general who was former Republican President Donald Trump's national security adviser, and Matt Pottinger, a long-time China hawk who was deputy national security adviser to Trump.",

It would ensure that parents are able to return to the workplace. It would help combat the ongoing youth mental health crisis spurred by school closures. My bill, the Reopen Schools Act, would condition federal covid grants to schools on those schools actually being open and operating in the first place which is what that money was intended to do. So many students are still trapped behind screens. And what about the students who don\u2019t have regular computer and broadband internet access? What about students in households without computers or even households with only one computer where mom and dad are maybe trying to also use it for work? Virtual learning means we are leaving behind our most vulnerable students, our rural students, our students with additional learning challenges. And even kids who have every virtual advantage are struggling.\n\nShe added, \u201cFamilies are struggling.

March for Our Lives , an activist group founded after the 2018 Parkland, Florida, school shooting, will hold marches across the U.S. on June 11. The march in Washington, D.C., is set to take place from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. that day, Florida's Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported  Zeenat Yahya, the group's policy director, said March for Our Lives looks to \u201cflood\u201d politicians' offices in the days leading up to this year's march, according to the newspaper.  One of the group's goals is to pass gun control legislation, such as H.R. 8, which mandates universal background checks ahead of gun sales . The bill was recently the subject of an emotional press conference speech by Golden State Warriors' coach Steve Kerr.  March for Our Lives is encouraging others to sign petitions, contact politicians, vote and participate in the demonstrations. The group has also called on Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring the bill to a vote in the Senate; however, such a move is unlikely in the next two weeks due to lawmakers' pre-planned trips and breaks.  Serena Rodrigues, a national coordinator for the group, said its members are heartbroken for the victims of Tuesday's school shooting, Florida news outlet WPBF reported  \u201cYou put a target on our backs and this is a preventable tragedy,\u201d Rodrigues said. \u201cThe regular mass murder of students and kids like this, it's so normal in America.

Hogan said she and her sister, Tanya Castro, have chosen to be his voice and advocate for a ban on assault weapons since he cannot speak for himself.\n\nThe sisters told ABC News if it takes marching and talking to politicians to prevent another family from being affected by a mass shooting carried out by an assault weapon, that's what they will do.\n\n\"These type of things shouldn't be happening. It's just like every month you hear about something going on\u2026 you have to put a stop to it\u2026there has to be a change, you know, because families shouldn't have to go through what we're going through,\" Hogan said.\n\nWhen it gets tough, they're able to find comfort through fellow shooting victims' family members that advocate alongside them, they said.\n\n\"It feels like we're with people that know\u2026 that understand us\u2026that really understand us, because they've been through it. They lost someone. There's a connection. It kind of feels like you get an extended family,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe sisters added that knowing other loved ones who have experienced guilt helps them heal and feel less alone.\n\nJazmin Cazares, sister to 10-year-old Uvalde shooting victim Jacklyn Cazares, said people don't seem to understand the guilt she feels \"for even waking up in the morning, let alone having fun,\" but finds purpose in advocacy.\n\nShe told ABC News that families like her own now find themselves in \"a club that no one wants to be a part of.\"\n\nHer father, Javier Cazares, rallied alongside Jazmin, and reflected on the gathering of families.\n\n\"Now more than ever we have more families of different shootings. We're a coalition of people from Vegas to everywhere else,\" Javier Cazares told ABC News.\n\nHe added, \"We're getting bigger and bigger unfortunately for the same reason\u2014our kids lost. At first you hear us one by one, and now you hear all the voices coming together and it's very powerful.\"\n\nSurvivors from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newton, Connecticut, who are now seniors in high school, came with the Junior Newtown Action Alliance and urged Senators to pass the assault weapons ban.\n\n\"Congress should've banned these weapons of war after Sandy Hook,\" Leah Crebbin, co-chair of the Junior Newton Action Alliance, said to the crowd. \"The acts of terror and atrocities that have been committed will continue to occur if Senators stand by and do nothing.\"\n\nRep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., who authored H.R. 1808, told ABC News via email: \"It is always so inspiring to see groups like the one who gathered on Capitol Hill today, though I wish they didn't need to be here. Families shouldn't be forced to demand that their representatives do their jobs and act to keep their communities safe.\"",

    "body": "The economy could already be in a recession, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in a Thursday letter sent to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\nThe CBO\u2019s letter is a response to a handful of questions Graham, the Senate\u2019s Budget Committee\u2019s ranking member, had asked the CBO following a cost estimate report they released Wednesday for H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, according to the letter\u2019s text. One of Graham\u2019s prime concerns was whether the economy had already entered a recession, to which the CBO replied that it was too early to tell, though certainly plausible that the economy was in a recession.\n \u201cThe U.S. economy shows signs of slowing, but whether the economy is currently in a recession is difficult to say,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cIt is possible that, in retrospect, it will become apparent that the economy moved into recession sometime this year.\u201d\n  \n While many are familiar with the shorthand definition of recession being two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, the organization that classifies when a recession has begun, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), does so conservatively and retroactively by looking at a number of different indicators ranging from employment data, to consumption, investment, and more, according to the Bureau\u2019s website.\n \u201cThe committee\u2019s approach to determining the dates of turning points is retrospective. In making its peak and trough announcements, it waits until sufficient data are available to avoid the need for major revisions to the business cycle chronology. In determining the date of a peak in activity, it waits until it is confident that a recession has occurred,\u201d the NBER website states.\n  While some metrics certainly indicate a decline in economic activity in the first half of 2022, there is not yet an overwhelming preponderance of evidence to suggest that the economy is in a recession since factors like a strong labor market cloud the economic outlook, according to the CBO\u2019s letter.\n President Joe Biden has caught flack from critics for playing semantic games about whether the economy is technically in a recession when many Americans are hurting financially.\n Graham\u2019s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "body": "They must decide whether to publicly challenge these cynical measures, which are predicated on the patently false assertion that the 2020 election was riddled with fraud or remain on the sidelines in an attempt to avoid a politically contentious fight. This has quickly emerged as a fundamental test of corporate leadership in the public square.Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon exemplified leadership when he declared, \u201cWe regularly encourage our employees to exercise their fundamental right to vote, and we stand against efforts that may prevent them from being able to do so.\u201d. Last Wednesday, 72 Black business leaders, led by former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, spoke out forcefully against voter suppression measures now being pushed in a majority of states. They explicitly condemned a recently adopted Georgia law that will restrict absentee voting, impose added voter-identification requirements, and give the Republican-controlled legislature greater control over the election process\u2014a law clearly aimed at discouraging minority voters. They urged other corporate leaders to \u201cpublicly oppose any discriminatory legislation and all measures designed to limit Americans\u2019 ability to vote.\u201dNow, the spotlight has shifted to Texas, where an even more draconian law passed the State Senate and a similar bill is being considered in the House in coming days. Among its many troubling features, this legislation would impose limits on early voting, ban drive-through voting, and create new barriers to absentee and mail-in voting. Business leaders in Texas and elsewhere will be judged by their customers on whether they stand publicly against these anti-democratic proposals.In deciding whether and when to speak up in opposition to the Texas legislation, CEOs will need to consider a lesson learned from Georgia. In the run-up to the vote in Georgia, major companies based in the state, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, issued tepid statements of concern, in effect hedging their bets and hoping the public controversy would fade. Only in the aftermath of the law\u2019s adoption, and after they were harshly criticized for their silence, did Coca-Cola and Delta register their disapproval, too late to affect the outcome. Proving that straddling the fence on these issues pleases no one, the Georgia-based companies are now being attacked by Governor Brian Kemp and others for speaking out at all.In Texas and other states where voter suppression bills are now under consideration, corporate leaders need to take a stand publicly in opposition to specific bills and do so clearly and in a timely manner. Quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke about the \u201cfierce urgency of now,\u201d Chenault, Frazier, and their group made clear to other corporate leaders that they need to speak up now. As the Black business leaders rightly observed, \u201cThe stakes for our democracy are too high to remain on the sidelines. Corporate America must support our nation\u2019s fundamental democratic principles and marshal its collective influence to ensure fairness and equity for all.\u201dA number of leading businesses have announced their support for H.R. 1, the federal legislative proposal that would override many of the restrictive measures now being proposed in the states. If enacted H.R. 1 would open up voting procedures nationwide, but its chances of adoption in the U.S. Senate are far from certain. As the debate on H.R. 1 unfolds in Washington, companies also need to focus on a state-by-state level on efforts to undermine voting protections.Last week, several influential companies have stepped up publicly to criticize the Texas legislation, including American Airlines, Dell, and Microsoft. Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of the computer manufacturer, tweeted : \u201cFree, fair, equitable access to voting is the foundation of American democracy. Those rights \u2014 especially for women, communities of color \u2014 have been hard-earned. Governments should ensure citizens have their voices heard. H.B. 6, [the voting-restriction bill], does the opposite, and we are opposed to it.\u201dUnfortunately, the legislative measures in Georgia and Texas are not isolated initiatives, but part of a national effort. In a new report from the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, legislators in 47 states have introduced 361 bills aimed at restricting voting. Five bills have already become law, and 55 others in 24 states are moving through state legislatures.The rationale for these measures is the false premise that Joseph Biden\u2019s election in November was the product of massive voter fraud, a claim that has been decisively rejected by election officials in all 50 states, and overwhelmingly dismissed in the courts. In fact, the 2020 election was a remarkable affirmation of democratic participation in our country. Despite a once-in-a-century pandemic, a record number of people voted, shattering levels of participation for both political parties.In 2020, former president Trump received more than 74 million votes \u2014 11 million more than he received in 2016 and more than any other Republican candidate has ever received. President Biden received 81 million votes, also 11 million more votes than any other Democratic president in history. Almost two-thirds of eligible voters participated, the highest rate in nearly a century. An important factor contributing to this increase was the dramatic steps many states took to expand mail balloting and early voting in response to the pandemic. This is the time to reinforce those gains, not to roll them back.American corporations have been great beneficiaries of our two-century-old democratic experiment. Democracy and the rule of law have allowed commerce to thrive. In the coming weeks and months, in Texas and elsewhere, American business leaders will be called on to stand up for democracy and for the ability of every American to exercise this most precious right \u2014 the right to vote. Last week, a coalition of more than 190 corporate leaders, including the heads of Dow, Under Armor, Bain & Company, and HP, did just that, joining the Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan business group that supports greater civic engagement. In a strong public statement, they weighed in against proposed legislation that is \u201cthreatening to make voting more difficult in dozens of states nationwide.\u201d. This is a moment for other corporate leaders to join this effort and make their voices heard.",

Susan Collins, R-Maine, would prohibit the federal government from selling SPR stocks to China and other countries of particular concern. Earlier this month, the House passed similar legislation, the Protecting America\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act, by a margin of 331-97.\n\n\"China is profiting from President Biden\u2019s political abuse of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,\" Barrasso said in a statement. \"Meanwhile, America has become more vulnerable to true energy and national security emergencies.\"\n\n\"Our legislation will ban SPR sales to China and other hostile nations,\" he continued. \"It will also ban SPR sales to state-owned companies which purchase oil from Russia, Iran, and other nations the U.S. has sanctioned. Adversaries cannot be allowed to benefit from America\u2019s security reserve.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS PLAN OVERSIGHT INTO HOW BIDEN ADMIN'S GREEN PUSH BENEFITS CHINA: 'NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE'\n\nCollins added that it is \"inexcusable that our emergency stockpile of crude oil is being sold to dictators overseas.\" She said legislation was necessary to ensure Americans primarily benefit from future SPR releases.\n\nOver the summer, the Biden administration was heavily criticized after reports that it had sold SPR oil to China which reportedly used the stocks to bolster its own reserves. The White House then fired back, saying it was legally required to sell the oil to the highest bidder.\n\nBIDEN DRAGGED FOR TOUTING GAS PRICE DROP AS AMERICANS STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET: 'WHAT PLANET ARE YOU ON?'\n\nThe second legislation Senate Republicans introduced Tuesday, the Strategic Production Response Act, would require the Department of Energy to only tap the SPR when there is a severe energy supply interruption and not until the Interior Department issues a plan to increase oil and gas production on federal lands and waters.\n\n\"America is stronger and safer when we are energy independent,\" Barrasso stated. \"The Biden administration agenda is to choke off energy development on federal land. Our legislation will prevent President Biden from raiding the SPR for political purposes without boosting American oil production.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s time to work together to lower prices for Wyoming families, unleash American energy, and strengthen our national security,\" the Wyoming Republican added.\n\nBarrasso introduced the bill alongside Sens. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Steve Daines, R-Mont., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, John Hoeven, R-N.D., James Lankford, R-Okla., Bill Cassidy, R-La., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss.\n\nThe bill is companion legislation to a bill with the same name introduced in the House by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and which is slated for a floor vote this week. However, Democrats and the White House have taken aim at the House bill, saying it would lead to higher prices.\n\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR UNVEILS BILLS TARGETING BIDEN'S CLIMATE AGENDA: 'ENERGY IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY'\n\n\"We believe that there is room for bipartisanship to expand our ability to create more affordable, reliable energy in America,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters Monday. \"But proposals like H.R. 21, which risks raising these gas prices and making it offer to \u2014 harder to offer Americans relief in the future are simply nonstarters.\"\n\n\"So I\u2019ll be very clear: If Congress were to pass H.R. 21, the President would veto it,\" Granholm said. \"He will not allow the American people to suffer because of the backwards agenda that House Republicans are advancing.\"\n\nOverall, Biden has ordered the Department of Energy to release a total of about 260 million barrels of oil stored in the SPR since taking office to combat record fuel prices hitting American consumers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the SPR's level has fallen to about 371.6 million barrels of oil, the lowest level since 1983, according to Energy Information Administration data. The current level is also nearly 40% lower than its level recorded days prior to Biden's first release in late November.\n\nThe SPR was established by the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act to help the U.S. mitigate the impacts of future \"severe energy supply interruptions.\"",

    "body": "Content loading... Democrats plan to introduce legislation in the House and Senate on Tuesday to combat new laws in Republican-run states that could lead to the subversion of fair elections by partisan officials. The new bills come in response to measures passed by Republican-majority state legislatures and signed into law by Republican governors that make it easier for partisan legislatures to purge state election boards and local election supervisors and replace them without cause with partisan officials. These state laws follow former President Donald Trump 's pressure campaign against state and local election officials to overturn his 2020 reelection loss based on false claims of widespread voter fraud. The anti-election bills will institute a new federal safeguard for local election supervisors or superintendents by forbidding their removal by partisan state election boards or legislatures for any reason other than \u201cfor cause.\u201d Recent election subversion laws enacted at the state level by Republicans have allowed removal for no reason at all. The new measures introduced by Democrats will also provide a \u201cfor cause\u201d standard. Local and county election officials subject to removal by a state election board or other entity will also be allowed under the Democratic bill to move that process to a federal court. The bills will also make it a federal crime to intimidate, threaten, coerce or harass election workers, or to attempt to do so. They will also require poll observers to maintain a minimum distance from any voter or ballot during early voting and on an election day. This push to counter election subversion comes alongside the efforts by congressional Democrats to pass the For the People Act, a sweeping package of voting rights, campaign finance, redistricting and ethics reforms, also known as H.R. 1. The For the People Act, which passed the House in May, faces its first test in the Senate on Tuesday afternoon when it is expected to face a Republican filibuster. The election subversion bills are being introduced as standalone legislation by Reps. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Nikema Williams (D-Ga.) and Colin Allred (D-Texas) in the House and Sens. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in the Senate. The intention is to make these bills part of the For the People Act in an amendment when the bill is brought to the Senate floor again. \u201cRepublicans across the country continue to invent new tricks to give themselves control over our elections,\u201d Williams said in a statement. \u201cTheir latest efforts seek to remove protections for the non-partisan election officials who ensure the integrity of our democracy. Protecting election officials from partisan interference is one way Congress can secure free and fair elections for everyone, no matter their zip code. I am proud to co-lead this bill with House and Senate leaders because it shows that Congress is ready to respond in real time to any threat to our democracy. As we continue to strengthen H.R. 1, this will not be the last discussion we have about how to prevent further attempts to subvert our elections.\u201d The anti-election subversion bills come as state-level Republicans are using their newfound powers to remove local election officials for no stated cause. Of the 10 local officials removed so far in Georgia, five are Black and most are Democrats, according to The New York Times . They are all likely to be replaced by Republicans. States including Arizona and Texas are considering similar election subversion legislation. The officials being removed are in charge of selecting precinct locations; notifying voters of these locations, election times and rules; setting early voting hours; and, most important, certifying elections. Partisans installed into these positions could limit polling locations, place them in inconvenient locations, limit early voting hours and days, fail to notify voters of their precinct locations and, as Trump wanted in 2020, refuse to certify an election result. This risk of election subversion by partisan officials emerged as a new threat after the 2020 elections when Trump and the Republican Party tried to overturn the result. Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn Georgia's election result. Raffensperger refused. The Republican state legislature responded by stripping him of his election oversight authority, and Trump endorsed a primary challenger who had supported overturning the 2020 election for him. In Michigan, two local Republican election officials nearly refused to certify the election results in Wayne County, the home of Detroit. These officials were white and the county is predominantly Black. They certified the election after pressure from local voters. These efforts to overturn the election eventually snowballed into the Jan. 6 insurrection Trump led against Congress to try to stop it from certifying President Joe Biden's 303-232 win in the Electoral College.",

    "body": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is scared to death that he's right. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right McConnell is particularly worried that Democrats will use their majorities in the House and Senate to enact fundamental reforms to our political system, from protecting voting rights to containing dark money's influence on elections. That's why the man who supposedly loves Congress's upper chamber promised to create \u201c a completely scorched earth Senate \u201d if Democrats try to make it easier to pass legislation. Biden warming up to the idea of making the filibuster much harder to use is big news, given his reluctance to take this step in the past. He's responding to reality. As the president told ABC News's George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday: \u201cIt's getting to the point where, you know, democracy is having a hard time functioning.\u201d Exactly. The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, made it clear where things are headed when he declared on Monday that the filibuster was \u201c making a mockery of American democracy .\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said in an interview that it is becoming ever more obvious that Republican abuse of the filibuster \u201cis a direct threat to President Biden's effort to pass his ambitious agenda.\u201d Biden is a well-known Senate institutionalist. He practically grew up in the Senate, having arrived shortly after his 30th birthday . He thus has more standing than just about anyone to persuade the filibuster's staunchest Democratic supporters, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, of two things. First, the time for major new restraints on the filibuster has come; second, and just as important, that the current abuse of the filibuster flies in the face of authentic Senate tradition. Adam Jentleson is a former top Senate Democratic aide and the author of \u201c Kill Switch ,\u201d an appropriately titled book on the chamber. He offered a brisk history of the filibuster in an interview. The 60-vote standard for passing most legislation is really the product of the past 20 years, Jentleson said, and has been truly routine only since 2007. At the beginning of the republic, he noted, \u201cthere was no filibuster.\u201d Then, \u201cthere was the talking filibuster, used rarely, mostly against civil rights. Then there was a slow rise [in its use] through the latter half of the 20th century, then it skyrocketed under Sen. McConnell,\u201d Jentleson said to me in an interview. Little wonder, as the author noted, that the word filibuster comes from Dutch references to pirates Biden underscored the history in his ABC interview, noting that when he first arrived in the Senate, stalling action required its members \u201cto stand up and command the floor, and you had to keep talking.\u201d And changing filibuster rules would be nothing new. McConnell himself instituted the most recent shift. Eager to guarantee a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, the narrow Republican majority voted to remove the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmations. Not one of President Donald Trump's three nominees \u2014 not one \u2014 got close to 60 votes . When it came to court-packing, McConnell had no problem with majority rule. Biden made his comments on the filibuster on Tuesday, the eve of the formal Senate introduction of the For the People Act that has already passed the House. The comprehensive political reform bill would block the scandalous attack on voting rights in some Republican states. It would also curb gerrymanders that distort representation, take major steps to limit the power of dark money by expanding disclosure and create strong incentives for politicians to rely on small as opposed to large contributions. The illogic bred by the filibuster mentality is brought home by a now popular, but deeply flawed turn in political commentary that would instruct Democrats to jettison all the other reforms in the bill to pass at least a voting rights measure. But absolutely no one believes that Republicans will provide enough votes to overcome a filibuster on a voting rights bill. Thus, it would be legislative malpractice for Democrats to walk away from a broadly popular (and much needed) suite of improvements to our political system when doing so won't get them to 60 votes anyway. Moving away from the filibuster will take time. Change is likely to be gradual, not sudden. The Senate might have to start with narrower reforms (including Biden's \u201ctalking filibuster\u201d) before it becomes inescapable that legislating will require getting rid of the filibuster entirely for whole categories of bills. Of course, the alternative is for Republicans to become a more moderate, less monolithic party and to work constructively with Biden on major legislation.

Still, Democrats want to send a unified message to contrast against their colleagues' likely unanimous opposition to the bill.Manchin told reporters Monday evening that he needs assurances that his ideas would be adopted into the bill before he commits to supporting it.\"I hope they make some changes, agree with some changes,\" he said. \"We put out an awful lot of changes that hopefully the country will agree with.\"The senator's proposed compromise bill zeroes in on tackling partisan gerrymandering and bolstering early voting, while abandoning other provisions including the regulation of campaign finance systems and ethics rules for candidates.The roughly 800-page H.R.1 legislation passed in the House largely along party lines in March. It contains measures that will make voting easier, make campaign financing more transparent, and improve government ethics.Democrats describe their expansive proposals as anti-corruption legislation that would ramp up voting rights and counter GOP efforts at the state and local level to limit voting access. Republicans have strongly opposed the bill, calling it a Democratic power grab.Democratic leaders tried and failed to nail down Manchin's support over the weekend. Schumer said on Sunday, \"As we speak, we are working to come up with an agreement to compromise with Joe Manchin.\"Manchin reportedly met with President Joe Biden in the White House earlier today to continue election reform talks, during which the president expressed optimism at theSenate 's ability to find a way to pass the measure.Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin on Monday afternoon revealed he \"didn't know\" how Manchin would vote but said he hopes the senator will \"move forward.\"GOP lawmakers across 48 states have introduced nearly 400 bills to restrict voting. Critics allege that GOP members are attempting to make participation in elections harder for Democratic voters. The For the People Act would enforce federal uniform voting laws across the country.While there's a path to reaching 50 votes, with Manchin, there's no chance of it hitting the 60 votes needed to pass. Several Senate Democrats, including Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema and Dianne Feinstein, have expressed opposition to dumping the filibuster to pass the bill without GOP support.Newsweek reached out to Manchin's office for further comment.

    "body": "Although Congress is stalled on sweeping electoral reform legislation, the current voting rights emergency should cause Congress to consider a stopgap measure to combat this frightful rollback. The House has passed H.R. 1 , which is 800 pages of proposals aimed at improving U.S. elections. If enacted into law, it would negate efforts to undermine voting rights. But given the existence of the filibuster, the measure as written isn't going to pass the Senate. What about a much narrower bill, addressing only the emergency at hand? Are there 10 Republican senators willing to support a targeted law, to constrain state legislatures from dismantling voting rights previously granted? Here's why they should: First, a well-crafted law would not entirely prevent state legislatures from altering voting rules \u2014 it would just require a legislature to show sufficient justification for making the change. There could also be built-in flexibility: the greater the new impediment on the opportunity to vote, the stronger the state's showing would need to be. The flip side, however, would be that as long as the change in state law only minimally restricts casting ballots, the state would have significant leeway. Federal courts have been enforcing such standards for years as part of their responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution's equal protection clause. They would understand how to apply this new anti-rollback decree. For example, if a state still offered a robust period of in-person early voting, with plenty of times and places, then a state could justify a decision to curtail vote-by-mail by offering a nonpartisan explanation for why, after the pandemic is over, it would prefer to have ballots cast in person. This evaluation of adequate alternatives, to make sure states impose no danger of disenfranchisement, contrasts sharply with the approach taken by H.R. 1, which would require states to provide both in-person early voting and no-excuse vote-by-mail. Second, the credible threat of a much more intrusive law might bring enough moderate Republicans to the bargaining table. Right now, if there's no realistic fear that Democrats would actually eliminate the filibuster to adopt H.R. 1, there's no reason for Republicans to negotiate. But should Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) signal a willingness to entertain filibuster reform if Republicans remain obstinate on voting rights, then GOP senators would see it in their interest to compromise. Third, 10 reasonable Republicans might actually be willing to support, on the merits, a suitably tailored voting rights law. Whether for the sake of their legacies, or because they believe that preservation of adequate voting opportunities is a good idea, enough GOP senators might favor a calibrated rule that prevented state legislatures from going too far but did not cause Congress to become overly intrusive. Congress could limit this law's applicability to federal elections, leaving states unhindered in regulating elections exclusively for state and local offices \u2014 another bargaining chip potentially attractive to conservatives. The basic concept is what lawyers call non-retrogression. It means that the government can't take away rights, or make matters worse, without providing a good enough reason. Non-retrogression is the principle at the heart of Section 5, the Voting Rights Act provision that was nullified by the Supreme Court in its 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision . The court voided that provision because Congress applied it to some states and not others, and never updated this \u201c coverage formula \u201d in light of new circumstances. The court did not negate the principle of non-retrogression itself. Congress has been considering a revamped coverage formula to resurrect Section 5. While that remains worthwhile, the current emergency requires an immediate response \u2014 and one that's national in scope. The Voting Rights Act , designed to eradicate racial discrimination in voting, pursues the concept of non-retrogression through the lens of racial disparities. But the idea of non-retrogression can also apply to all voters regardless of race. If every voter suffers a setback in the opportunity to cast ballots, compared to how it was previously, then non-retrogression would require the state to defend that move \u2014 and to do so without considering comparative racial impact. In light of the unavoidably partisan overtones of race-based remedies in voting law, it might be strategically more prudent for Congress to craft a new non-retrogression provision in racially neutral terms. There's an argument that the Constitution implicitly contains this kind of non-retrogression principle, and thus federal courts already have the power to enforce it. But a new federal statute would put the principle on firmer footing, making the judicial duty to protect voting rights unmistakably clear. Given the speed with which state legislatures are acting, there's no time for Congress to waste: Congress should take what steps it can to ensure that everyone who is entitled to vote can do so.

    "body": "After a record number of Americans chose to cast their ballot by mail in 2020, Republican-led states and Democrat federal lawmakers are fighting a pitched battle over the rules governing the future of voting in the United States -- with special attention on whether voters will still be permitted to send their ballots through the mail.\nThis \"great clash,\" as it is framed by Michael Waldman, president of the bipartisan Brennan Center for Justice public policy institute, pits multiple Republican-controlled state legislatures pushing bills for tighter restrictions against a Democrat-dominated federal government that has pressed ahead with a nationwide voting rights package.\n\"In states across the country, Republican legislatures are racing to enact restrictions on voting rights -- the most significant wave of such restrictions since the Jim Crow era,\" Waldman said. Conversely, said Waldman, Congress \"can supersede that voter suppression wave, can override those laws.\"\nAt the heart of the fight is the widespread use of mail-in ballots. Voting by mail has been pushed by advocates for years, but the practice exploded in 2020 as a way to address the challenges of holding elections during the global coronavirus pandemic. Then-President Donald Trump seized on the practice -- both before and after his defeat -- to push unsupported claims that mail-in ballots are subject to greater risk of fraud, something experts have refuted.\nSince January, more than 250 bills that would restrict access to voting have been introduced in 43 statehouses, according to Brennan Center for Justice officials. The \"biggest chunk\" of these proposals would \"limit who can vote by mail and how easy it is to vote by mail,\" said Eliza Sweren-Becker, counsel in the Brennan Center's Democracy Program.\n\"Policymakers are essentially trying to put stumbling blocks in the way of voters in every step of the way in the mail voting process,\" Sweren-Becker said.\nMuch of the legislation being considered aims to slash recent rules that broadened access to voting by mail during the pandemic, such as no-excuse absentee voting and extended deadlines for ballots sent through the U.S. Postal Service.\nOpponents of these recent rules say that changes made during the pandemic were not intended to be permanent.  And they want to ensure that the act of in-person voting at polling precincts is not supplanted by more remote methods.\n\"Certainly some states want to reign in the practice pretty dramatically,\" said Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, which is advocating for tighter election laws, \"but most of the conversion is how we make this process work well and how to we secure this process.\"\n\"What we're talking about is the basic need to safeguard the process, and to show voters that the process has integrity can be trusted,\" Snead said.\nThe battle is particularly fierce in places like Arizona and Georgia, key battlegrounds where Democrat Joe Biden carried the vote, but Republicans maintain control of state government.\n\nArizona elections officials continue to count ballots inside the Maricopa County Recorder's Office, Nov. 6, 2020, in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\nIn Arizona, for example, one bill introduced by Republican legislators would require absentee ballots to be returned in person, not by mail. Conversely, another bill seeks to effectively ban the use of drop boxes and drive-through ballot drop-offs by mandating that absentee ballots can only be returned through the mail.\n\"So even within a single state sometimes there's a real conflict in the type of legislation being introduced,\" said Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund, a nonpartisan election advocacy group.\nFollowing the election, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey defended the state's election integrity in the face of criticism from Trump and others. \"I trust our election system. There's integrity in our election system,\" Ducey said in an interview in December.\nOn Monday in Georgia -- where increased turnout helped Biden win the presidency in November and two Democrats win the state's Senate seats in January -- the Republican-controlled state legislature approved a new measure to change the state's absentee voting laws over the objections of Democrats and voting rights advocates.\n\"I felt like there were not any unreasonable changes that were made,\" Republican state representative Dale Washburn said of the bill. \"[It] should provide more security and more confidence in the system.\"\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has repeatedly said there was no evidence of fraud in the state's election. \"We've never found systemic fraud, not enough to overturn the election,\" Raffenseperger told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in December.\nBecause Republicans control the levers of powers in both Arizona and Georgia, Sweren-Becker said, legislation aimed at curbing mail-in voting is expected to pass in some form.\nYet in Washington, where Biden is in the White House and Democrats now have majorities in both chambers of Congress, preserving access to absentee voting has emerged as a legislative priority.\nOn Thursday, the House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 1, a sweeping voting rights bill that expands access to absentee voting with nationwide baselines. Democrats have cited Republican efforts to curb mail-in voting rules at the state level as the impetus for the legislation, which, if passed and enacted, would take precedence over statewide regulations during federal elections.\n\"We're not pursuing this reform against the backdrop of the status quo,\" the bill's lead sponsor, Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., told ABC News. \"We're pursuing it against the prospect that the Republicans will take things in the wrong direction, and in a significant way.\"\nRepublican pushback to H.R. 1 has been swift and strong, with warnings that the bill's standards would usurp the states' constitutionally protected right to run their own elections.\nOn Thursday, 20 Republican state attorneys general warned that, if passed, the bill \"would federalize state elections and impose burdensome costs and regulations on state and local officials.\"\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, in an op-ed published this week in the Daily Signal, wrote that H.R. 1 would unfairly \"force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots.\"\n\nYellow mail-in ballots and assorted mail sit in a U.S Postal Service truck while being delivered to a residential neighborhood, Oct. 8, 2020, in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\"Election reform is a national imperative, but under our constitution, election reform must be undertaken at the state level,\" Pence wrote.\nOther experts fear that these statewide bills reflect partisan efforts to justify unsupported claims that the 2020 presidential election was undermined by widespread voter fraud.\n\"Lawmakers are using those lies to justify policies that limit voting access,\" Sweren-Becker said, calling it \"disingenuous and misleading.\"\nSweren-Becker called efforts in GOP strongholds to change absentee voting rules a \"backlash\" to Trump's defeat.\nPatrick, who said any so-called evidence of voter fraud underpinning these proposals is \"not based on the facts,\" called 2020 \"the most transparent election in our history.\"\n\"It was the most observed election; it was the most audited election,\" Patrick said. \"There are definitely things that could and should be done to improve the process, but far too often the proposals being made are based on misinformation and lies.\"\nIn Georgia, where Black voters propelled Biden's victory due in no small part to expanded access to no-excuse mail-in voting, critics of the GOP's statewide voting proposals claim they will disenfranchise large swaths of Black voters, who overwhelmingly support Democrats.\n\"Democrats are more likely to be people of color,\" said Stacy Abrams, a Georgia-based voting rights advocate and former Democratic candidate for governor. \"And so, whether [these bills] intend to target Democrats or not, they are absolutely targeting communities of color to silence their voices. But H.R. 1 would guarantee that, once again, we would have access to no-excuse absentee balloting.\"\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.",

Those lawmakers are Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.

The bill would\u00a0also expand early voting and enhance absentee voting by simplifying voting by mail. There was a surge in absentee voting during last year's primaries and general election due to health concerns of in-person voting at polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nIf passed into law, the bill would also enhance federal support for voting system security, increase oversight of election system vendors, upgrade online political ad disclosure and require all organizations involved in political activity to disclose their large donors, create a multiple matching system for small-dollar donations, which would be paid for by a new surcharge on \"corporate law breakers and wealthy tax cheats,\" tighten rules on super PACs, and beef up the enforcement powers of the Federal Election Commission.\n20 STATE AGS DENOUNCE DEMOCRATS HR1 AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nRepublicans slam the measure\u00a0saying it would lead to a federal government takeover of elections and\u00a0accuse Democrats of trying to change election rules to benefit themselves.

Brian Kemp of Georgia. And earlier this month in Iowa, GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that shortens the early voting period from 29 to 20 days \u2013 and requires that most absentee ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe current push by Republicans state lawmakers to beef up what they call election integrity was ignited by then-President Donald Trump's repeated claims ahead of last November's election that the loosening of restrictions on voting by mail would lead to \"massive voter fraud\" and \"rigged\" elections.\nAfter his defeat to President Biden, Trump falsely said that the election was \"stolen\" as he unsuccessfully tried to upend Biden's victory. Recent polling indicates that election integrity remains a major concern for Republican voters, as Trump's sway over the GOP remains immense.",

    "body": "Placeholder while article actions load\nThere are not many people who know exactly why FBI agents searched Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday. The FBI knows, certainly, and the former president and his attorneys likely have a good sense as well, given that they saw the search warrant. Everyone else is operating on what\u2019s been revealed by Trump\u2019s team and public reporting: The FBI search was largely or entirely a function of the investigation into Trump\u2019s retention of documents after leaving the White House.\n\n\nWe know that he did, by his own admission. Earlier this year, a number of boxes of material were turned over to the National Archives. Included in that material were some that were classified. On Monday, the FBI removed another dozen boxes, with speculation rampant that more of that material was similarly restricted.\n\nIf Trump is found to have violated federal law in removing and retaining classified documents without authorization, he could be convicted of a felony punishable by five years in prison. And that conviction would be a felony carrying that punishment because of a law signed by President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 campaign was intertwined with a similar question. His Democratic opponent, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, had been found to have operated a private email server that she used for official business \u2014 including, the FBI determined, some that was classified. Trump and his allies pushed for Clinton to face criminal charges but, in July 2016, FBI Director James B. Comey announced that the FBI wouldn\u2019t seek an indictment. Trump was furious, but he won anyway.\n\nDuring his first year in office, a central tool used for surveillance by the intelligence community \u2014 Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act \u2014 was set to expire. Shortly before it did, Congress passed an extension of the authority for another five years.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t come without turmoil. Trump came into office angry at the intelligence community for revealing to reporters that it believed Russia had interfered in the 2016 election. He excoriated intelligence agencies on Twitter \u2014 and continued to do so as the contours of the investigation into that interference became clear.\n\nOn the day that the House was set to vote on the reauthorization, Trump complained on Twitter:\n\n\u201cHouse votes on controversial FISA ACT today.\u201d This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\n\n(That initial phrase is in quotes because Trump, characteristically, was responding to something he saw on Fox News.)\n\nThe tweet freaked out advocates of the extension. A few hours later, he tweeted his support and it passed. On Jan. 18, 2018, he signed it into law.\n\nWhat became law was S. 139. It had been introduced by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) as the \u201cRapid DNA Act of 2017.\u201d But sometimes Congress hollows out existing legislation and replaces it entirely with other legislation to move the process forward more quickly. So S. 139 was replaced with H.R. 4478, which extended Section 702 for another five years.\n\nIt also had a stipulation editing 18 U.S. Code \u00a71924. It originally read:\n\nWhoever, being an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue of his office, employment, position, or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s signing S. 139 into law, that became: \u201c \u2026 shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.\u201d And, with that, it became a felony.\n\nYou can see how Trump absconding with classified material to Mar-a-Lago would facially violate the law as articulated. So Trump\u2019s allies have already been offering a rationalization: Trump had declassified everything he took to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Tuesday night, former Trump administration official Kash Patel made this case.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you definitively is that President Trump was a transparency president,\u201d Patel said when asked if there was any classified material at Trump\u2019s Florida estate. \u201cAnd time and time again \u2026 we tried to get all of it out. And President Trump, on multiple occasions at the White House, declassified whole sets of documents. Including \u2014 I remind you and your audience that around October of 2020, he issued a statement from the White House declassifying every document related to not just the Russiagate scandal, but also the Hillary Clinton email scandal.\u201d\n\nTrump did, in fact, order the wholesale declassification of a number of documents related to those investigations, including on the day before he left office. At that point, though, the order was to declassify documents that had been cleared by the FBI a few days prior.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart in May (at the time reports about classified material at Mar-a-Lago first emerged), Patel made a slightly different argument.\n\n\u201cTrump declassified whole sets of materials in anticipation of leaving government that he thought the American public should have the right to read themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House counsel failed to generate the paperwork to change the classification markings, but that doesn\u2019t mean the information wasn\u2019t declassified.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump declassified a bunch of stuff, even if there isn\u2019t record of it. This, obviously is very convenient \u2014 but also not completely ridiculous.\n\nIn 2017, on the day after he fired Comey, Trump welcomed senior Russian officials into the Oval Office for a meeting. During that discussion, he revealed to them classified information. That report spurred an unexpected defense as articulated by Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and others: the president has full authority to declassify things and can, in essence, do so on the fly. Fact-checkers considered this idea \u2026 and determined it to be largely accurate.\n\nWe\u2019re trudging toward a very gray area here, clearly, but it is conceivable that Trump\u2019s defense against his potential possession of classified material at Mar-a-Lago may be that he declassified it while still president, even if no formal record of the declassification was made. This introduces a slew of other questions, since that material would now presumably be publicly available in some form.\n\n\u201cThe president has unilateral authority to declassify documents \u2014 anything in government,\u201d Patel told Breitbart. \u201cHe exercised it here in full.\u201d\n\nPatel was one of the administration\u2019s most loyal defenders during Trump\u2019s presidency. As a staffer to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Patel was intimately involved in the congressman\u2019s fervent effort to push back against the investigation into Russian interference. Nunes was also a critic of Clinton\u2019s handling of her email server, suggesting at one point in 2016 that he hoped \u201cthe irresponsible handling of classified information documented by the FBI will be considered if any of these individuals currently possesses a security clearance or applies for one in the future.\u201d\n\nH.R. 4478, the legislation that became S. 139 and which escalated the punishment for the retention of classified material, was introduced in the House by Nunes.",

Today, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) have introduced companion legislation in the Senate. The bill prohibits discrimination\ufffd?\ufffdbased solely on disability before, during, and after an organ transplant procedure. This legislation reinforces and supplements rights established or supported by existing civil rights laws, most notably the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Sec. 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe bill is named for\ufffd?\ufffdCharlotte Woodward, an\ufffd?\ufffdadult with Down syndrome and member of the NDSS staff who received\ufffd?\ufffda life-saving heart transplant almost ten years ago. Since then, she has advocated tirelessly\ufffd?\ufffdto ensure\ufffd?\ufffdpeople with Down syndrome and other disabilities\ufffd?\ufffdget the same chance that she did.\n\n\"As someone with Down syndrome who has had the opportunity to receive a life-saving heart transplant, I am so very grateful that this bill will give others the same opportunity,\"\ufffd?\ufffdsaid\ufffd?\ufffdCharlotte Woodward.\ufffd?\ufffd\"Too many precious lives have been lost due to discrimination in organ\ufffd?\ufffdtransplantation. I am so very, very thankful for the generosity of my heart donor and that of her loving family. Her gift has allowed me to live my life to the fullest and to go on to advocate for others to be able to do the same. The passage of this bill will be a monumental step towards a more just world,\ufffd?\ufffdand I am proud to play a part in it.\"\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nIn addition to enumerating specific instances of potential discrimination, the bill also proactively promotes access to services by requiring health care providers to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures related to organ transplant care. Even so, the bill does not discount their professional judgment through new mandates. Instead, it clarifies what they are already meant to do: refrain from treating patients with disabilities differently than they would if they did not have disabilities.\n\n\"People with disabilities are no less deserving of life-saving organ transplants than people without disabilities,\" said NDSS President and CEO Kandi Pickard. \"We need a federal law to protect the rights of members of our community and to honor the value they bring to society. Charlotte's bill reflects the interstate nature of the organ transplant system, recognizes the need for expedited review when access is denied, and establishes a legal framework for individuals and providers to seek truth and reach meaningful resolution. We are grateful to Senators Rubio and Hassan for introducing this legislation.\"\n\nWhile Charlotte's bill was introduced almost a year ago, a recent story about a Florida infant named Zion Sarmiento has helped to elevate the issue of organ transplant discrimination. Baby Zion was born in June 2021 with Down syndrome and a congenital heart defect. Despite undergoing several surgeries, Zion needed a heart transplant to survive. He did not receive one and tragically passed away in October. With remarkable grace, the Sarmiento family has chosen to turn their grief into action and has been working with NDSS to advance Charlotte's bill.\n\n\"It is heartless to discriminate against someone in need of an organ transplant because they have a disability,\" Senator Rubio said. \"Zion, a 16-week old baby with Down syndrome, passed away because he was denied an organ transplant. Zion's story is not only devastating, it is unacceptable. This legislation would honor Zion's life and help ensure that what happened to him never happens to anyone else.\"\n\n\"People with disabilities are too often overlooked and in being denied full inclusion can encounter hurdles that many of us cannot even begin to imagine, including when it comes to receiving\ufffd?\ufffdthe life-saving care of an organ transplant,\" said Senator Hassan. \"All individuals should be guaranteed quality of care, and that's something I'll always fight for. I'm proud to help lead this effort with Senator Rubio to make sure that discrimination has no place in medical care.\"\n\nNDSS\ufffd?\ufffdhas resources available to assist those seeking to prevent discrimination in organ transplantation against people with disabilities.

NDSS envisions a world in which all people with Down syndrome\ufffd?\ufffdhave the opportunity to\ufffd?\ufffdenhance their quality of life, realize their life aspirations and\ufffd?\ufffdbecome valued members of welcoming communities.

It would require states to automatically register eligible voters, as well as offer same-day registration. It would limit states\u2019 ability to purge registered voters from their rolls and restore former felons\u2019 voting rights. Among dozens of other provisions, it would also require states to offer 15 days of early voting and allow no-excuse absentee balloting.\nMcCarthy argued that Democrats should be focused on \"securing our border\" and \"getting small business\u00a0back to work.\"\u00a0\nThe chairs of the two GOP congressional reelection committees sound very confident that Republicans will win back majorities in the\u00a0House of Representatives\u00a0and\u00a0Senate\u00a0in the\u00a02022 midterms.\n\"We\u2019re going to take back the Senate, absolutely,\"\u00a0Sen. Rick Scott\u00a0of Florida, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, vowed in an interview with Fox News two months ago.\nAnd National Republican Congressional Committee chair\u00a0Rep.

While the GOP lost control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans flipped a dozen House seats and need a net gain of just five in the 435-member chamber in November to win back a majority they held for eight years before losing it amid a blue wave in the 2018 midterms.\nRepublicans have history on their side. On average, the party that wins the White House in a presidential election loses more than 25 House seats in the ensuing midterm election. And the once-in-a-decade congressional redistricting process may favor the GOP, as Republicans control more state legislatures and governors' offices than the Democrats.\nHouse retirements are often seen as an early barometer of things to come in the midterms. And last year 23 House Democrats announced that they'd retire after the current term or seek another office in the 2022 elections, compared to only 13 House Republicans.\nMCCARTHY LIKENS 2022 MIDTERMS TO \u2018100-YEAR STORM\u2019\n\"If we are able to win a\u00a0majority, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able\u00a0to govern,\" McCarthy told Bartiromo on Sunday, noting that \"the lines have not been\u00a0drawn yet.\"\u00a0\nHe also pointed to all the House Democrat retirements.\u00a0\nWhen asked how many House seats he thinks can be flipped McCarthy responded that Republicans \"want to earn enough that we\u00a0have a governing majority,\" which he said \"means getting in the realm\u00a0of 20 and higher.\"\u00a0\n\"If we are fortunate enough to\u00a0win 35 Republican seats, that\u00a0would be the largest Republican\u00a0majority in more than a hundred\u00a0years,\" he said.\u00a0\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) emphasized to Fox News that \"House Democrats are heading into the midterms with record-breaking fundraising numbers, earlier than ever investments in organizing, and an agenda that\u2019s wildly popular among battleground voters.\"\u00a0\nDCCC spokesperson Chris Taylor argued that because \"voters see Democratic members and candidates focused on rebooting the economy and getting folks back on the job,\" the DCCC's believes that \"incumbent or not, we\u2019re confident in our ability to win the House yet again.\"\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser and Brittany De Lea contributed to this report.",

    "body": "\u201cThe huge difference between drug prices and literally everything else out there: Everything else costs money, and this one saves money,\u201d said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, whose group is in close contact with congressional staffers on drug pricing.\n\nThe long-running drug pricing debate, propelled by bipartisan voter anger over high medicine costs, had been stalled by the pandemic before it sprang back to life last week with two major developments: House Democrats began exploring whether to include negotiations in the forthcoming infrastructure package, and one of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s most vocal critics, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), abruptly scheduled the first hearing on drug prices in the new Congress for Tuesday.\n\nThe hearing announcement jolted some pharma lobbyists, who told POLITICO it signaled the industry could become the \u201cpiggy bank\u201d for the infrastructure bill. It also underscored the challenge the industry faces in trying to use the pandemic to alter its perception from price-gougers to world-savers.\n\nPOLITICO spoke with more than a dozen industry lobbyists, Hill aides and advocates about revived talks over drug prices. Many of them requested anonymity to share sensitive discussions that are still in the early stages.\n\n\u201cSomething is coming. We\u2019re just not sure when,\u201d said one drug industry lobbying source.\n\nDemocratic leaders are widely expected to advance the infrastructure package using a budget maneuver known as reconciliation, which would allow them to pass it with simple majorities in both chambers. That could let them tack on party priorities on health care, climate change and other policies that could otherwise fall victim to the Senate filibuster.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders are still examining whether their negotiation bill, numbered H.R. 3 (116) in the previous Congress, would satisfy the complex requirements for reconciliation, which they recently used to deliver the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan along party lines.\n\nSome drug industry lobbyists told POLITICO they believe that enough Senate moderates may have reservations about the House bill and the way it would, for example, limit the maximum negotiated price to what\u2019s paid for the drug in other developed countries. Those lobbyists also believe the industry\u2019s hand has been strengthened by the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines that can bring the pandemic under control.\n\n\u201cI think getting moderate Senate Democrats on board for H.R. 3 is going to be a challenge, and I think there\u2019s a lot of salient points attacking that policy around cures and the investments in the Covid vaccines, which have been shown to be effective,\u201d said one health care lobbyist who\u2019s been closely tracking Capitol Hill talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who campaigned on drug pricing negotiations, hasn\u2019t said yet whether the House\u2019s negotiation measure should be included in the infrastructure package. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\n\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who campaigned on drug pricing negotiations, hasn\u2019t said yet whether the House\u2019s negotiation measure should be included in the infrastructure package. An administration official pointed to the Biden campaign\u2019s plan, which also called for limits on drugs\u2019 launch prices and prices hikes.\n\nHouse Democrats approved their negotiation bill in the previous Congress, but it never came up for a vote in the Senate, which at the time was controlled by Republicans. Senate Democrats haven\u2019t indicated whether they support including the negotiation measure in the infrastructure package, but it would come with attractive savings: $456 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nDemocratic leaders aren\u2019t yet saying much publicly about their strategy for drug pricing, which aides and lobbyists said were in early phases. A senior Democratic aide in a statement called negotiations a \u201ctop priority\u201d for this Congress.\n\nDrugmakers are also holding their fire. Brian Newell, spokesperson for drug lobbying giant PhRMA, said the group is \u201cready to work with policymakers\u201d to lower what patients pay out of pocket for drugs and \u201cprotect access to medicines and preserve future innovation\u201d \u2014 nodding to industry arguments that government negotiations would result in drugs being withheld from patients and shrunken investments in research and development.\n\nPrivately, some drug industry lobbyists said they hoped to nudge Democrats toward focusing on a separate \u2014 and narrower \u2014 drug pricing effort that came out of the Senate Finance Committee with some bipartisan support last Congress. The bill, from Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and then-Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), doesn\u2019t authorize negotiations but aims to curb drug price hikes in Medicare and caps seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, as the House version would.\n\nIt's not that the industry likes the measure \u2014 and many Republicans have compared its central provision targeting price increases to \u201cprice controls\u201d that are anathema to conservative orthodoxy. But it would mean a significantly smaller dent to industry profits. The Medicare restrictions on price hikes would save the federal government about $50 billion, just a fraction of savings from the House\u2019s negotiation bill.\n\nDemocratic leaders meanwhile will face pressure from the party\u2019s progressive wing, who will push for the infrastructure bill to include their priorities after the $15 minimum wage was dropped from the recent stimulus package. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has said any drug pricing legislation should be more aggressive than H.R. 3, which didn\u2019t extend the price hike protections to private health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is that no American should pay more for their drugs than anyone else in any other country,\u201d Jayapal said last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has said any drug pricing legislation should be more aggressive than H.R. 3, which didn\u2019t extend the price hike protections to private health insurance. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nProgressives could find new support from major employer groups that have historically been wary of price controls but are increasingly fed up with shouldering high health care costs. One of those groups, the Purchaser Business Group on Health, which represents large companies including Walmart and Boeing, said it\u2019s in discussions to support a negotiation bill if it includes limits on price hikes for private health plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to play ball, and I think that having big employers on board could do a lot for Democrats on pushing back on the narrative the pharmaceutical industry is going to push is that this is bad for the economy and bad for business,\u201d said Shawn Gremminger, the group\u2019s director of health policy. \u201cWe think we could have a substantial role to play here.\u201d\n\nWyden last week told reporters the House bill and his own are Democrats\u2019 starting point for drug pricing legislation in this Congress. While he called the House measure\u2019s negotiation provision \u201curgent business,\u201d Wyden\u2019s legislation is seen as more acceptable to Democratic moderates wary of negotiations.\n\nIn a Senate split 50-50, the threat of a single defection from a Democratic moderate could force the party to narrow its drug pricing ambitions.\n\nDrug lobbyists sees a potential ally in Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona moderate who has shown a willingness to break with her party. She tallied $121,000 in campaign donations from drugmakers and pharmaceutical lobbying groups during the 2020 election cycle, more than double what she received the previous two-year cycle when she was on the ballot, according to an analysis by Kaiser Health News. Her office did not return a request for comment.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who\u2019s emerged as a power broker for moderates, has co-sponsored legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate prices. However, he hasn\u2019t indicated whether he would support including drug price negotiations in the infrastructure package.",

    "body": "CALGARY, Alberta, Dec 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Maxim Power Corp. (\"MAXIM\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: MXG) provides an update on its 204 MW Milner 2 (\"M2\") operations, the combined cycle gas turbine (\"CCGT\") expansion of M2 project, and updated Investor Presentation.  M2 OPERATIONS UPDATE  As previously reported, M2 initiated a routine planned maintenance outage on November 9, 2021 and also performed work to integrate several critical components of the CCGT expansion of M2. The outage was completed on November 30, 2021 and M2 returned to normal operation on December 1, 2021.  M2 CCGT PROJECT UPDATE  As a result of work performed during the planned maintenance outage in November, M2 has successfully increased its maximum electrical interconnection capacity with the Alberta Electric System Operator to 300 MW to facilitate the CCGT expansion of M2, which is not anticipated to be in commercial operation until December 2022. In the meantime, MAXIM is authorized to operate the legacy 144 MW H.R. Milner facility (\"M1\") in tandem with the M2 facility, up to a combined total output of 300 MW. MAXIM has successfully demonstrated two-unit operation from both M1 and M2 with each unit operating as stand-alone power plants. This significant milestone confirms the interconnection is complete to allow for the CCGT expansion of M2. MAXIM notes that M1 as a stand-alone power plant is subject to federal greenhouse gas regulations which limit the annual hours of operation from the unit. MAXIM does not anticipate fully utilizing the M1 unit up to its authorized maximum operating hours.  Progress continues on the engineering and construction of the CCGT expansion of M2 and as of this date the project remains on schedule with no change to the previously reported estimated project costs of $135 million.  At this time, MAXIM forecasts it has sufficient liquidity to complete the CCGT expansion of M2 and will fund the project using cash on hand, operating cashflows and available funds through the existing senior and subordinated credit facilities, as required.  UPDATED INVESTOR PRESENTATION  An updated investor presentation has been prepared for readers and can be accessed through MAXIM's website in the Investors section.  About MAXIM  Based in Calgary, Alberta, MAXIM is one of Canada's largest truly independent power producers. MAXIM is now focused entirely on power projects in Alberta. Its core asset - the 204 MW H.R. Milner Plant, M2, in Grande Cache, AB - is a state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant that commissioned in Q2, 2020. MAXIM is currently increasing the capacity of M2 to approximately 300 MW and concurrently will realize an improvement in the efficiency of the plant by investing in heat recovery combined cycle technology. In addition, MAXIM continues to explore additional development options in Alberta including its currently permitted gas-fired generation project and the permitting of its wind power generation project. MAXIM trades on the TSX under the symbol \"MXG\". For more information about MAXIM, visit our website at www.maximpowercorp.com.

    "body": "Conway posted a letter refusing to leave the Board of Visitors of the Air Force Academy , saying the removals would \"politicize\" the academies and discourage others from serving. \"News reports suggest you have made the same demand of other men and women who were duly appointed to service academy boards,\" she said in the letter addressed to Biden, later adding: \"The result is that faithful and willing public servants will be discouraged or thwarted from service. Our service academies will risk being further politicized and polarized.\" Military academies including West Point, the Air Force Academy and the Naval Academy have non-partisan advisory panels made up of presidential and congressional appointees who serve three year terms. The boards provide non-binding advice to the schools on matters such as curriculum and student resources. Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Wednesday that Biden has asked several appointees from the previous administration, such as Conway and former press secretary Sean Spicer, to resign from their appointed positions on various service academy board positions. Spicer, who also questioned the decision in a tweet , had been appointed to the Naval Academy visitors' board. Psaki said the move was \"to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values.\" She added, \"I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified or not political to serve on these boards. But the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration.

    "body": "Every president has the right to make such moves, but that doesn\u2019t mean this decision isn\u2019t scandalous. If Trump had removed a predecessor\u2019s appointee of McMaster\u2019s stature, the resulting criticism would have been deafening. Compare that to the current mainstream outrage level, which sounds more like crickets.This much is indisputable: Lt. Gen. McMaster is highly qualified for this role. He is a graduate of the United States Military Academy and has also served there as an assistant professor of history. As Politico reports, \u201cLater this week McMaster is getting honored by West Point\u2019s Association of Graduates as a Distinguished Graduate of the academy.\u201d This is all to say his academic and military qualifications are beyond reproach.Now, McMaster didn\u2019t always cover himself in glory during his tenure at the White House. But to the degree that he was complicit in the Trump administration\u2019s sins, McMaster\u2014much like former Defense SecretaryJames Mattis \u2014helped mitigate some of the damage Trump might otherwise have inflicted.Biden Isn\u2019t Trump. He\u2019s a Disaster In His Own Right.The same could not be said of some of the other Trump administration officials who are also being asked to step down from military boards. Mixed in with names like McMaster, the list includes some partisan political operatives with dubious qualifications. White House Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki hinted at who these might be in what amounts to a strawman argument about the purge: \u201cI will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards.\u201d Psaki seemed to suggest that Conway and Spicer were indicative of the 18 military academy board appointees being pushed out.In this regard, McMaster\u2019s sacking is both obscured and diminished by virtue of being part of a large-scale \u201cmassacre\u201d (Purging one person can be a tragedy. Eighteen is a statistic). Instead of being overwhelmed by the number of people involved (or distracted by the worthy victims like Conway and Spicer), a purge of this magnitude is about pandering to Biden\u2019s progressive base and paying back his critics. I have no idea what Conway\u2019s connections to the military are, but Spicer is a commander in the US Navy Reserve. As far as we know, he has served his country honorably in uniform, but the same can\u2019t be said of his service in a suit and tie, in which capacity he brazenly and routinely violated the U.S. Navy\u2019s honor code: \u201cBe honest and truthful in our dealings with each other, and with those outside the Navy,\u201d and \u201cEncourage new ideas and deliver the bad news, even when it is unpopular.\u201d Both are refusing to go quietly, with Spicer now threatening to sue. In a tweet, Conway complained that the move \u201cseems petty and political, if not personal.\u201d That may not apply to Conway, but it does to McMaster and others Biden just pushed out. McMaster recently criticized Biden and Trump for \u201ccapitulation\u201d to the Taliban. And Jack Keane, a retired four-star general who was also sacked, has also been a staunch critic of Biden\u2019s foreign policy decisions. They have both been removed from their board seats after progressives ripped TV news for having them on to comment on the Afghanistan withdrawal. Trump liked to boast about \u201cmy generals.\u201d Now Biden gets to fire them, albeit from what were board positions rather than command ones. Trump was not a normal president, and it is unreasonable to ask Biden to simply accept all of his eleventh-hour appointments. Still, he could have easily removed a couple of unqualified or unfit board members, instead of going overboard like this. McMaster and Conway represent extreme ends of a tumultuous presidency. But Biden has treated them the same way, choosing a path where everyone from the Trump era is politically dead to him. Take no prisoners. No mercy. No exceptions. They\u2019re all bad. Revenge is Biden\u2019s prerogative, but it\u2019s not what we were promised and it\u2019s an approach that will almost certainly lead to more such reprisals in the administrations to come.

    "body": "Audits of elections should be conducted in every state, Hans von Spakovsky,\u00a0manager of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative and a senior legal fellow of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, said on Tuesday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Daily\u00a0with host Alex Marlow, author of\u00a0Breaking the News: Exposing the Establishment Media\u2019s Hidden Deals and Secret\u00a0Corruption.\n\nMarlow asked, \u201cDo you believe that these audits that are popping up in a couple of places are productive? And do you have any hopes for what we might learn from this Arizona audit that should be wrapping up sometime this week??\n\nVon Spakovksy replied, \u201cYes. I think, actually, audits ought to be conducted in every state after elections, and I fault Merrick Garland,\u00a0in fact, for discouraging audits. He attacked audits in his speech. \u2026 We don\u2019t know what the Maricopa audits are going to turn up, but I\u2019ll give you \u2026 the reason audits are necessary. They just completed an audit in Wyndham, New Hampshire, of a small race there from last year\u2019s election. And guess what they found? They found when they hand-counted their ballots, that apparently their computer scanners were misreading the ballots.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThey discovered a problem with with their voting equipment. The result was that they realized that the winning candidates in\u00a0 last year\u2019s election didn\u2019t get 300 votes that they should have been credited with, and they also found that the losing candidate \u2014 who they thought only lost by two dozen votes \u2014 actually had lost by over a hundred votes. If they hadn\u2019t conducted this audit, they wouldn\u2019t have realized they had this problem in their voting equipment. Now they can fix it so it doesn\u2019t happen in future elections.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 For the People Act \u2014 H.R.1 in the House and S.1 in the Senate \u2014\u00a0amount to a federalization of the election process, von Spakovsky explained, \u201cto get rid of all of the safety and security protocols that states have in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt voids all state voter-ID laws,\u201d von Spakovsky said of the For the People Act. \u201cIt requires all states to put in online voter registration, which as you know, is an invitation to fraud by hackers and others. \u2026 Then it makes changes in federal campaign finance laws that are intended to basically restrict political speech and political activity.\u201d",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) derided the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, touted by the Biden White House, and called it a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d for socialism.\n\nThe Florida Republican lawmaker speculated inflation resulting from the massive government spending could be on the way.\n\n\u201cIt is a Trojan Horse for socialism,\u201d he said. It is everything Democrats have wanted wrapped and branded in coronavirus so that people are scared into voting for it. And the point that was made by your financial panel earlier is entirely correct. This is only the beginning. And we are about to see massive inflation in this country as a consequence of no real pressure against the printing of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only reasons that we haven\u2019t seen that inflation yet: One, we\u2019ve had downward pressure as a result of the lower cost of transmitting data,\u201d Gaetz continued. \u201cSecond, the dollar continues to be very attractive globally for people to acquire. And I think that as we roll into the second and third rounds of stimulus, you put the dollars, the global reserve currency, in more jeopardy than it is today.\u201d\n\nAlso, during the segment, Gaetz called H.R. 1, a bill that would reform the country\u2019s election processes, \u201clegalized cheating.\u201d",

    "body": "The intervention by prominent American business executives into partisan cultural politics is a major event, and we wonder how many of these CEOs have thought through the implications. To wit, they are pitting themselves against the interests of their own shareholders.\n\nCompanies have long sought to influence policies that affect their business, and rightly so. They have the First Amendment right to petition the government. And as the reach of the state has grown, the success or failure of a firm or industry can depend on defeating political predators in Washington or state capitals. We wish it were otherwise, but this is today\u2019s reality.\n\nThe CEO intervention into Georgia election law is different. It concerns a matter that doesn\u2019t directly affect Coca-Cola or Delta Airlines , to cite two companies whose executives condemned the new law. The CEOs are instead injecting themselves into a heated debate over election law and the tension between ballot access and integrity.\n\nThis is about the rules of politics, and it means taking sides in a debate between the electoral interests of the two parties. Republicans in Georgia tightened what they regarded as loose rules that accommodated the special circumstances of the pandemic. Democrats claim the rules are too restrictive and want to stigmatize them as \u201cJim Crow 2.0\u201d to help them pass a national election law (H.R.1) that would impose voting rules they prefer.\n\nThis is the kind of brawl that most CEOs typically avoid as too polarizing, and even business lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce tend to steer clear.

    "body": "Topline\n \nThe House on Tuesday debated a Democrat-led election reform bill, with several Republicans who sought to have the federal government overturn 2020 election results in key states arguing the bill would infringe on states\u2019 rights, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) even asserting it misidentifies where \u201creal voter suppression\u201d is taking place.\n \n \n  \n  \n   \n   WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 25: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a protective mask bearing the ... [+] words \"This mask is as useless as Joe Biden,\" as she walks with an aide to a vote in the Cannon Tunnell on Capitol Hill, on February 25, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)\n \n   \n  Getty Images \n  \n \nKey Facts\n \n \n  \n  Greene argued in a floor speech that voter suppression \u201chappens right here in Congress,\u201d pointing to coronavirus restrictions and metal detectors \u2013 set up in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack \u2013 that create lines for House members to vote.\n \n \n \n  \n  Greene complained lawmakers are \u201ctreated very disrespectfully\u201d when they go to vote on legislation, adding, \u201cstanding in line to vote is not voter suppression, it\u2019s just part of the voting process, just like people stand in line to buy groceries.\u201d\n \n   \n \n \n  \n  H.R. 1, or the For The People Act, which passed in 2019 but was blocked from the floor of the GOP-controlled Senate, would counter some state restrictions on voting, create new limits on political spending and gerrymandering and institute new ethics rules for federal officials.\n \n   \n \n \n  \n  Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), who supported a lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to overturn four states\u2019 election results and attempted to have Congress invalidate Georgia\u2019s electors, said the bill would \u201cnationalize\u201d elections and warned against \"restricting the right of states to run their own elections.\"\n \n \n \n  \n  Other Republicans who supported overturning the election made similar arguments: Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) labeled the bill a \u201cfederal takeover of elections,\u201d Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) said it \u201cinfringes on states\u2019 rights,\u201d and Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said it \u201cflies in the face of our governors, our secretaries of state, our local election officials.\u201d\n \n \n \n\n \nCrucial Quote\n \n\u201cIt may be a novel idea, but I stand firmly against federal overreach in the constitutional responsibilities of state and local governments,\u201d said Loudermilk, who voted to have Congress decertify the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n \nKey Background\n \nPalmer, Lesko and Loudermilk were also among the 126 House Republicans who signed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to have the Supreme Court overturn the results of the election in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.\n \nTangent\n \nSeveral Senate Republicans who voted for Electoral College objections have proposed their own bill to severely restrict voting, including overriding some state reforms. Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) want to cap early voting periods, require states to stop automatically sending out mail-in ballots and force local election officials to count votes uninterrupted until the election tally is complete.\n \nWhat To Watch For\n \nH.R. 1 faces an uphill battle in the Senate, even as Democrats now control the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has vowed to make it a priority, but Republican opposition to the bill is unified, and attaining the 10 Senate Republican votes needed to avert a filibuster is a daunting task.",

Jim Banks (R-IN), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), said during an RSC meeting Thursday the Joe Biden administration \u201cseems to be doing exactly the opposite\u201d of what is needed to confront China.\n\nBanks held his weekly RSC meeting with former Donald Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who explained to the House conservatives how to combat a rising China.\n\nBanks opened the question and answer portion of the meeting, asking what conservatives could do to combat the Chinese Communist Party. He also noted the Biden administration seems to be taking a softer approach towards China.\n\nMy first simple question: It seems like the Biden administration is doing exactly the opposite of everything that you just recommended to us. Why is that, and what do we have to do as conservative Republican members in the House to make this issue, to make our efforts to confront the Chinese Communist Party, hold the CCP accountable, what do we have to do to make that a bipartisan issue again because at the moment, the partisan dividing line is as clear ever?\n\nAfter the RSC meeting, Banks, a member of the Armed Services Committee, introduced five bills to counter the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\u201cThe greatest threat to American freedom and justice is the Chinese Communist Party, which is why I\u2019m proud to advance these five pieces of legislation to protect America\u2019s interests from Beijing,\u201d Banks said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cChina is our foremost military adversary, but it also seeks to infiltrate our economy, universities, digital infrastructure, and intelligence agencies,\u201d Banks added. \u201cCongress should be focused on safeguarding each of these American institutions from the Chinese regime.",

    "body": "The 2020 election cycle left a wide range of Americans feeling unsettled about the election process in this country. With new election laws to accommodate mail-in ballots and other pandemic related changes made by election bureaucrats and the courts, many Americans wondered aloud if the election would transcend traditional partisan politics and inspire confidence in the election\u2019s results.\n Of course, the typical partisan bickering has persisted past the election, with politicians staking out reflexive, knee-jerk positions that seem more geared to entrench their own interests rather than create viable solutions to empower voters.\n Election reform is needed, but the U.S. House-proposed \u201cH.R. 1\u201d bill does not appear to be the answer. There are elements of the legislation that create reasonable concern \u2013 such as repealing voter identification laws in every state and allowing ballot harvesting.\n These concerns touch on a pillar of successful election reform: security. If you do not have transparent and airtight security measures to ensure every vote is legal and every legal vote is counted, how do you expect voters to have confidence in the election?\n   H.R. 1 does not require all states to authenticate voters\u2019 citizenship and identity before casting ballots. The bill also permits all states to allow third parties to collect an unlimited number of sealed absentee ballots.\n More concerns can be raised about the spate of emerging state-driven election rules. This is why sensible, voter-driven election reform is the path forward.\n Let\u2019s continue with this straightforward agreement around national interest: Election rules should not be designed to benefit either party.\n Partisan election reform, whether driven by Democrats or championed by Republicans, is always a bad deal for voters looking for fair and equal access to voting rights. Election reform, by definition, needs to be driven by a bi-partisan coalition that rises above partisan advantage as an end-goal and has as its purpose the expansion of voting rights and the protection of voter confidence in election integrity.\n We had an example of ideal election security measures right here in Pennsylvania. In a successful argument before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Pennsylvania Department of State argued there was little chance for voting fraud because Pennsylvania requires all mail-in ballots be signed and dated. The problem with that argument: Pennsylvania Department of State, going against its own agency guidance, did not uniformly apply this standard in every one of Pennsylvania\u2019s 67 counties. The result: people\u2019s trust in fair elections is eroded.\n \n Election integrity requires uniform standards \u2013 you cannot have fair elections if the rules are different depending on where you live or what political party runs the bureau of elections.\n There are security applications of this approach that can work across the entire country, and a national election reform commission \u2013 not just bi-partisan, but non-partisan \u2013 is a sensible step toward elevating best practices at the state level. Pennsylvania formed a bi-partisan election reform commission, and I hope it will bring together the same kind of honest, civic-minded experts who successfully managed the extreme polarization and uncertainty of the 2020 election.\n On the formative issue of election reform, putting people before partisan politics is the essential first test if voting reforms are really in the best interest of voters.\n State Senator John T. Yudichak,\u00a0founder of\u00a0People. Not Politics.,\u00a0is in his third term serving Carbon and Luzerne counties as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate.",

    "body": "McMaster from the United States Military Academy (also known as West Point). Every president has the right to make such moves, but that doesn't mean this decision isn't scandalous. If Trump had removed a predecessor's appointee of McMaster's stature, the resulting criticism would have been deafening. Compare that to the current mainstream outrage level, which sounds more like crickets. This much is indisputable: Lt. Gen. McMaster is highly qualified for this role. He is a graduate of the United States Military Academy and has also served there as an assistant professor of history. As Politico reports , \u201cLater this week McMaster is getting honored by West Point's Association of Graduates as a Distinguished Graduate of the academy.\u201d This is all to say his academic and military qualifications are beyond reproach. Now, McMaster didn't always cover himself in glory during his tenure at the White House. But to the degree that he was complicit in the Trump administration's sins, McMaster\u2014much like former Defense Secretary James Mattis \u2014helped mitigate some of the damage Trump might otherwise have inflicted. The same could not be said of some of the other Trump administration officials who are also being asked to step down from military boards . Mixed in with names like McMaster, the list includes some partisan political operatives with dubious qualifications. White House Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki hinted at who these might be in what amounts to a strawman argument about the purge: \u201cI will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards.\u201d Psaki seemed to suggest that Conway and Spicer were indicative of the 18 military academy board appointees being pushed out. In this regard, McMaster's sacking is both obscured and diminished by virtue of being part of a large-scale \u201cmassacre\u201d (Purging one person can be a tragedy. Eighteen is a statistic). Instead of being overwhelmed by the number of people involved (or distracted by the worthy victims like Conway and Spicer), a purge of this magnitude is about pandering to Biden's progressive base and paying back his critics. I have no idea what Conway's connections to the military are, but Spicer is a commander in the US Navy Reserve. As far as we know, he has served his country honorably in uniform, but the same can't be said of his service in a suit and tie, in which capacity he brazenly and routinely violated the U.S. Navy's honor code : \u201cBe honest and truthful in our dealings with each other, and with those outside the Navy,\u201d and \u201cEncourage new ideas and deliver the bad news, even when it is unpopular.\u201d Both are refusing to go quietly, with Spicer now threatening to sue . In a tweet, Conway complained that the move \u201cseems petty and political, if not personal.\u201d That may not apply to Conway, but it does to McMaster and others Biden just pushed out. McMaster recently criticized Biden and Trump for \u201ccapitulation\u201d to the Taliban. And Jack Keane, a retired four-star general who was also sacked, has also been a staunch critic of Biden's foreign policy decisions. They have both been removed from their board seats after progressives ripped TV news for having them on to comment on the Afghanistan withdrawal. Trump liked to boast about \u201cmy generals.\u201d Now Biden gets to fire them, albeit from what were board positions rather than command ones. Trump was not a normal president, and it is unreasonable to ask Biden to simply accept all of his eleventh-hour appointments. Still, he could have easily removed a couple of unqualified or unfit board members, instead of going overboard like this. McMaster and Conway represent extreme ends of a tumultuous presidency. But Biden has treated them the same way, choosing a path where everyone from the Trump era is politically dead to him. Take no prisoners. No mercy. No exceptions. They're all bad. Revenge is Biden's prerogative, but it's not what we were promised and it's an approach that will almost certainly lead to more such reprisals in the administrations to come.",

    "body": "state legislatures to roll back voting access in the wake of former president Donald Trump's 2020 loss and his baseless effort to cast doubt on the integrity of U.S. elections. The order comes on the 56th anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d the day on which state troopers violently beat hundreds of marchers, including John Lewis, the late civil rights icon and Democratic congressman from Georgia, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. \u201cToday, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am signing an executive order to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and improve access to voting,\u201d Biden said Sunday in a videotaped address to the Martin and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast. \u201cEvery eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.\u201d The order directs federal agencies to develop a strategic plan for promoting voter registration and participation, including potentially applying to be a state-designated voter registration agency and providing recommendations on leave for federal employees to vote or to serve as poll workers. Some states have programs to automatically register eligible Americans to vote, unless they opt out, when they interact with DMVs as well as state agencies that administer federal programs such as military recruitment, Medicaid and food stamps. Under the Trump administration, however, some federal agencies refused to share the data that would allow states to automatically register voters this way, citing concerns about the privacy of health data. Biden's executive order instructs federal agencies to relax that policy. The order also aims to expand access to voting among active-duty members of the military as well as to all eligible federally incarcerated people. And it establishes a steering group on Native American voting rights tasked with producing recommendations by next year on expanding voter outreach and turnout among Native American communities. Biden's move comes days after the House passed expansive legislation to create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting. The measure, H.R. 1, largely mirrors a bill passed by the chamber two years ago. But it has faced fierce Republican attacks that threaten to stop it cold in the Senate. The bill's voting provisions would guarantee no-excuse mail voting and at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections; require states to use their government records to automatically register citizens to vote; restore voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences; and mandate the use of paper ballots. During his remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Trump blasted H.R. 1, accusing Democrats of wanting to register all welfare recipients to vote. No Republicans voted for the bill in 2019 or last week, when it was approved 220 to 210. Dozens of Republican-controlled state legislatures, meanwhile, are considering sweeping new laws that would restrict voting options ahead of the 2022 midterms. Critics argue that the proposed laws, which would restrict absentee balloting, early voting and other aspects of election administration, represent a cynical ploy to make it harder primarily for Democratic voters to participate.

The officials include several notable figures from the previous administration who were appointed in its final days, including former press secretary Sean Spicer, former senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who were each appointed to the boards advising the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and West Point, respectively.

On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the order, saying: \u201cI will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards, but the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration, they are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you're aligned with the values of this administration.\u201d According to the language on the Air Force Academy website, the boards advise the institutions on the \u201cmorale, discipline, social climate, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters.\u201d Terms normally expire after three years. While some of the Trump appointees agreed to resign, Trump's Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought tweeted a screenshot of the White House request saying: \u201cNo. It's a three year term.\u201d Sean Spicer used the opportunity for self-promotion, saying that he would respond on his show on Newsmax.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate Rules and Administration Committee Tuesday defeated an amendment from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to Democrats' sweeping elections bill.\nMcConnell's amendment, which was defeated on a 9-9 party-line vote,\u00a0would keep the Federal Election Commission (FEC)\u00a0at six members rather than five, which the Democrats bill would do if enacted.\u00a0\nThe bill, S. 1 in the Senate and H.R. 1 in the House, would change the composition of the FEC from six members with three from each party to five members with two from each party and a fifth not associated with either party but chosen by the president.\u00a0\nMcConnell, R-Ky., making a rare appearance at a committee markup, said that Democrats' proposed change to the FEC would make it partisan and go against the goals of the Democrat-controlled Congress that created it.\u00a0\n\n      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks during a news conference at Kroger Field in Lexington, Ky., Monday, April 5, 2021. McConnell made a rare appearance in the Senate Rules and Administration Committee Tuesday. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)\n      \n\n\nSCHUMER AND MCCONNELL SPAR OVER TRUMP, STATE ELECTION LAWS IN SHOWDOWN OVER DEMOCRAT-BACKED ELECTIONS BILL\n\"The FEC was created back in 1974 in the wake of Watergate. That was a period during which our Democratic colleagues had overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate,\" McConnell said. \"They could have crafted the FEC any way they chose to. But they realized that it ought to be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. It was broad bipartisan understanding that the new panel needed to be beyond reproach. That's why it was built with an even-numbered membership.\"\nHe added: \"And yet in this sweeping legislation which our Democratic friends keep characterizing as a voting rights bill, they go out of their way to make the FEC partisan...\u00a0The exact outcome that was originally feared -- the regulator of our Democracy becoming controlled by one side would be hardwired into the rules entirely by design.\u00a0This is so plainly unfair, so plainly an attempt to stack the deck, that I'm not really sure what more needs to be said.\"\nCommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., hit back against McConnell's argument, emphasizing that the Democrats' bill limits the members in each party on the commission to two, \"so no one party can take over the commission.\"\n\"Right now we have a dysfunctional Federal Election Commission. Everyone knows that,\" she also said. \"Hundreds of enforcement cases have languished in the past few years...\u00a0The FEC has not enacted any new disclosure rules after Citizens United. It can't even agree to hire a permanent general counsel.\"\n\n      Sen.

Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, meanwhile, suggested to McConnell that the limit of two FEC commissioners in\u00a0each party should alleviate his concerns.\u00a0\n\"I think any president with an ounce of sense can figure out somebody who can appear to be independent who's actually on their side,\" the minority leader retorted.\u00a0\nKlobuchar, however, noted that \"if there is a Republican president they would be appointing when terms end their own person.\"\nIn response to the gridlock argument, McConnell compared the FEC to the Senate Ethics Committee, which requires a bipartisan vote to move forward on a matter. He said that this high threshold for action is exactly the point of the FEC's design.\u00a0\n\"The FEC is not dysfunctional at all,\" McConnell said. Wanting an FEC that moves quickly on a variety of matters \"presumes that somehow you want an activist FEC frequently interfering in election contests...\u00a0I mean the whole notion that failure to act is dysfunctional when we're talking about fundamental first amendment free speech rights, I don't think there's any dysfunction at all.\"\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, meanwhile said that how senators voted on McConnell's amendment would be \"revealing.\"\u00a0\n\n      Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, leaves a Senate Republican Conference luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 24, 2021.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n      \n\n\n\"It's a sorting vote. Because anyone who votes against this amendment is admitting to the game,\" Cruz said. The bill without the McConnell amendment, Cruz said, \"turns the Federal Election Commission from what it has been for 50 years... into a partisan agency that would predictably be used to persecute, target and attack whichever party is out of power.\"\nCruz added: \"Any senator on this committee who votes against this amendment cannot pretend this bill is about voting rights... because it makes clear that the only objective of this bill is to ensure Democrats stay in power and to target the political opposition.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nS. 1 and H.R. 1, officially titled the \"For the People Act,\"\u00a0would also\u00a0ban\u00a0states from requiring photo ID\u00a0to vote; raise\u00a0barriers for states to clear voter rolls; require\u00a0states to offer drop boxes for 45 days before an election, and much more.\u00a0\nIt's unlikely that the For the People Act\u00a0will pass the Senate in its current form, given the unified GOP opposition. Democrats would have to get rid of the legislative filibuster to pass it without Republican votes and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he wouldn't do that under any circumstances.\u00a0\nIt is possible that Democrats may try to break up S. 1 into multiple bills to get GOP votes for at least some of the provisions. But it's not clear that they are committed to that approach or what its chances of success would be.",

    "body": "The problem, she rightly noted, is not limited to the disgraced former president. As she said in the closed-door conference meeting on Wednesday where she was ousted from her House leadership position: \u201cIf you want leaders who will enable and spread his destructive lies, I'm not your person, you have plenty of others to choose from. That will be their legacy.\u201d Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right That is an indictment of those who voted against her, not simply of the leader of their cult. She is telling the United States that the vast majority of House Republicans are liars, unfit to serve. And that poses some interesting questions: Will Cheney support primary challenges to MAGA House and Senate Republicans? Will she support independent conservatives in the general election? Will she run for president in 2024? Will she oppose the former president's sycophants (e.g., Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri or Ted Cruz of Texas) if they run for president? If a MAGA Republican, other than the former president gets their party's nomination in 2024, would she support that person? Would she support a third-party candidate? Does a conscientious Republican stay in the party and vote for Cheney Republicans? Or do they follow the more than 100 Never Trumper Republicans who are threatening to form a third party? Does the most egregious instance of \u201ccancel culture\u201d \u2014 Cheney's removal for speaking her mind \u2014 complicate the GOP's favorite amorphous talking point? It is easy to say that anti-MAGA Republicans should let a thousand flowers bloom; some should leave, and some should stand with Cheney to essentially level the existing GOP. But in a fundamental sense, the two strategies are incompatible. If the sane, patriotic and truth-telling Republicans leave the GOP, the pool of voters who support Cheney and like-minded, pro-democracy Republicans shrinks. And if Cheney succeeds in retaining her seat in the House, the rationale for a third party, at least one based on center-right positions, would likely crumble. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement In the short run, Cheney Republicans and other dissenters can unite around common values and goals: Speak out against the MAGA cult leader and the \u201cbig lie\u201d that the election was stolen; push for an independent Jan. 6 commission; support resources and focus on white supremacist violence. Other issues are trickier. It is unclear, for example, if Cheney will oppose voter suppression legislation that rests on the \u201cbig lie.\u201d She should understand that claims of fraud are specious and that the real aim of such legislation is voter suppression and the creation of circumstances in which MAGA Republicans can change the outcome of an election. Logically, that means she should oppose those efforts and support reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act's preclearance provision and some portions of H.R. 1, as other dissident Republicans support doing But Cheney has made clear she is not going to support campaign financing, as included in H.R. 1, so that leaves a key question: When it comes to support for democracy, isn't opposition to voter suppression essential? Cheney will need to decide where she stands. Finally, Cheney's staunch conservatism is, on the one hand, her great strength in beating back MAGA Republicans. She cannot be written off as a RINO. Nevertheless, it does limit her own appeal with the center-right, which may be inclined to keep migrating toward Democratic centrists who support anti-climate change measures, cracking down on corporate tax scofflaws, adopting an internationalist but less hard-power based foreign policy, etc. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Those types of debates \u2014 good old-fashioned policy arguments \u2014 are down the road. For now, Democrats, independents and non-MAGA Republicans of all stripes can cheer Cheney and her effort to level the party of sniveling cowards who remain in the thrall of the insurrectionist in chief.

    "body": "The House will vote on H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California. It would provide a pathway to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as \"Dreamers\" as well as for Temporary Protected Status recipients and Deferred Enforced Departure beneficiaries. The legislation stands to make up to 4.4 million individuals eligible for permanent residence, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe House is also slated to vote on H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, bipartisan legislation from Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington. The bill would permit farm workers, and their spouses and children, to earn legal status through continued employment in the agricultural sector, and would make changes to the H-2A agricultural guest worker program.\n\nBoth of these bills have already been passed by the House in previous years but are being voted on again with Democrats holding slim majorities in the House and Senate. They're both expected to pass the House again but hit a wall in the Senate.\n\nThe chances of these bills getting enough Republican support to reach 60 votes in the Senate is very low, renewing debate among Democrats about ending the filibuster. That would allow legislation to pass with a lower vote threshold, but also appears unlikely to happen.\n\nDemocrats are facing increasing scrutiny over their handling of immigration amid a recent surge in border crossings that Republicans have argued is a serious crisis. Biden tells migrants not to come to US: 'Don't leave your town' House Republicans have been hitting the Biden administration on the influx of migrants crossing the border in recent weeks, including the large increase in unaccompanied minors making the trek into the United States. Many of those migrants crossing the border have said they believe the Biden administration will be more welcoming than the Trump administration, which had adopted a more hardline posture. \"It's more than a crisis. This is a human heartbreak,\" House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said at a news briefing on a trip to the border this week. \"The sad part about all this, it didn't have to happen. This crisis is created by the presidential policies of this new administration. There's no other way to claim it than a Biden border crisis.\" The push to pass these two bills will give House Democrats an opportunity to say they are working to advance immigration reforms, but questions remain over the fate of broader efforts to overhaul the nation's immigration system. And while some progressive Democrats would have liked to see comprehensive immigration reform legislation rather than these two piecemeal bills, other Democrats have thrown cold water on the idea, underscoring how much of an uphill climb it would be to pass a broader immigration package. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin told CNN earlier this week that he doesn't believe there's enough support in this Congress to pass a full-blown immigration bill with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants, a key pillar of Biden's immigration plan. \"I don't see a means for reaching that,\" the Illinois Democrat said. \"I want it. I think we are much more likely to deal with discrete elements.\" Weighing in on the House effort to move immigration bills, Durbin said, \"I think Speaker Pelosi has discovered that she doesn't have support for the comprehensive bill in the House,\" Durbin said. \"And it indicates where it is in the Senate as well.\"",

    "body": "Advocates for slavery reparations legislation acknowledge they do not know who should be eligible for compensation or how it would be financed, leave details to government commission\n\n\n\n\nThree advocates for slavery reparations legislation acknowledged that they do not know who should be eligible or how to finance compensation, with one supporter comparing American slavery reparations to those paid out by Germany after the Holocaust in World War II.\nIn separate sit-down interviews with Fox News, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C.; Wanika Fisher, a Maryland General Assembly delegate representing Prince George\u2019s County; and Nkechi Taifa, a member of the National African-American Reparations Commission, all voiced support for legislation to establish a commission to study reparations. But they offered few specifics when pressed on how they would implement such a compensation program.\u00a0\nReparations are an \"attempt to compensate for years of slavery, which put African Americans behind in wealth, education and almost everything else that White Americans experienced when they came to this country simply for being White,\" Norton told Fox News.\nCALIFORNIA TASK FORCE HOLDS FIRST MEETING TO STUDY REPARATIONS FOR SLAVE DESCENDANTS\nNorton co-sponsored H.R. 40, a federal bill that would establish a commission to study reparations but includes limited details.\n\"This bill was written correctly, without specifics, because, to be frank, no one knows what we\u2019re talking about, who exactly we\u2019re talking about, what form it should take,\" Norton said.\u00a0\n\"No one knows off the top of their head who would be eligible and why,\" Norton continued. \"And no one knows whether reparations is the appropriate remedy. That\u2019s what you need a commission for.\"\nTaifa, who has been active in the reparations advocacy community for decades, said \"the privilege that White people in [America] enjoy is called \u2018White skin privilege',\" and that White Americans have benefitted from \"a state and a social structure that is governed by White supremacy.\"\u00a0\nShe also agreed that a federal commission should decide reparations specifics.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s for a federally chartered commission to study all of the information, gather all of the evidence and make recommendations. They will make the recommendations as to who, what, when and where,\" Taifa said.\u00a0\nFisher, who also voiced support for H.R. 40, introduced her own bill in the state assembly that relies on a commission to determine specifics.\n\"The bill in Maryland would set up a commission to not just study it, but it's to actually come up with the way reparations would look and work in Maryland and to figure out who should sit on that board to actually then execute reparations to descendants of Maryland slaves,\" said Fisher, who was elected to the General Assembly in 2018.\u00a0\nFisher said reparations can take shape in many different forms and listed various methods.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s obviously direct money payment \u2013 would be payment for basically lost wages and the fact that your descendants did work and were never paid and were obviously enslaved,\" Fisher told Fox News. Fisher said other options could include \"free tuition\" and \"the ability to take out loans without having to put down any sort of deposit or down payment.\"\nIn June, Robert Johnson, who founded Black Entertainment Television, put a $14 trillion price tag on reparations.\u00a0\nBut Taifa said no amount of compensation can make up for the damages caused by slavery.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s no question that Whites in this country enjoy the benefits of over 400 years of unjust enrichment,\" Taifa said. \"No amount of monetary damages could fully compensate for the atrocities of the enslavement era and everything that\u2019s happened since then.\"\nAmericans who believe they shouldn't be forced to pay for reparations because their ancestors either didn't own slaves or weren't in the U.S. during slavery should look to post-World War II Germany, Fisher suggested.\n\"When I look at Germany in their program, when it comes to the Holocaust there, there are tons of Germans that didn't do anything wrong to Jews that weren't, you know, Nazi sympathizers, weren't part of that, but they're paying into it and the German government to make things right,\" Fisher told Fox News.\nNorton, who has served as Washington, D.C.\u2019s lone delegate since 1991, said she supports funding reparations with taxpayer money.\n\"I would be for the money coming out of the Treasury, where everyone has been taxed, from corporations to individuals,\" Norton told Fox News.\nBut, not all Americans agree reparations are the best solution. Only 28% of White Americans support reparations, an April UMass/WCVB poll found.\n\"I don't think you're going to get White Americans to support reparations until we get this commission set up and people can find out what it's all about,\" Norton said of the polling during her interview with Fox News.\nCongress has previously approved financial payments for past wrongdoings perpetrated by the U.S. government. President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act in 1988, which gave reparations to Japanese Americans held in internment camps during World War II at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nFisher hinted that reparations, if approved, could be paid out for years to come.\n\"I think to heal what has gone on for slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, all of that, it's not going to be a year. I think it's going to be a long-term process because the damage was long-term.\"",

We would take .22-caliber target rifles to the National Guard armory shooting range. There we would learn firearm safety principles and basic rifle marksmanship skills.\n What was your most recent shooting sports/hunting activity? With whom?\n My most recent shooting activity was per my usual, target practice at my favorite indoor range. I have several friends who usually meet me there and we make a day of it.\n   Which piece of pending legislation related to the firearm industry or gun owners is particularly important to you and why?\n H.R. 127 is the most disturbing piece of federal legislation. It\u2019s basically the Weimar Republic gun registry that would set up the confiscation the despots are planning. The Executive Orders coming from Biden are VERY concerning as well. Here in N.C., our Republican-led legislature is moving forward with a bill to remove pistol purchase permit requirements. Currently these permits are issued by sheriffs. I truly believe restrictions on firearm ownership negatively affects law-abiding citizens much more than deter crime or criminals. Expanding restrictions across the nation will turn our entire country into Chicago.\n What do you see as the challenges and opportunities for hunters and shooting sports enthusiasts?\n The biggest challenge to the future of gun rights is the continuing false narratives and misinformation by leftist politicians and our mass media. It is up to us to push back and tell the truth.\n This interview was conducted by the team at the National Shooting Sports Foundation.",

    "body": "After a gunman killed 21 people at a Uvalde elementary school two weeks ago, Hearst Newspapers sent a survey to every Texas lawmaker, both at the state and congressional level, gauging their support for widely discussed gun control measures. The survey aimed to collect lawmakers' stances for the public record. We inquired about universal background checks, a ban on assault-style weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazines, raising the age to purchase an assault weapon from 18 to 21, and the so-called \"red flag\" laws that would temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others. We also asked whether lawmakers would support any additional safety policies, either related to firearms or not. Republicans hold every statewide office in Texas, control both chambers of the Texas Legislature and represent a majority of the state\u2019s congressional districts. Yet just one Republican \u2014 U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Houston \u2014 answered the survey. Related: 2021 was a study in how Texas Republicans quash gun control proposals after mass shootings State Rep. Dustin Burrows, the Lubbock Republican chairing the state House\u2019s new committee investigating the shooting, thanked us for the opportunity but said he would \u201cpass\u201d on the questionnaire. A representative for state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, referred us to his voting record. State Rep. Lyle Larson, a moderate Republican from San Antonio, did not fill out the form but said via email that he would support bipartisan talks on background checks and raising the age to purchase firearms. He also supports better training for local and state police and state funding for security and \"architectural changes\" at schools. On the Democratic side, there were 43 responses. Most of their answers were the same \u2014 straight \u201cyes\u201d answers to every question. But there were a few notable exceptions. Sen. Borris Miles of Houston, for example, said he would not support a full ban on assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines, but he said he would consider regulating both. Others offered similar nuance. State Rep. Terry Canales of Edinburg did not answer yes or no to the assault weapon ban but responded: \u201cI would need more information. For instance, is it a ban on future sales? What effect would it have on gun owners who already own these types of firearms? The question, in that respect, is incomplete.\u201d Related: After messy handling of Uvalde shooting, experts say even the fastest response can't outrun bullets To be sure, some legislators who did not answer this survey have spoken in other public forums about their stances on firearm restrictions. Generally, Democrats have endorsed most of these gun policies, while Republicans have shied away from such regulations to instead focus on mental health resources and school security measures. Please continue scrolling to read a sampling of lawmakers' responses. We have chosen five to feature online, but a full list is available in the document embedded below. U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston Red flag law: No Assault-style weapons ban: NoHigh-capacity magazine ban: NoRaise age to purchase assault-style weapons from 18 to 21: NoUniversal background checks: NoAdditional commentary on these policies: In response to the question on background checks, background checks already exist for virtually all gun sales from (Federal Firearm License) dealers, including at gun shows.In recent years, Republicans have taken meaningful steps to address gun violence.President Trump signed an executive order banning the sale of bump stocks, which is a device that increases the rate of fire on firearms. This was a concrete solution to address the tragic mass shooting that unfolded in Las Vegas in 2017.In 2018, the Fix NICS Act (P.L. 115-141), was signed into law by President Trump to strengthen the background check system. \u00a0The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is a critical tool to prevent disqualified individuals from purchasing a gun, and the Fix NICS Act has led to improvements in the system.During the 115th Congress, Republicans also passed the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act. This law aims to make our schools safer by providing resources to train students, teachers, and local law enforcement so they can help stop school violence before it happens. It also provides funding for technology and equipment to harden school security and stop attacks.Additional gun-related measures they'd support: Rep. Crenshaw cosponsored H.R.3252 - Federal Firearms Licensee Protection Act. Under current law, it is unlawful to steal a firearm from a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer, or from their business premises. This bill broadens the scope of unlawful conduct to also prohibit stealing a firearm from a gun range that rents firearms or a shooting club. An attempt to commit an offense is subject to the same penalties as a substantive offense. The bill modifies these penalties by increasing the maximum prison term.Additional school safety policies they'd support: Rep. Crenshaw introduced H.R. 7241 - Community Mental Health Services Block Grant Reauthorization Act, to reauthorize the program to allow states to better aid adults with serious mental illnesses and children with serious emotional disturbances. \u00a0The bill also allows states the flexibility to deliver targeted solutions outside of the one-size-fits-all methodology of Washington, D.C. to treat our mental health crisis. This bill recently advanced through the Energy and Commerce Committee to the full House of Representatives.\u00a0 Rep. Crenshaw co-sponsored H.R. 1518 - 21st Century NICS Act, which allows the FBI to access the N-Dex system when performing a background check under NICS for the potential sale of a firearm. This database aggregates criminal records from various local, state, and federal agencies to provide critical information to the criminal justice community. It contains incident, arrest, and booking reports; pretrial investigations; supervised released reports; calls for service; photos; and field contact/identification records. \u00a0According to FBI data, there are approximately 3,000 improper gun sales a year to people who are already legally prohibited from owning a gun. Had it been enacted; this bill may have prevented the Charleston shooting. U.S. Rep. Al Green, D-Houston Red flag law: YesAssault-style weapons ban: YesHigh-capacity magazine ban: YesRaise age to purchase assault-style weapons from 18 to 21: YesUniversal background checks: YesAdditional commentary on these policies: As to the above questions, because I support the right to bear arms with constitutional limitations; I support the right to legally use traditional hunting rifles and handguns; I support banning assault weapons and high capacity-magazines; and I support red flag laws with due process.Additional gun-related measures they'd support: Some additional legislative policies that I would support include the following: Require a waiting period prior to the purchase of a weapon with some exceptions. The banning of bump stocks. The repeal of special immunity from liability laws enjoyed by the gun industry. Requiring licensing before the purchase of a firearm with training to include anger management and dispute resolution, as well as safe storage methods. The funding of a national summer youth job program with a dispute resolution and anger management component. Fully fund gun violence prevention research through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Close the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d which allows a person to purchase a weapon from a private seller at a gun show without a background check. Additional school safety policies they'd support: In addition to securing the school facility itself with technology and properly trained security personnel, as well as active shooter response training, there are other things which can be done to improve our school safety. This is why I am a cosponsor of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s legislation H.R.5428, the School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act. This bill directs the Department of Education, in consultation with the Departments of Justice, and Health and Human Services, to annually report on indicators of school safety for each school shooting. This includes statistics on school shootings, such as the number of shootings, number of people killed, demographics of shooters and victims, the motivation of shooters, types of firearms and ammunition used, how the firearm was acquired, and more; and safety and prevention, such as building designs, and communication and response plans.I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 6538, The Active Shooter Alert Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives David Cicilline and Fred Upton. This bill will create a program similar to the AMBER Alert system for law enforcement to alert the public of active shooters in their community. It is a common-sense piece of legislation that could save lives across our communities. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio Red flag law: YesAssault-style weapons ban: YesHigh-capacity magazine ban: YesRaise age to purchase assault-style weapons from 18 to 21: YesUniversal background checks: YesAdditional commentary on these policies: You can't buy handguns before the age of 21. That change was made for a reason \u2014 to prevent negligent or violent incidents with guns. As a health measure, we raised the age required to buy cigarettes to 21. At the very least we can raise the age to purchase a semi-automatic rifle to the age of 21.Additional gun-related measures they'd support: We need to instill a \"cooling off\" period, where if someone tries to buy too many guns or too much ammunition in a short span of time, they are denied the purchase and told to come back several days later for a purchase. There are too many bad actors out there who have a bad day, go stockpile guns and ammo, and unleash their anger on innocent victims.Additional school safety policies they'd support: First of all, we need to fully fund public education and mental health in Texas. Full stop. Schools do not have the resources and therefore the ability to make sure that kids are mentally well and looked after. When looking at the Uvalde shooter, it's clear that someone should have flagged him for some sort of mental assistance. You have a teenager with alleged anger issues, who is into decapitating cats and picking fights, who was then allowed to purchase multiple guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition unfettered. This is a systematic failure and this event could have possibly never happened if the school system had the resources to assess and correct these issues with students. State Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo Red flag law: YesAssault-style weapons ban: Left blankHigh-capacity magazine ban: Left blankRaise age to purchase assault-style weapons from 18 to 21: YesUniversal background checks: YesAdditional commentary on these policies: I would support banning assault weapons for anyone younger than 21, who failed a background check or refused to abide by a \u201ccooling-off\u201d period; and would consider other reasonable restrictions.I would support a ban on high-capacity magazines but consider compelling reasons for exceptions.Additional gun-related measures they'd support: As vice chair of the Committee on Mass Violence Prevention and Community Safety, I developed recommendations to prevent future tragedies. They included limiting the sale of guns and ammunition to minors, implementing red flag laws and narrowing the definition of private sales of firearms to increase the number of purchases subject to a background check. I also would support requiring a \u201ccooling-off\u201d period for the purchase of a firearm.Although legislative support for many of these proposals is lacking, I remain optimistic that we can find consensus in this area. We need to focus on areas of agreement so that we can make immediate progress. The goal should not be to take away the guns of law-abiding citizens, but to implement reasonable restrictions that save lives.Additional school safety policies they'd support: Improving mental health care for students, preventing bullying and strengthening reporting mechanisms are critical to intercepting bad actors before it's too late. Students who exhibit alarming behaviors should receive the same care, compassion and love we extend to all our students. Fostering a nurturing and safe environment where students can access mental health resources could prevent more tragedies from occurring in the future.What's more, we must ensure direct access to classrooms and other learning sites on campus cannot be accessed directly or easily, including by re-imagining the construction of safe schools for the future. It's our job to keep our students safe. State Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie Red flag law: YesAssault-style weapons ban: YesHigh-capacity magazine ban: YesRaise age to purchase assault-style weapons from 18 to 21: YesUniversal background checks: YesAdditional commentary on these policies: These are common-sense measures that most Texans support. Three years ago, a horrific shooting happened in a Walmart in El Paso. Sixty-three House Democrats responded by asking Gov. Abbott to call a special session and immediately pass necessary, common-sense gun safety legislation.The governor ignored our call for action, and instead of prioritizing public safety, Abbott made it easier than ever for anyone anywhere to get a gun \u2014 without training, without licensing and without a background check.Texas House Democrats remain ready to debate and pass common-sense gun safety legislation. During the 87th Regular Session, Texas House Democrats filed over 50 bills that would address this crisis. But the Republicans in charge of our state for the last two decades have refused to support meaningful reforms.Additional gun-related measures they'd support: Requiring stolen guns to be reported to law enforcement. If assault weapons are not banned, prohibit them from being openly carried.Additional school safety policies they'd support: In general, funding for public schools should be increased to support increased educational quality, which includes ensuring a safe learning environment and providing adequate counseling services for students.",

Marsha Blackburn slammed the Democrats\u2019 sweeping election reform bill, saying the left \"has launched an assault on having free and fair elections,\" warning ahead of the vote Tuesday that it will be \"difficult\" for Republicans to get on board.\n\"They are advocating policies that are going to result in removing the ability of state and counties to manage their own elections,\" Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Tuesday.\nLIBERAL DARK MONEY GROUP LAUNCHES ADS TARGETING SINEMA, MANCHIN TO SUPPORT S1 ELECTION BILL\n\"One of the issues we have is the way local election officials have responded to this,\" Blackburn explained. \"The bill is taking away their ability to run those elections.\"\u00a0\nBlackburn told Fox News that prior to being elected to the Senate, and the Tennessee State Senate, she served on Williamson County's election commission.\u00a0\n\"That is something you take as a very, very serious opportunity because it is your responsibility to be certain those rolls are cleaned up, be certain volunteers and poll workers and properly trained, that everyone knows the rules, and that ballots are counted and resulted and made available, and that it is all done in a transparent manner,\" Blackburn said.\u00a0\nShe added: \"One person, one vote. Every legal vote to be counted. Those are the foundation for our electoral process.\"\u00a0\nBlackburn noted that \"the more people know about this bill, the less they like it.\"\u00a0\nThe For the People Act, also known as S.1, is the largest overhaul of U.S. election law in at least a generation and covers many aspects of the voting process, including requiring states to automatically register eligible voters and offer same-day voter registration.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe bill would massively expand the role of the federal government in how states run their elections. It also requires states to offer 15 days of early voting and allows no-excuse absentee balloting, which 14 states would have to implement. The states that already allow it would have to conform to S.1\u2019s standards.\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a moderate Democrat, said over the weekend he would vote against his colleagues on the legislation, calling the measure too partisan.\u00a0\n\"It's the wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together and unite our country, and I'm not supporting that because I think it would divide us more. I don't want to be in a country that's divided any further,\" Manchin said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nManchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., another moderate Democrat, are facing pressure to support the voting reform bill.\u00a0\nThe House of Representatives passed the House version of the legislation, H.R. 1, in March by a vote of 220 to 210. No Republicans joined with Democrats in approving the sweeping voter rights reform.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE \u2013\u00a0A conservative advocacy group that backs Republican causes is going up in over 40 congressional districts controlled by House Democrats with a major ad blitz targeting a bill that aims to regulate and lower prescription drug prices, describing the plan as \"Nancy Pelosi's socialist drug takeover plan.\"\nThe American Action Network on Thursday is unveiling a new issue advocacy campaign in 43 House districts to stop what it calls the House speaker's \"dangerous plan,\" which the group argues could mean fewer cures for life-threatening diseases and less access to breakthrough new treatments, like the COVID-19 vaccines.\nAMERICAN ACTION NETWORK TAKES AIM AT HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER COURT PACKING\nAmerican Action Network says it will spend more than $4 million to run the commercials, which were shared first with Fox News, on TV in 12 districts. Digital ads will go up in 31 other districts, and the group says it plans to make calls across all 43 districts.\n\"What's a life worth? Who gets to decide? Nancy Pelosi thinks the government does,\" the announcer in the spot says.\nThe announcer charges that \"under Pelosi's socialist drug takeover plan, Washington controls the prescription drug market. That means fewer breakthrough cures and less innovation, like the COVID vaccine. With Washington in charge, maybe the life-saving medicine you need still gets made. Or maybe it doesn't.\"\nThe announce then urges viewers to call the House Democrat in their district and urge the lawmaker \"to stop Pelosi\u2019s socialist drug takeover plan.\"\nHouse Democrats in December 2019 passed H.R. 3, which was known as the \"Lower Drug Costs Now Act.\"\nDEMOCRATS URGE BIDEN TO EXPAND MEDICARE IN NEXT SPENDING BILL\u00a0\nAiming to lower skyrocketing prescription drug prices, the bill would give Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies. It would also make the lower drug prices negotiated by Medicare available to Americans with private insurance,\u00a0not just Medicare beneficiaries.\u00a0Democrats said their measure, which was opposed by Republicans and the pharmaceutical industry, would also\u00a0\"stop drug companies ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the same drugs.\"\nThe bill died in the Senate, which was controlled by the GOP at the time. But Democrats campaigned on the issue during the 2020 elections.\nLast week, President Biden urged Congress to include major elements of the bill in his massive jobs and infrastructure proposal that he\u2019s trying to pass through the House and Senate. House Democrats are beginning the process of assembling the overall package.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO CUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\nAmerican Action Network President Dan Conston noted that \"breakthrough American innovation is giving us the tools to end this pandemic and get our lives back to normal.\"\nBut he said that \"nevertheless, Pelosi is pushing a socialist takeover of the prescription drug industry that will reduce access to lifesaving medications, cancel new cures for the patients who need them and send American innovation overseas.\"\nPointing to a GOP-authored alternative that\u2019s being showcased as bipartisan, Conston urged that \"liberals in Congress should abandon this radical plan and take up bipartisan reforms like H.R. 19 that will\u00a0reduce the cost of prescriptions without threatening access to the medicine patients need.\"\nThe TV ads will run in the districts of 12 House Democrats who could potentially face difficult reelections next year, when their party hopes to hold its razor-thin majority in the chamber.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0\nThe lawmakers are Reps.

    "body": "A majority of voters are less likely to vote for Democrats who support policies advanced in the far-left H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a February survey by the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s (NRCC) found.\n\nAccording to the survey, 78 percent of voters are \u201cless likely to vote for a Democrat who voted to allow candidates running for Congress to give themselves up to $5 million of public funds to pay for their political campaigns.\u201d The reference parallels\u00a0agenda items outlined in H.R. 1, which the Democrat-led House passed last week.\n\nThe bill would largely result in the federalization of U.S. elections, axing many states\u2019 individual election procedures including basic voter ID laws and management of voter rolls.\n\nTwenty state attorneys general, led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R), wrote a letter to Senate and House leadership warning the legislation \u201cimplicates the Electors Clause\u201d by regulating the elections for president and vice president. It also faces other major \u201cconstitutional hurdles,\u201d they warned, due to its \u201cregulation of congressional elections, including by mandating mail-in voting, requiring states to accept late ballots, overriding state voter identification (\u2018ID\u2019) laws, and mandating that states conduct redistricting through unelected commissions.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also provides public funds for qualifying political campaigns at the congressional and presidential levels.\n\n\u201cThe 6:1\u00a0match would kick in for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200. For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400,\u201d Fox News reported:\n\nThe program would begin in the 2028 election cycle and would\u00a0be voluntary. Candidates would opt in\u00a0by meeting donation qualifications and would be subject to certain contribution limits. Backers of the bill say this small-dollar match program is the anecdote[sic] to getting big money and corporate interests out of elections and to allow candidates to focus on garnering support from their neighbors\u00a0rather than catering to high-dollar donor fundraisers and special interests.\n\nThe provision has sparked an outcry from conservatives who say taxpayer money should not be used to fund political campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a D.C. takeover of our elections,\u201d Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) told Breitbart News last month. \u201cThis actually has tax dollars that will pay for politicians\u2019 campaigns. It\u2019s disgusting.\u00a0 No tax dollar should go to a campaign.\u201d\n\nThe House successfully passed the measure last week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) heaped praise on the measure, describing it as a means to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d on Democrat priorities.\n\nWhat\u2019s exciting about it is it restores confidence that people have that their vote and their voice is as important as anyone\u2019s. That yes. We can address the climate crisis if big, dark special interest money is not suffocating the airwaves with misinformation about how to protect the planet. We yes can have background checks passed in the whole Congress of the United States to protect our children if big, dark special interest gun lobbying money is not suffocating the airwaves. And yes, we can have lower cost of prescription drugs. The list goes on and on. We can \u2018Build Back Better\u2019 for the people in every zip code as we said in our caucus yesterday.\n\nThe NRCC survey also found 62 percent of voters are less likely to vote for a Democrat who voted to ban states from implementing basic voter ID laws.",

    "body": "CNN\n      \u2014 \u00a0\n\n\n\n  \n  Here is a look at the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Considered the nation\u2019s most important civil rights legislation since Reconstruction (1865-1877), it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. Following that law, US President Lyndon B. Johnson signed landmark civil rights bills including the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing Act. \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \u201cEach year, from 1945 until 1957, Congress considered and failed to pass a civil rights bill. Congress finally passed limited Civil Rights Acts in 1957 and 1960, but they offered only moderate gains. As a result of the 1957 Act, the United States Commission on Civil Rights was formed to investigate, report on, and make recommendations to the President concerning civil rights issues.\u201d - National Park Service\n\n\n\n  \n  The act had the longest filibuster in US Senate history, and after the long civil rights struggle, the Senate passed the act 73-27 in July 1964. It became law less than a year after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\n\n\n  \n  More Republicans voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act than Democrats.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  June 11, 1963 - US President John F. Kennedy asking Congress to enact civil rights legislation during his Radio and Television Report to the American People on Civil Rights. \n\n\n\n  \n  June 19, 1963 - Kennedy sends his comprehensive proposal for the Civil Rights Act to the US Congress for consideration. The bill, H.R. 7152, is introduced the following day.\n\n\n\n  \n  June 26, 1963 - US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy speaks before the House Committee of the Judiciary in support of H.R. 7152.\n\n\n\n  \n  October 15, 1963 - Robert Kennedy testifies for the second time before the House Judiciary Committee to try to save the bill.\n\n\n\n  \n  November 20, 1963 - A version of the bill passes from the House Judiciary Committee on to the House Rules Committee.\n\n\n\n  \n  November 22, 1963 - Lee Harvey Oswald assassinates Kennedy. Lyndon B. Johnson is sworn-in as president.\n\n\n\n  \n  November 27, 1963 - Johnson speaks before a joint session of Congress, \u201cNo memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy\u2019s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\u201d\n\n\n\n  \n  December 1963 - The House adjourns with the bill still in committee.\n\n\n\n  \n  January 1964 - The House Rules Committee debates the bill.\n\n\n\n  \n  February 10, 1964 - The bill passes the House.\n\n\n\n  \n  February 17, 1964 - The bill arrives in the Senate.\n\n\n\n  \n  March 30, 1964-June 10, 1964 - The Senate debates the bill for 60 working days, including seven Saturdays, with many attempts to filibuster the bill. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary is not involved.\n\n\n\n  \n  June 9-10, 1964 - US Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia filibusters the bill for 14 hours and 13 minutes before the Senate votes 71 to 29 to cloture the bill. A motion to cloture forces an immediate vote. This vote by two-thirds or more brings all debate to an end. \n\n\n\n  \n  June 19, 1964 - In a 73 to 27 vote, the Senate adopts an amended bill, which is sent back to the House.\n\n\n\n  \n  June 21, 1964 - Three young men volunteering for the voter registration drive, \u201cFreedom Summer,\u201d disappear in segregated Mississippi. Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Earl Chaney were driving to a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) office in Meridian, Mississippi, that evening. This leads to a national outcry, protests and an FBI investigation.\n\n\n\n  \n  July 2, 1964 - The House of Representatives adopts the Senate version of the bill 289-126.\n\n\n\n  \n  July 2, 1964 - Johnson signs the bill into law.\n\n\n\n  \n  August 4, 1964 - The FBI finds the bodies of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi. They had been shot and buried beneath a dam.\n\n\n\n  \n  December 14, 1964 - The Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of the act in the interstate commerce case Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States. The case, initiated by an Atlanta motel seeking to discriminate among its customers based on race, proves to be a major test of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\n\n  \n  June 15, 2020 - The US Supreme Court rules that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination against LGBTQ employees, after consolidated cases were brought on behalf of two gay men fired from their jobs, as a skydiving instructor and a child welfare services coordinator, and on behalf of a transgender woman who lost her position as a funeral home director.",

    "body": "Bloomberg editors raised a fair point in early March by\u00a0cautioning that banks should not be brought into culture wars. The editors gnashed their teeth that banks are being pressured by politicians on both sides of the aisle to pick winners and losers in the American economy.\n\nThey are right about the need for lending institutions to stay above the fray. They are also wrong to think that anyone dragged banks into the public policy arena. They marched into the fray to the drumbeat of the \u201cwoke\u201d band cheering them on.\n\nEnding the blatant discrimination against a Constitutionally-protected industry, such as the firearm industry, is a matter of ensuring that ivory-tower, unaccountable corporate boardroom executives do not dictate which rights Americans choose to exercise. Discrimination against the firearm industry is a conscious decision by these corporate entities to slowly choke off American firearm manufacturing, and with it the Second Amendment.\n\nThis is how they plan to exact gun control through corporate fiat. Eliminating the industry that produces firearms for law-abiding Americans means Americans can\u2019t exercise their Second Amendment rights.\n\nBanks, and news editors, must be honest. This is a fight the banks started, and they can choose to end it immediately. They only need to drop business demands for gun control that exceeds federal and state law. It is not for banks to dictate public policy, especially when it comes to Constitutional rights.\n\nBank of America announced in 2018 that they would no longer conduct business with firearm manufacturers producing Modern Sporting Rifles (MSRs), or AR-15-style rifles, vilifying the most-popular selling rifle in America as \u201cmilitary-style\u201d firearms for civilians. Bank of America\u2019s then-vice chairman Anne Finucane made the announcement on Bloomberg TV. That is something that Bloomberg editors failed to note. They missed it again when their own reporters reported it less than a year ago.\n\nCitigroup, too, enacted discriminatory firearm policies more than a decade ago. The banking giant stepped up their discrimination in 2018, refusing to do business with anyone who did not agree to age-based gun bans that would deny Second Amendment rights to adults under 21, or those who sell standard-capacity magazines. Federal law allows adults at 18 to purchase rifles and shotguns.\n\nBloomberg news reported on this in 2018. They also reported that Citigroup attested to the Texas Attorney General that they do not hold discriminatory policies against the firearm industry, despite the fact that their discriminatory policies are still posted on their website. Another miss by Bloomberg\u2019s editors.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon testified before Congress that the banking giant does not work with any business manufacturing AR-15-style rifles, maligning them as \u201cmilitary-style weapons for civilian use.\u201d That was enough for Louisiana\u2019s Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry and Republican state Treasurer John Schroeder to bar JPMorgan Chase from competing for state bonds. \u201cI\u2019m not selling our 2nd Amendment rights to corporate America,\u201d said Treasurer Schroder. And Attorney General Landry recently told his fellow Republican attorneys general at their January meeting, \u201cThe Second Amendment is not for sale.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo once stayed out of the \u201cwoke\u201d banking cabal. However, just two months after Wells Fargo and other banks got \u201cfailing grades\u201d from gun control radicals Guns Down America, CEO Charles Scharf reported the bank\u2019s relationship with the NRA was \u201cdeclining,\u201d adding the bank would no longer participate in line of credit or mortgage commitments. Wells Fargo has terminated banking relationships with several major firearm manufacturers because they refused the bank\u2019s demand that they stop manufacturing Modern Sporting Rifles.\n\nBloomberg news reported on the \u201cfailing grades\u201d at the time. That, too, was skipped by the editors.\n\nThe firearm industry is not fighting alone. Political leaders witnessed corporate banks\u2019 demands. Texas enacted the Firearm Industry Nondiscrimination (FIND) Act, which tells these corporate banks that they cannot profit from Texas tax dollars and use those profits to fund efforts to deny those Texans their Second Amendment rights.\n\nSimilar legislation is pending in eight states. It has also been introduced in Congress by Rep. Jack Bergman (R-MI) as H.R. 6970. That is in addition to the Fair Access to Banking Act (S. 563/H.R. 1729), introduced by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) respectively. These bills would ensure that banking and credit decisions are based on objective, individualized credit worthiness and impartial risk-based standards. It would also prevent multinational financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets from accessing taxpayer-subsidized government programs, including access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window Lending Programs, Federal Deposit Insurance Company, and Automated Clearing House Network, if they are at the same time denying banking services to legal businesses under federal law.\n\nNone of these bills, nor Texas\u2019s law, tells the banks they must do business with the firearm industry. Corporate banks are free to hold discriminatory policies should they choose. However, the FIND Acts would give states, and the Federal government, the same freedom to choose with whom they conduct business, especially when it means funding banks bent on destroying Second Amendment rights. The Fair Access to Banking Act only tells these corporate banks they cannot access taxpayer-funded insurances while at the same time destroying the taxpayers\u2019 Constitutional rights.\n\nBanks should assess their business decisions based on credit worthiness, not \u201cwoke\u201d political agendas. This is not a fight the firearm industry chose, but one thrust upon the industry when banks decided to choose winners and losers based on activist political agendas.\n\nLawrence G.

So it\u2019s quite a spectacle to see them actively spreading the left\u2019s own big lie about elections.\n\nAccording to Delta CEO Ed Bastian, there is only one reason Georgia passed a voting reform: to suppress the votes of black Americans and other minorities. Georgia\u2019s Republican Legislature used the \u201cexcuse\u201d of voter fraud to \u201cmake it harder for many underrepresented voters\u201d to \u201cexercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives,\u201d Mr. Bastian wrote this week in a memo to employees.\n\nMr. Bastian has plenty of company in the C-suites.

    "body": "Hollywood filmmaker Rob Reiner is once again equating Republicans with racism, making the unsubstantiated claim that the GOP stands \u201cfor nothing except white nationalism.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, The Princess Bride filmmaker attacked Republicans as \u201csecessionists\u201d who \u201crefuse to govern,\u201d saying it is up to Democrats to \u201chold our country together.\u201d\n\nReiner didn\u2019t elaborate on his comments but he appeared to be referring to the GOP-backed voter integrity laws in states including Georgia and Texas. Democrats have denounced the laws as racist and a form of voter suppression. Republicans say the laws are necessary to protect against voter fraud.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Reiner emerged as one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest backers of Joe Biden. The filmmaker promised Biden\u00a0would \u201crestore our souls and standing as leader of the free world.\u201d\n\nBut Biden hasn\u2019t made good on his promise to strengthen or unify the country. As Breitbart News reported, the president recently encouraged Major League Baseball to boycott Georgia by\u00a0moving its All-Star Game out of Atlanta over the state\u2019s voter integrity law.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Biden stoked division\u00a0claiming the country is suffering from \u201cracism, nativism, fear, and demonization.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration also implemented measures to vet\u00a0the National Guard soldiers at the inauguration for their political views.\n\nRob Reiner is among the numerous Hollywood elites pushing H.R. 1, the so-called For the People Act, which seeks to seize power from states to oversee their own election. The bill would also gut voter identification requirements and restore voting privileges to convicted felons.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter\u00a0@HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

    "body": "Biden has asked a 36-member commission (four times the number of justices!) to study \"the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform\" \u2014 including adding justices \u2014 so-called court-packing \u2014 or giving justices fixed terms. Moving legislation on the subject before the commission reported would have preempted the commission\u2019s work.But the debate over expanding the court will continue, and that\u2019s fine. Whether you support enlarging the Supreme Court or oppose it ( as I do ), it\u2019s worth scrutinizing the arguments for such a momentous change.Some arguments for court-packing are better than others. Let's take them in reverse order of seriousness.The easiest argument to dismiss is one that Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) cited in announcing the introduction of legislation to add four justices to the court: There should be 13 justices because there are now 13 U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal.A bit of explanation: Every Supreme Court justice is also a \"circuit justice\" for one or more of the federal appeals courts. A circuit justice receives emergency applications from his or her circuit, and often relays them to the entire court.In the 19th century, Nadler noted, there were nine justices and nine circuits. But now there are 13 circuits, meaning that some justices have to double up. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, for example, is responsible for both the 6th and 8th Circuits. (Justice Elena Kagan is the circuit justice for the humongous 9th Circuit, which includes California.)But being responsible for two circuits doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more work because different circuits can generate different numbers of emergency applications. In any event, Arthur Hellmann, an expert on federal courts at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, notes that the portion of justices\u2019 time taken up by their circuit duties is very small.Hellmann is equally unimpressed by another argument floated by Nadler: that a larger Supreme Court is necessary because of the proliferation of federal laws. Nadler said the nine justices were adequate in the 19th century when \u201cmany of our most important federal laws \u2014 covering everything from civil rights to antitrust, the internet, financial regulation, healthcare, immigration, and white collar crime \u2014 simply did not exist, and did not require adjudication by the Supreme Court.\"Now, he suggested, the court's workload is heavier. Therefore we need a larger court. Hellman, however, points out that in the 19th century the Supreme Court had to deal with many cases stemming from disputes arising in common law rather than federal statutes. The justices were plenty busy. Another, marginally more persuasive, argument is that expanding the court is justified payback for the Republicans \"stealing\" a Supreme Court from Democrats in 2016. That was the year in which then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to consider President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia\u2019s seat eventually went to Neil Gorsuch, a President Trump appointee. McConnell's behavior was outrageous, and Republicans added hypocrisy to injury when they confirmed another Trump appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, in 2020 after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Never mind McConnell\u2019s insistence after Scalia\u2019s death that in an election year the American people\"should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice.\"But even if you accept the fact that Republicans \u201cstole\u201d Garland\u2019s seat, that\u2019s still only one seat, and the proposed legislation would add four seats. (The idea that Republicans also stole the Ginsburg seat by confirming Barrett makes sense only if you insist that Supreme Court vacancies shouldn\u2019t be filled in an election year, which decidedly wasn\u2019t the Democrats\u2019 position in 2016.) Finally, there is one argument for court-packing that does invoke an important principle: that the court as currently constituted poses a threat to democracy, not just to Democratic Party priorities. Or, in the words of Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), another proponent of court enlargement:\"Our democracy is hanging by a thread. And the far-right majority on the U.S. Supreme Court is cutting it.\"Jones has also said that expanding the court is necessary to\"defeat Jim Crow.\"Even some who wouldn't echo that apocalyptic alarmism fear that the court might strike down a proposed new version of the Voting Rights Act and H.R. 1, the mammoth Democratic bill passed by the House that would allow wide use of mail-in ballots and set a minimum number of days for early voting, among other changes to election law. (That assumes, of course, that bill would pass the Senate.) Progressives are understandably haunted by the court's gutting of a key provision in the Voting Rights Act in a 2013 case called Shelby County vs. Holder. But even if you think that case was wrongly decided, it doesn't mean that the current court would invalidate provisions of H.R. 1 or the John Lewis Voting Rights Amendment Act, a companion piece of legislation that responds to the Shelby County ruling. Some of the requirements that H.R. 1 would impose on the states seem clearly justified by the text of the Constitution, which allows Congress to override decisions by state legislatures about the \"times, places and manner\" of congressional elections. As for the Voting Rights Act, it's important to remember what the court actually did in the Shelby County case. A 5-4 conservative majority ruled that Congress had used outdated data in deciding which states with a history of racial bias in voting had to \u201cpre-clear\u201d changes in their election practices with the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington, D.C. Yet that decision left the pre-clearance requirement intact and essentially invited Congress to come up with a new coverage formula more reflective of\"current conditions.\"That\u2019s just what the John Lewis Voting Voting Rights Advancement Act would do. If the court were to strike that down on a partisan vote, calls for enlarging the court would be more persuasive. But such a decision is far from foreordained. \u201cPack the court to save democracy\u201d is a more much appealing argument than \u201c13 justices for 13 circuits\u201d or \u201cAvenge Merrick Garland Times Four.\u201d But it\u2019s also premature. And, like the other arguments for court-packing, it must be weighed against the danger that a partisan enlargement of the court would reinforce the perception that the justices are just\"politicians in robes \"and tempt Republicans to add even more seats if they regained control of Congress and the White House.

    "body": "Available on: Xbox Series X and Series S, PC\n\nDeveloper: Ebb Software | Publisher: Kepler Interactive\n\nThe Swiss artist H.R. Giger is best known as the creator who gave the Alien franchise its iconic, eerie aesthetic. Giger mixed biology, machinery and erotic imagery to create the titular Alien creatures that the series is so well-known for. The Xenomorph is an enormous monster, designed to evoke primal familiarity with its phallic head and vaguely humanoid body, but also an unnerving foreignness because of its machine-like exoskeleton. That uncanny valley is what makes the Xenomorph feel so disturbingly, well, alien.\n\n\nBut Alien was never really about Giger\u2019s work. In fact, the film\u2019s most prominent themes are anything but alien: average laborers made to suffer for the unquenchable greed of megacorporations, fear of the unknown, the moral obligations of science and motherhood (Ripley and the Alien Queen are both, after all, mothers). These mundanely human topics are what made \u201cAlien\u201d such a groundbreaking sci-fi film when it was released in 1979. In a genre that was traditionally viewed from the lofty perspective of a Starfleet officer or a Jedi Knight, Alien was about truckers in space.\n\n\u201cScorn,\u201d a first-person horror game from Serbian developer Ebb Software and published by Kepler Interactive, is most definitely not about truckers in space. As I explored the nightmarish world of \u201cScorn,\u201d I felt like I was walking through a gallery of Giger\u2019s paintings with minimal loss in translation. It was a bizarre and sometimes breathtaking title. But some of the clumsy map design, phoned in combat mechanics and an especially intense set piece during the game\u2019s final act made me wish for a more focused, shorter journey \u2014 and even a more prominent trigger warning.\n\nOn \u201cScorn\u2019s\u201d Kickstarter page, Ebb described the concept behind the game as \u201cbeing thrown into the world.\u201d (This is likely a reference to German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who wrote about exactly that; \u201cScorn\u2019s\u201d original title was \u201cDasein,\u201d after Heidegger\u2019s existential concept of being.) You play as a hairless humanoid waking up in a grotesque but beautifully realized biomechanical world. Walls that look like taut sinew are girded with beams and rafters reminiscent of bones. Flaps of flaky, skinlike cloth hang in tatters from ceilings. Decrepit, skeletal machines are powered by gunmetal intestinal tracts, and controlled by consoles rippling with industrial blood vessels. The bleak landscapes and towering, imposing buildings are clearly a nod to the Polish artist Zdzislaw Beksi\u0144ski. Even the dust particles drifting in the smoky, dull light of eye-shaped lamps move in a way that feels unnatural.\n\nYour character enters \u201cScorn\u201d naked and ignorant, and as the player, you are no better off. The game sports a bare-bones UI that disappears when you\u2019re out of combat, and none of the creatures you encounter nor places you visit have names in-game. There is no dialogue, quest log, inventory or map. There are no obvious objectives to complete or goals to reach. The only thing you can do is move forward \u2014 in true existential fashion, because you can. The many puzzles you\u2019ll encounter can only be solved through trial and error. This minimalist approach is how \u201cScorn\u201d delivers on its concept of \u201cbeing thrown into the world.\u201d\n\nWithout notes or quest givers, I had to experiment my way through the game. As someone who sucks at puzzles, \u201cScorn\u201d was my Dark Souls. The puzzles in \u201cScorn\u201d are hard and many of them had me cursing at my monitor, wishing for walk-throughs that didn\u2019t exist yet. However, when I did eventually figure out the really tough puzzles, I got a cool sense of satisfaction. The solutions feel earned; they require you to be very observant and tinker with everything. Be prepared to travel back and forth a lot between areas, because sometimes a switch you pull will activate something somewhere else.\n\nUnfortunately, navigating \u201cScorn\u201d was also a real hassle. Eschewing a minimap is a perfectly respectable design decision, but it doesn\u2019t work when everything looks the same. For all of \u201cScorn\u2019s\u201d exquisite detail, there are several areas that look way too similar, which made it very easy to get lost as I was backtracking to solve puzzles. There\u2019s one specific hub in the game\u2019s third act that requires you to extend a passageway to four different tunnels. You have to travel through all four multiple times, and with no visual cues to tell them apart, I spend half my time in that section wandering aimlessly.\n\n\u201cScorn\u2019s\u201d combat is designed to be a struggle. You are a desperate survivor, not a soldier. The nameless machine-flesh weapons that the player character grafts onto their body resemble a pneumatic hammer, a shotgun, an even bigger shotgun and a grenade launcher. These weapons aren\u2019t very effective, reloading is slow and ammunition is scarce, leading to some unwieldy but tense fights. If you die, you\u2019ll be punished by \u201cScorn\u2019s\u201d unforgiving checkpoint system and forced to retread a significant amount of gameplay, unable to skip any of the game\u2019s lengthy puzzle animations. Once, the game crashed on me during a cutscene, costing me nearly an hour of progress. (Kepler told reviewers that a day one patch will address these bugs.)\n\nI understand what Ebb was going for and I appreciate feeling like the player character is entirely out of their element. For most of the game, it\u2019s even enjoyable. But it all culminated in an underwhelming boss fight that boiled down to me circle strafing around the big bad guy for five minutes until an opening appeared for me to get a single shot in. I had to repeat this six times. It was the sort of monotonous, artificial difficulty that took the game from being scary to feeling like a chore.\n\n\u201cScorn\u2019s\u201d gameplay trailers have properly portrayed it as a gory affair. Expect to see lots of guts being splattered and blood being spilled as your player character guns hostile abominations and sacrifices innocent beings to unlock new areas. Toward the end of the game, there are also lots of risque statues and landmarks clearly influenced by Giger\u2019s more erotic work. The game\u2019s description on Steam and the Microsoft Store make note of all this.\n\nBut there is one gruesome cutscene I can\u2019t describe fully in print. All I can say is that it involves extreme torture, mutilation and what I would argue is a form of sexual assault. The scene is unskippable and happens entirely in first person. I emailed Kepler about this and was sent a content warning screen that will be added to \u201cScorn\u201d before release, containing the usual disclaimers about epileptic seizures, violence, gore and \u201csensitive and adult themes.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m overanalyzing how brutal this scene could be for some people, but I don\u2019t think this general warning is enough of a heads up for what I played. Prospective players, be warned.\n\nI finished \u201cScorn\u201d wishing that there were things it did better, but also hoping that more games could learn from its finer points (unskippable torture scene aside). The combat is mediocre and arguably unnecessary, committing the cardinal \u201cintentionally clunky shooter\u201d sin of forcing a boring busywork boss fight on the player. The world was intriguingly creepy, but also uniform to the point of confusion. Still, I also wish there were more small titles like \u201cScorn\u201d that play out like one giant level with a clear, cohesive theme. In an age when games are trying to squeeze every possible achievement hunting minute out of us, I loved that \u201cScorn\u201d had zero collectibles to track down. It kept me immersed in the game\u2019s atmosphere instead of worrying about a trophy I might\u2019ve missed.\n\n\u201cScorn\u201d is an art house experience. I\u2019m sure that other reviewers will plumb \u201cScorn\u201d for its hidden high-minded commentary on the human condition, but for me, the appeal of the game is how it made me feel rather than think. I felt a constant, humming anxiety for simply existing in its macabre world. I was never particularly scared of anything I encountered; like the playable creature, I just wanted out.",

    "body": "Community Corner Immigrant Advocates In Colorado Call On Lawmakers To Update Registry Laws DENVER, Colo. \u2014 Edna Chavez's journey to the U.S. began almost 1,200 miles away in Guatemala. Reply\n\nMarch 13, 2023 DENVER, Colo. \u2014 Edna Chavez\u2019s journey to the U.S. began almost 1,200 miles away in Guatemala. Fearing for her life after she was nearly forced into prostitution at 17 years old, Chavez said her family told her to leave the country. So, she set her sights on the U.S. because she said the country represented exactly what she was looking for \u2014 freedom.\n\nHer first stop was in Mexico, where she worked on a cucumber farm for about a month to save up money to cross the border into Texas in 2018. She was granted asylum and lived in a youth shelter for seven months before she was adopted by a family in Colorado. Edna Chavez, who came to the U.S. as a minor from Guatemala and is now a student at Colorado State University, attended a rally organized by the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition on March 11, 2023, at the Colorado Capitol. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)\n\nNow, Chavez, 21, is a freshman at Colorado State University where she studies mathematics and applied sciences with the hopes of one day landing a job at NASA. But Chavez said she has also seen cases where other immigrants didn\u2019t receive the same support that she did. \u201cA lot of immigrants don\u2019t choose to come to the U.S., but are instead forced to come,\u201d Chavez told Colorado Newsline in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s time for politicians to protect us from exploitation, abuse in the workplace and racist policies that lead to family separation.\u201d\n\nChavez was one of dozens of immigrants and advocates from the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition who rallied at the state Capitol on Saturday. The group wants Colorado\u2019s congressional delegation to support a bill to update the U.S. registry law that allows undocumented immigrants to receive permanent resident status after being in the U.S. for at least seven years. Known as H.R. 8433, the bill would update the registry law to allow anyone who entered the country prior to January 2015 to apply for permanent residency. Currently, only people who entered the country before January 1972 can apply for this status, thereby making the law irrelevant to most undocumented immigrants who live in the U.S. today.\n\nH.R. 8433 was reintroduced in the House of Representatives on March 9 by Democratic Reps. Zoe Lofgren of California, Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda of Illinois, Grace Meng of New York, and Norma Torres and Lou Correa of California. Rep. Diana DeGette, who represents Denver, has signed on to the bill as an original sponsor. The group rallied to call on Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper to support a corresponding bill in the Senate. They also want Democratic Reps. Joe Neguse, Jason Crow, Brittany Petersen, and Yadira Caraveo to work with their Republican colleagues and pass the bill in the House. Dozens of activists and immigrants attended a rally organized by the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition on March 11, 2023, at the Colorado Capitol. Carlos Rojas addressed the crowd. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline) \u201cThis bill is a commonsense approach for people to receive permanent residency status year after year,\u201d Carlos Rojas, a labor and immigration organizer, said at the rally. \u201cAnd for the U.S. to actually be a nation that supports immigrants.\u201d Rojas added that updating the registry date will also give people who are granted permanent residency access to health care and retirement savings accounts. \"It could also provide legal protection from issues that many immigrants face, like wage theft,\" Rojas said.\n\nFor immigrants like Lupe Lopez, who came to the U.S. with her husband in 1998, getting permanent residency is an important step to keeping her family together. In September 2012, Lopez and her husband were arrested on Interstate 70 after being pulled over by a state trooper and presenting a Mexican driver\u2019s license. She said they spent four days in the ICE detention center in Aurora away from their five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Lopez said she and her family fought against deportation for almost a decade before they finally received residency status in 2022. \u201cThere are a lot of families who are going through this, and their only crime is trying to provide a better life for their children,\u201d Lopez said at the rally. Dozens of activists and immigrants attended a rally organized by the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition on March 11, 2023, at the Colorado Capitol. Some immigrants at the event shared their personal stories. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline) Despite the bill\u2019s benefits, Rojas knows that it faces an uphill battle now that Republicans control the House. Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has mirrored his caucus\u2019s hardline stance against immigration, and he told The Fresno Bee in February that he won\u2019t support any immigration reform bills until the U.S.-Mexico border is \u201csecure.\u201d",

The money will fund defensive military equipment and training, along with aid for Ukrainian refugees both within the country and in neighboring nations.\n\nWashington had to approve a spending plan by the end of the day to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday signed a $1.5 trillion bill that funds federal operations through September and sends billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine as the country fights off a Russian invasion.\n\n\"We're moving further to augment support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country,\" Biden said Tuesday before he signed the bill. He added that the U.S. will be \"better positioned to provide for the rapidly growing humanitarian need of the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBiden signed the bill shortly after the White House announced he would travel to Brussels this month for an extraordinary summit about Russia's attack on Ukraine. He also approved the funding hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's planned address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday morning.\n\nWhile the bill includes critical funding for U.S. efforts in Ukraine, it also stamps out some risks in the U.S. for now. The federal government will avoid a shutdown, which can damage the economy and put many federal employees out of work temporarily.\n\nThe bill provides enough money to cover federal spending through the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30 after Congress passed multiple stopgap plans to keep the lights on in recent months.\n\nLawmakers will have to approve another funding bill later this year as the midterm elections approach.\n\nThe funding legislation did not include $15.6 billion in supplemental coronavirus relief that was originally tucked into the plan. The White House has warned its efforts to curb and treat infections will suffer if Congress does not approve more aid.\n\nWhile the Democratic-held House could pass more pandemic relief money, Senate Republicans may block it from getting to Biden's desk.",

Brown (D-OH) and Collins (R-ME) and Reps. Blumenauer (D-OR) and LaHood (R-IL). Currently, nurse practitioners (NPs) treating Medicare patients in need of diabetic shoes must refer them to a physician who can certify that need. This legislation would allow patients to continue receiving care from their chosen health care provider by authorizing NPs to certify their patients' need for diabetic shoes.\n\nFor decades, nurse practitioners have demonstrated they provide high-quality health care to patients, including those with diabetes.\n\n\"This legislation would streamline health care delivery, ensuring that patients with diabetes receive the care they need when they need it \u2014 from their provider of choice,\" said AANP President April Kapu, DNP, APRN, ACNP-BC, FAANP, FCCM, FAAN. \"Patients should not have to endure outdated barriers to care that come between them and their health care provider. Requiring a physician to certify that a patient requires diabetic shoes \u2014 after the patient's NP has already made that determination \u2014 leads to delays in treatment and increases costs to the Medicare program by requiring the participation of an additional provider. We thank Senators Brown and Collins as well as Representatives Blumenauer and LaHood for their efforts and look forward to the passage of this legislation.\"\n\nUnder the Medicare program, NPs are authorized to be reimbursed for the treatment of patients with diabetes, yet they are not authorized to certify their patients' need for diabetic shoes. For decades, NPs have demonstrated that they provide high-quality health care to patients, including those with diabetes. Now is the time to remove this outdated practice barrier with legislation that streamlines the delivery of high-quality care and respects patient choice.\n\nThe American Association of Nurse Practitioners\u00ae (AANP) is the largest professional membership organization for nurse practitioners (NPs) of all specialties. It represents the interests of the more than 355,000 licensed NPs in the U.S. AANP provides legislative leadership at the local, state and national levels, advancing health policy; promoting excellence in practice, education and research; and establishing standards that best serve NPs' patients and other health care consumers.

Despite Russia's claims that it doesn't target civilians, its forces continue to attack urban areas, including a residential building outside Ukraine's capital where and several others were wounded Monday. This comes a day after Russian missiles hit a Ukrainian military base less than 15 miles from the border with Poland, which is a member of NATO, killing at least 35 people.  McMaster, a retired lieutenant general who served in the Trump administration, said he expects Russia will do everything it can to try to intercept any humanitarian assistance or shipping of supplies and military equipment to Ukraine.  \"What you're seeing is that Russia is really getting desperate \u2014 not only with this action to try to interdict the supply routes, but also with trying to lay the groundwork for, maybe, the use of chemical weapons, which is concerning,\" McMaster said Monday on \"CBS Mornings.\"  Last week, Russia called a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss what it called \"the of the U.S. on the territory of Ukraine.\" The White House denied the claim and denounced it as a \"false flag effort.\"  \"This is a real sign of weakness,\" McMaster said. \"I think Russia \u2014 and Putin, in particular \u2014 is in real trouble.\"  Despite the escalating rhetoric on biological and nuclear weapons, McMaster said talking about a possible World War III is not helpful.  \"It kind of plays into Putin's hand,\" he said. \"What he's trying to do is to threaten an escalation of the war so that we will throttle back on our support for Ukraine.\"  Story continues  McMaster also for not condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said the West should use that to its advantage.  \"What China's been doing is providing cover for Russia's mass murder of innocent civilians, spouting the same narrative that this isn't really a war, calling it a 'special military operation,' [and] also supporting these false claims of military bio-labs in Ukraine,\" McMaster said.  \"And I think it's a tremendous moment for the free world to shift the balance back in favor of the free world and away from these two authoritarian dictatorships,\" he said.  Russian and Ukrainian officials were set to meet Monday for a fourth round of talks, according to a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",

    "body": "He would set aside hundreds of thousands in high-dollar donations and would not touch it, not until he had raised at least $1,000 in small-dollar contributions from 100 different precincts in his district. Cold-calling donors on Election Day in 2014, he told one skeptical constituent: \u201cIn a sense, I'm calling from the future. I'm calling from a time when candidates will have an incentive to reach out to the small donors of the world.\u201d On Wednesday, the House will consider whether to make that world a reality. The public campaign-financing system Sarbanes envisions will go up for a vote as part of a sweeping campaign-finance and voting-access package he's worked on for the better part of 15 years. In the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol breach and an unprecedented assault on the integrity of the 2020 election, Democratic congressional leaders have made passing it their top priority. The voting wars come to Capitol Hill: Democrats eye national elections overhaul amid GOP crackdown House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Sarbanes the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the legislation in a speech on the House floor Tuesday, crediting his \u201clong-term dedication\u201d to advancing democracy. The bill \u2014 H.R. 1, the For the People Act \u2014 seeks to drastically broaden access to the ballot at a time when GOP state lawmakers are trying to advance more voting restrictions. It would expand early, absentee and mail-in voting, while also enabling automatic voter registration and trying to end partisan gerrymandering. And it seeks to amplify the power of grass-roots donors to counter the influence of big money in politics, through a small-dollar donor matching system. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d said Sarbanes, a Baltimore native who chairs the Democrats' Democracy Reform Task Force and is the son of the late Sen. Paul Sarbanes. A similar version of the bill was approved by the Democratic-majority House in 2019, but died in the Republican-controlled Senate. With Democrats now holding 50 Senate seats and the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Harris, some liberal lawmakers are pushing to get H.R. 1 through that chamber without a single Republican vote \u2014 a scenario that would require ditching the filibuster. \u201cWe've never needed it more than we needed it in this moment, when you look at what's happening across the country,\u201d Sarbanes said, citing Republican attempts to restrict voting access as well as President Donald Trump's effort to sow distrust in the U.S. electoral system leading up to the Capitol attack. \u201cWe've got a piece of legislation that can stop that voter suppression effort in its tracks, broadly expand people's access to the ballot box . . . and push back against this undue influence that big money has on our politics and the way we govern in America,\u201d Sarbanes said. State GOP lawmakers propose flurry of voting restrictions Under the campaign-finance overhaul included in H.R. 1, candidates would be able to opt into a six-to-one matching system for small-dollar donations. Just like in Sarbanes's experiment, they would only qualify to unlock the funds if they raise $50,000 from at least 1,000 small-dollar donors first, and agree not to take certain PAC money. The matching funds would be sourced not from taxpayers \u2014 as Republican critics have frequently and incorrectly asserted \u2014 but from civil settlements or criminal fees the federal government wins against corporate wrongdoers or major tax evaders. In the future Sarbanes envisions, a $50 donation from a donor of modest means would be worth $350 to the candidate. Sarbanes, a lawyer who worked for the state Education Department before running for Congress, said he became interested in campaign-finance issues soon after taking office, when he saw gun-control and climate-change legislation stymied by opposing lobbyists and fat checks from special-interest groups. Then came the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling in 2010 \u2014 \u201cunleashing super PACS on our politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it did was it kind of woke up the public to the role that big money was having,\u201d Sarbanes said. He began experimenting with his own campaign finance in the 2012 cycle. In his gerrymandered central Maryland district, he didn't have much to lose. \u201cThe idea was to pilot by my own design, in my own district, a set of incentives that would track with or mimic what a small-donor matching system might look like,\u201d he said. In first D.C. election with public financing, candidates and donors bumped up against rules A growing number of states and localities \u2014 including Maryland, the District and Montgomery County \u2014 have adopted public matching-fund systems in recent years, although theirs use taxpayer money. But no such system exists for congressional candidates. So Sarbanes improvised. He found himself hosting more in-district events to reach voters, including in poorer neighborhoods whose residents would not be targeted by most politicians. But Sarbanes didn't want $5,000 from them, only $5. \u201cThe impact it had on my own behavior taught me a lot about the virtues of a system like this,\u201d he said. His breakthrough moment, he said, came in the Glen Burnie shopping mall parking lot that day in 2014, when he convinced the skeptical woman to give him $5. There was something more rewarding about it, he recalled, than any check from a lobbyist could have been. \u201cI think maybe the future is now,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cWe've reached the point where if we can get a system like this in place, all the incentives can shift, and you'll see candidates that will finally reach out and build those bridges and connections to everyday Americans who maybe don't have a ton of money, but they can give something, and they want their voice to be heard.\u201d Today's Headlines The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.",

It is far from clear that Congress can pass even H.R. 4 to reauthorize preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, let alone pass some or all of H.R. 1. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right There is a tentative agreement between Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and ranking Republican Rep. John Katko (N.Y.) on legislation to form an independent Jan. 6 commission. Ideally, such a body would make a determination as to who precisely in the House or Senate may have assisted insurrectionists, what House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said to the disgraced former president during the violence, what role white supremacy played in the assault, and how the former president not only instigated the attack but also refused to come to the aid of the Capitol. Congress must pass that legislation, and it must complete its work, overcoming inevitable claims of executive privilege and attempts to evade subpoenas. The Justice Department will need to determine if there is a basis for prosecuting the former president on charges of tax fraud, voter fraud in Georgia and incitement to riot on Jan. 6. The Justice Department must also decide if other administration officials committed crimes and if any of the department's lawyers failed to uphold their oaths of office and professional responsibilities. New guardrails to insulate the Justice Department must be enacted. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Fierce fights over redistricting will play out in most states. Litigation will test the extent to which partisan redistricting poses a threat to equal protection and the right to vote. However, it is no exaggeration to say that even if pro-democracy forces prevailed on every one of these issues (and they won't), the republic would still be imperiled if the GOP wins the House majority in 2022. I do not simply refer to the GOP's express determination to obstruct President Biden, even when it comes to overwhelmingly popular legislation. I do not say this because of the fear that reckless House Republicans would shut down the government or default on the debt. These are entirely possible, if not probable, but the potential threat to democracy is far worse than these dangerous scenarios. Let's be clear: If Republicans gain the majority, McCarthy would almost certainly be elected speaker, and if not, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) or newly selected conference chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) \u2014 who immediately signaled her loyalty to the former president \u2014 would lead the chamber. We know they take direction not from voters or the Constitution but from Mar-a-Lago. The former insurrectionist in chief could tell them not to certify any Democratic president in 2024. And it's a good bet House Republicans would salute and comply. (They complied in 2020 but simply lacked the votes to steal the election.) If the MAGA cult leader instructed his minions to impeach Biden or Cabinet members, the likes of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) would no doubt comply. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement We have seen the havoc they wreaked on our intelligence community while they were in the minority. Now imagine Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. One can bet a GOP House majority would shut down an independent commission or other body investigating Jan. 6 if it had not completed its work. The same Republicans who shared the \u201csick\u201d view, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described it on Thursday, that the violent insurrectionists acted like orderly tourists would be in charge of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. In short, an unredeemed and emboldened GOP, if given majority control of the House, would behave just as irresponsibly as the former president because he would still be calling the shots . It is for this reason that no one should pine for \u201cgood\u201d Republicans to win House races in 2022 \u2014 unless a majority pledged to acknowledge the events of Jan. 6, repudiated the \u201cbig lie,\u201d and ruled out making McCarthy, Stefanik or another Trump stooge speaker. Since the chances of that are nil, the only way to prevent a parade of horribles would be to elect a Democratic House majority. Only one party has shown its willingness to facilitate the peaceful transfer of power, and hence only one party should be entrusted with the authority to run the House. A House Republican caucus that signed onto a brief disenfranchising voters in states Biden won, and refusing to recognize legitimate electoral votes, is not one that should ever obtain the chance to fix a presidential election.

    "body": "measures that would make it easier to vote and register, place sharp limits on voter suppression and other hurdles to participation, and end extreme gerrymanders. It is inconceivable that anything like this package \u2014 known as H.R. 1 \u2014 could ever pass the Senate as long as the legislative filibuster remains. Which is why it was welcome when Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) came out in support of ending the filibuster if it is necessary to pass measures defending voting rights. Unfortunately, the way Klobuchar described the issue also inescapably highlights how few other Democrats are discussing it in these terms. Klobuchar made the comments in an interview with Ari Berman \u201cI would get rid of the filibuster,\u201d Klobuchar says. \u201cI have favored filibuster reform for a long time and now especially for this critical election bill.\u201d In the past, Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate Rules Committee, has indicated she was open to eliminating the filibuster, but these comments to Mother Jones are her most definitive statement to date. Though her Democratic colleagues Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have said they would not support abolishing the filibuster, Klobuchar notes that the spread of new GOP anti-voting bills boosts the need for Democrats to enact HR 1 \u2014 and that increases the pressure to end or alter the Senate filibuster. \u201cWe have a raw exercise of political power going on where people are making it harder to vote and you just can't let that happen in a democracy because of some old rules in the Senate,\u201d she says. What's critical here is that Klobuchar, who is decidedly not a member of the party's liberal wing, bluntly described the central question as one over whether Democrats will allow themselves to be steamrolled by a Republican exercise of power Across the country, GOP state legislatures are using the power they have to tilt the future electoral playing field to their anti-majoritarian advantage, making it harder to vote wherever possible and even boasting that extreme gerrymanders will help them recapture the House. Will Democrats really allow the filibuster \u2014 itself an anti-majoritarian relic of Jim Crow \u2014 to constrain them from using their power to defend the voting rights and majoritarian features of our democracy even as Republicans undermine them as dramatically as they possibly can? This is Klobuchar's framing. How often do you hear other Democrats discuss the issue in quite these terms? Indeed, our discourse is so upside down that it gets discussed in precisely the opposite way. Democrats such as Manchin and Sinema constantly treat keeping the filibuster as something that will facilitate the operations of democracy. For instance, NBC News reports that Sinema sent a letter to constituents insisting that keeping it will smooth a \u201cbipartisan process\u201d that will respect \u201cthe opinions of senators from the minority party\u201d and \u201cresult in better, commonsense legislation.\u201d That's nonsense. In an ideal world where civic virtue and good faith reigned, denying a partisan majority the ability to pass legislation theoretically results in more bipartisanship, since that majority then needs a few members of the minority to get 60 votes to end filibusters. But that's not the world that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made. He has a long history of using the filibuster as a tool to facilitate the withholding of any and all bipartisan cooperation and to cast the Democratic president as a failed conciliator, irrespective of whether that president actually does offer concessions to GOP senators. Whatever Republican senators' \u201copinions,\u201d the incentives tilt against them engaging in a \u201cbipartisan process,\u201d since refraining is better for their party overall. Ironically, without the filibuster, GOP senators might be more inclined to negotiate to place their stamp on legislation they know might pass without them. Playing this ugly game is McConnell's right under Senate rules, but no one is obliged to pretend not to understand how the filibuster actually functions: In reality, it gums up the functioning of government and incentivizes raw partisan power politics. In the case of voting rights, this will be even more stark. Republicans are doing everything they can to rig democracy to their anti-majoritarian advantage wherever possible, for purely partisan purposes. Will Sinema and Manchin really prevent the Senate majority from protecting voters from these schemes in the name of bipartisanship As Ronald Brownstein writes , the GOP escalation of these tactics \u2014 revealing a party entirely unchastened about its full-scale effort to overturn a national election \u2014 suggests we may be at a \u201cturning point in the history of U.S. democracy\u201d: Against the backdrop of the red-state voting offensive, the fate of H.R. 1 looks like a genuine inflection point. If Democrats can't persuade Manchin, Sinema, and any other filibuster proponents to kill the parliamentary tool, Senate Republicans will be able to shield their state-level allies from federal interference. Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the sponsor of H.R. 1, told Brownstein: \u201cIf we can't get these changes in place in time for the 2022 midterm election,\u201d it may be too late, and Republicans may \u201clock in this voter-suppression regime.\u201d Klobuchar now seems to get this.

    "body": "\u00b7  3 min read  WASHINGTON Feb. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The founders of Veteran-owned and operated American Weed Co . (\"AmWeCo\"), a\nnew cannabis company that is devoting a share of its revenues to fighting the epidemic of US veteran suicide and modernizing outdated federal cannabis policies, today announced they will travel to Washington, DC next week for meetings with lawmakers as a new Republican majority in the US House ramps up. Their mission: legalize weed for every veteran nationwide. And they have the backing of a former Republican Speaker of the House.\n  \"Veterans are the reason we are all free,\" said AmWeCo co-founders and co-CEOs Ryan Brooks and Sean Gilfillan . \"We're stepping up for change, and we're calling on Republicans and Democrats alike in Washington to do the same. Legalize weed for Veterans now.\"\n  Brooks and Gilfillan will be in Washington, DC the week of March 6 urging legislators to support the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act (H.R. 394), bipartisan legislation authored by US Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL) that would ensure Veterans receive the appropriate treatment to address their health care needs by prohibiting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from denying a Veteran benefits due to the use of medical marijuana in states where the substance is legal.\n  \"What Sean and Ryan are doing is admirable, and my guess is it's also going to be pretty effective,\" said former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH). \"Hearing directly from veterans and veterans' advocates about the healing potential of cannabis is what made me start to re-examine my position when I was in office, and these guys have a very powerful message.\"\n  AmWeCo will also be donating up to 10 percent of its net profits each year to Stop Soldier Suicide , where Sean is on the advisory board. AmWeCo revenues also fund the company's involvement in the National Cannabis Roundtable , an alliance of cannabis companies and other stakeholders working to modernize federal cannabis policy on behalf of veterans and other Americans from all walks of life.",

    "body": "The measure, H.R. 3617 , is known as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, or the MORE Act. The House passed similar legislation in December 2020, but it was not brought up for a vote in the Senate, which was controlled by Republicans at the time.  Friday's 220-to-204 vote largely took place along partisan lines, with only three Republicans joining most Democrats to back the legislation. Two Democrats voted \u201cno.\u201d  It remains unclear whether the latest measure will receive a vote in the Senate. The White House has not yet issued a statement on whether President Biden supports the legislation. A group of Senate Democrats including Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.) is expected to release draft marijuana legislation later this month.  In addition to eliminating criminal penalties for the manufacture, distribution or possession of marijuana, the MORE Act would provide for the regulation and taxation of legal cannabis sales. It also would provide for the expungement of federal marijuana convictions dating to 1971 and bars the denial of federal public benefits or security clearances on the basis of marijuana offenses.  The past decade has seen a significant shift in public attitudes toward marijuana, with all but a handful of states having changed their laws. Some have legalized only medical marijuana use, while others allow both recreational and medical use. The drug has also become a jobs creator, with legal cannabis sales totaling $19 billion in 2020 and expected to reach $41 billion by 2025.  Decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level would not end the vast majority of cannabis-use prosecutions, which occur in state courts. But it would end troublesome conflicts between state and federal law for those states that have loosened pot restrictions and would greatly ease commerce for the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry.  Public opinion appears to be in line with the state-level electoral trend. In late 2020, a Gallup survey found that 68 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be legal, the highest support for marijuana legalization since the polling organization first asked in 1969.",

Subscribe today. arrow-right The 14th Amendment is a dog's dinner of clauses that lay out the rights of U.S. citizens. The first clause establishes a uniform standard for naturalized citizens and guarantees that right regardless of who you are. It prohibits states from enacting laws that restrict a citizen's constitutionally granted rights. It finishes by guaranteeing equal protection under the law. This clause provides the foundation to require the Supreme Court to declare the vast majority of voter suppression laws illegal. The second clause punishes states that deny the right to vote to citizens and allows them to deny the right to felons and those who have participated in rebellion against the United States. This could be used to punish states that restrict voting rights. The fifth instructs Congress to enact such legislation needed to see to it that the first four clauses are enforced.

    "body": "Dr. Jeffrey Pevnick was on the brink of retirement last year when he was diagnosed with a potentially fatal heart condition and thrown a financial curveball: The St. Louis psychiatrist was prescribed a $225,000-a-year drug \u2014 Pfizer PFE, \u2019s tafamidis \u2014 to treat the disease.\n\nUnder his Medicare prescription-drug plan, his initial out-of-pocket cost was about $5,000 for a three-month supply of the capsules, he says. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take it, I\u2019ll die sooner,\u201d he says of the drug, which is the only Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved treatment for his condition. But the price is \u201coutrageous,\u201d says Pevnick, 72, who retired in January. \u201cI think it\u2019s greed.\u201d\n\nPeople on all sides of the contentious drug-pricing debate agree on one thing: Retirees like Pevnick shouldn\u2019t have to drain their bank accounts at the pharmacy counter. A cap on out-of-pocket costs in Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription-drug benefit is an element of Republican and Democratic drug-pricing bills as well as the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s reform agenda.\n\nBut drug-pricing researchers say the popular Part D overhaul, which would help millions of retirees and perhaps even save lives, must be paired with broader reforms that directly tackle high drug prices \u2014 and those are far more controversial.\n\nBiogen BIIB, \u2019s announcement Monday of a $56,000-a-year list price for its newly approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatment, Aduhelm, will likely only intensify the debate, policy experts say.\n\nReforms focused only on limiting out-of-pocket costs would dampen the consumer price sensitivity that helps keep drug prices in check, many researchers say, contributing to higher drug prices, premiums and government spending. In the absence of other changes, a Part D out-of-pocket cap would be \u201clike writing a blank check to the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d says Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nRiding a tide of goodwill generated by the COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 success, drug manufacturers are backing the out-of-pocket cap and advancing other ideas in Congress as well as in court that largely cushion patients\u2019 exposure to the cost of medications without addressing underlying drug prices directly, researchers say.\n\nNext week, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a case Pfizer filed last year against the federal government, seeking a legal go-ahead for proposed copay assistance programs that would let the pharmaceutical giant help cover many Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 costs for tafamidis \u2014 sold by Pfizer as Vyndamax and Vyndaqel \u2014 the drug Pevnick takes for his heart condition. Ge Bai, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and Bloomberg School of Public Health, says the lawsuit is part of a broader pattern of drug companies attempting \u201cto blindfold or insulate patients from the true cost of the medications they use,\u201d giving the companies more leeway to maintain high prices.\n\nPfizer said in a statement that it appreciates that cost sharing is intended to make patients more price-conscious and incentivize the use of lower-cost therapies. \u201cHowever, we do not believe the Medicare Part D benefit design was intended to limit access to breakthrough therapies for middle-income Medicare patients when no other approved therapeutic options are available,\u201d the company said. The company declined to comment for this story about tafamidis\u2019s price, but Suneet Varma, global president of Pfizer\u2019s rare-disease unit, told Barron\u2019s last year that the price is \u201cresponsible, because of the transformational value this delivers for patients and the size of the rare-disease population it treats.\u201d\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, the powerful drug-industry trade group, backs a Part D out-of-pocket cap, among other reforms, but has not endorsed any particular drug-pricing legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to come to the table and be a part of those discussions,\u201d says PhRMA spokesman Brian Newell. \u201cWe recognize these reforms have costs associated with them, and we\u2019re willing to do our fair share so long as it lowers what patients pay at the pharmacy and protects patient access to medicines and future innovation.\u201d\n\nFor retirees as well as many younger patients and taxpayers, drug pricing is a high-stakes debate. Over the next 10 years, more than 1.1 million Medicare patients could die because they can\u2019t afford their prescriptions, according to a recent study by West Health Policy Center. In 2021, Medicare Part D enrollees must spend $6,550 out of pocket before they reach the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d coverage phase, where they typically still have to pay 5% of a drug\u2019s cost, without limit. For retirees taking pricier drugs, that 5% is often unaffordable. Medicare picks up 80% of the drug cost in the catastrophic phase, while Part D plans pay the remaining 15%, and the drug companies pay nothing. High prices for brand-name specialty drugs mean that a growing number of patients hit catastrophic coverage after filling a single prescription, and Medicare\u2019s spending in the catastrophic phase, which more than quadrupled between 2010 and 2019, is expected to reach $88 billion by 2029, according to a report by Medicare\u2019s trustees.\n\nA bill in the House aims to lower out-of-pocket costs while also addressing drug prices directly, in part through a government price-negotiation provision that the pharmaceutical industry opposes. \u201cThe only way you get pharmaceutical prices under control is to allow the price negotiation,\u201d says Rep. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat. The fact that the federal government, the largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the U.S., can\u2019t negotiate prices is \u201cobviously absurd,\u201d Welch says.\n\nAlthough doubts were raised in recent weeks about Democratic consensus on the bill, known as H.R. 3, some on Capitol Hill say the divisions aren\u2019t deal breakers. A letter last month from 10 House Democrats to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said legislation \u201cshould make patient affordability the number one goal\u201d and emphasized the need for bipartisanship, spawning questions about the fate of the bill and its price-negotiation provision. But Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat and a lead signer of the letter, \u201chas always supported Medicare negotiation of drug prices,\u201d says spokesman Matt Corridoni. \u201cHe is ultimately committed to voting with the Democratic caucus position, including H.R. 3.\u201d\n\nPam Holt, a cancer patient and veteran of the drug-pricing debate, is getting frustrated with the lack of legislative progress. The 72-year-old retired teacher in Granger, Ind., has taken Revlimid for multiple myeloma since 2016. Under her Medicare Part D plan, her out-of-pocket cost was close to $12,000 the first year, she says, \u201cwhich was devastating,\u201d and the drug\u2019s price has only climbed since then. Though she now needs fewer pills per month, she spent $6,700 on the drug in the first four months of this year, she says.\n\nAfter launching Revlimid in 2005, drug maker Celgene raised the drug\u2019s price 22 times, according to a 2020 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Bristol Myers Squibb BMY, acquired Celgene in late 2019 and raised Revlimid\u2019s price again, to $763 per pill, the report found. The more than $4 billion that Medicare Part D plans and beneficiaries spent on Revlimid in 2018 was the second highest expenditure for any Part D drug that year, according to the House committee.\n\nTo cover Revlimid\u2019s cost, Holt says, she has taken on credit-card debt, refinanced her house, and sacrificed many of the pleasures of retirement, like travel and spending on her grandchildren. Holt is \u201cfurious\u201d about the price increases, she says, particularly given that Revlimid is not a new drug and she sees the price hikes as \u201cpure profit\u201d for the company.\n\nThough she started talking to lawmakers about drug-pricing issues several years ago and \u201cheard lots of promises,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to stay positive about it in light of nothing ever really happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take great care to price our medicines based on the value they deliver, the scientific innovation they represent, economic factors that impact healthcare systems\u2019 capacity to provide appropriate, rapid and sustainable access to patients, and the investment necessary to develop them,\u201d a Bristol Myers Squibb spokesperson says.\n\nA Pfizer victory in its lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would further boost Medicare spending on pricey medication, researchers say. The suit revolves around federal policies that prohibit drug manufacturers from giving direct copay assistance to Medicare patients and restricts their funding of independent patient-assistance charities. A drug company that offers anything of value to induce Medicare patients to take the company\u2019s drug may violate federal anti-kickback laws. If Pfizer wins, its proposed copay-assistance programs could be \u201ca convenient tool\u201d to tamp down patients\u2019 price sensitivity, Bai says.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s view that copay assistance is not permitted means many seniors will have to forgo their needed prescriptions,\u201d according to a Pfizer statement. The company supports Part D changes, including an out-of-pocket cap, but, until that happens, providing copay assistance to patients prescribed tafamidis \u201crepresents an equitable way to lower out-of-pocket costs for eligible patients,\u201d the company says.\n\nNo matter what they\u2019re paying out of pocket, many Medicare patients taking pricier drugs are concerned about how those costs will impact other payers and their drug-plan premiums. Darrell Dodds spent more than $20,000 out of pocket on tafamidis between late 2019 and May of this year, he says, before qualifying for free medication through a patient-assistance program based on his income. The drug\u2019s price is \u201coff-the-charts crazy,\u201d says Dodds, 77, a retiree in Krum, Texas, and he contacted his congressman to push for action on drug prices but got no response. For rare-disease drugs like tafamidis, he says, drug companies can \u201ccharge whatever the hell they want, and the government so far has shown absolutely no spine in dealing with it.\u201d\n\nSome countries aren\u2019t shy about tackling the issue. In guidance last month, the U.K.\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, rejected tafamidis for treatment of the heart condition, transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, saying the cost-effectiveness estimates didn\u2019t meet its threshold for an acceptable use of National Health Service resources. Pfizer said in a statement that NICE\u2019s evaluation methods need to evolve to address barriers that \u201chinder equal access to rare disease medicines\u201d in the U.K.\n\nIn Washington, the time to strike a drug-pricing deal is growing short, some analysts say. If there\u2019s no agreement and the issue gets pushed into next year \u2014 a midterm-election year \u2014 the odds of success plummet, says Rick Weissenstein, managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Republicans will be willing to give the Democrats that win, and I think everybody retreats back into their foxholes.\u201d\n\nTo be effective, reforms should not only lower patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs but also deal with incentives in the payment system that are pushing prices higher and address underlying drug prices directly, such as through government price negotiation, says Rachel Sachs, associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cThere is no one drug-pricing problem,\u201d Sachs says. With so many factors keeping drug prices high, \u201cno one policy will solve all of them.\u201d\n\nH.R. 3\u2019s multipronged approach would cap Part D out-of-pocket costs at an initial $2,000 per year, require drug companies in some cases to pay rebates to the government if they raise drug prices faster than inflation, and allow the government to negotiate certain drug prices with manufacturers, using international market prices as a target in negotiations and making those negotiated prices available to commercial plans. The negotiation provision would cut government spending by about $456 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It could also slash commercial health-insurance costs, according to a recent analysis by West Health Policy Center, saving employers $195 billion and workers $98 billion. \u201cNot a lot of people realize just how important H.R. 3 would be for reducing healthcare costs for everyone in America,\u201d not just seniors, says Sean Dickson, the center\u2019s director of health policy.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry objects to the negotiation approach laid out in the bill, which would impose financial penalties on manufacturers if they don\u2019t agree to a price that falls within certain parameters. That\u2019s \u201creally not a negotiation,\u201d PhRMA\u2019s Newell says. The industry spent a record $92 million lobbying the federal government in the first quarter of this year, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, up 6.3% from the same period last year.\n\nA more likely outcome, Weissenstein says, may be something similar to reforms previously put together by the Senate Finance Committee. That package included a Part D out-of-pocket cap and inflation-based rebates to rein in price increases, among other measures. Such reforms would cost drug manufacturers about $100 billion to $120 billion over 10 years, Weissenstein estimates, but would likely be viewed positively by investors in pharmaceutical stocks, who would be happy to get the issue off the table for now, he says.\n\nMany patients relying on Medicare to cover their drugs face more painful trade-offs. Grant Ellis, 32, of Cambridge, Mass., has Medicare coverage due to a disability and relies largely on Social Security disability income of $780 a month. Early this year, he faced an unexpected $720 in out-of-pocket drug costs, he says, when his Part D plan added a prior-authorization requirement for one of his medications. \u201cI was completely insolvent at the end of the month,\u201d he says, and he had to turn to GoFundMe just to raise enough money for food. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d he says, because he\u2019d carefully researched his Part D plan options and tried to diligently manage his expenses. \u201cI thought I did everything right.\u201d",

    "body": "This year, Congress may finally vote on reparations \u2014 a bill to study how African Americans might be compensated for centuries of enslavement and its vestiges, which wreaked untold economic damage that continues to this day. Thirty-two years after H.R. 40 was introduced, a bill passed out of the House Judiciary Committee in April for consideration by the full House. But given the Senate filibuster and Republican hostility , an executive order is a more promising path to a reparations victory for Americans of African descent. Waiting for Congress or the White House is not necessary. As we are showing here in Evanston, Ill., actual reparations, not just their study, can be enacted by cities nationwide. All it takes is determination, humility and an unwavering commitment to reparatory justice. In 2017, when I ran for alderman in Evanston's historically segregated 5th Ward, I little imagined that by the end of my term this spring, the City Council would have enacted the country's first government-funded local reparations program for African Americans. But I knew the idea had been introduced in Evanston nearly two decades ago , and I was happy to take up the cause. Last March, after three City Council votes and numerous community meetings where local residents could weigh in, the reparations law passed. Given the 2020 legalization of recreational marijuana use in Illinois, our law allowed Evanston's City Council to restrict cannabis tax revenue to fund the $10 million reparations initiative. The first of that amount has been approved for a restorative housing program to fund home repairs, mortgage payments or other property costs. Initial benefits are on track to be disbursed by the end of the year. Payments of $25,000 were earmarked for 16 Black residents (or their direct descendants) who lived in Evanston between 1919 and 1969 \u2014 the period during which the local government caused them harm. Yes, that amount is inadequate in the context of the massive intergenerational economic devastation inflicted by slavery, but it is real money and should be considered a down payment on what is rightfully owed to millions of African Americans. The recipients are already being called the \u201cEvanston 16,\u201d a reference to the \u201c Little Rock Nine ,\u201d students who sparked the desegregation of the nation's schools. Though just about any city in the United States could make a similar claim, given slavery's malignant role in American history, Evanston would be a fitting touchstone for the reparations movement. Its persistent racial wealth gap mirrors that of a nation where White families have eight times the net worth of Black families, according to the Federal Reserve. Evanston's Black residents, according to city documents, earn an average of $46,000 less in household income than White residents and have 13 years fewer in life expectancy Discriminatory housing policies play a central role in the economic disenfranchisement of African Americans. In Evanston, segregation was achieved by \u201credlining\u201d mortgage practices, and the city government often condoned Whites-only housing covenants. As an alderman, I also came to better understand how seemingly innocuous zoning ordinances have long ravaged Black neighborhoods, locking entire blocks in concentrated poverty. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Evanston you can find palatial lakefront estates with private beaches and whimsical gazebos. Those areas might be separated by just a few blocks, but given the disparities in education, health and income stretching back more than a century and a half in Evanston, they might as well be in different universes. Real estate is the No. 1 intergenerational wealth-building asset in America \u2014 even more so among the lowest-income households, where homeownership represents on average nearly 75 percent of total assets. Given that property in Black neighborhoods nationwide is undervalued by $48,000 per home on average, amounting to $156 billion in cumulative losses, it makes sense for reparations plans to begin with housing. My term as 5th Ward alderman ended last spring, and I am now working, through a nonprofit I founded, to spread local reparations initiatives across the country. And I have joined with organizations, such as the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, or N'COBRA , to support passage of national legislation. H.R. 40 faces long odds, but beyond the achievement of simply getting the bill out of committee, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.), its sponsor, can also point to remarkable progress in gaining support for the legislation. In May 2019, the federal bill had just 55 co-sponsors , but over the past two years, the congresswoman has gathered 193 co-sponsors to the cause. The moral argument for reparations is gradually making inroads. But local governments don't need to wait for a Washington tipping point. Last year, the City Council of Asheville, N.C., voted unanimously to apologize for the city's role in slavery and to launch a reparations program that, rather than making direct payments to individuals, mandates investment in areas where Black residents face disparities. That's another step toward justice. Repeated hundreds of times, in hundreds of cities, reparations would stretch from coast to coast.

    "body": "After decades of work from activists pushing the issue, presidential candidates, Congress members, local governments and private institutions have debated whether and how the federal government should issue reparations for Black Americans who are descendants of slaves.\n\nAs the Biden administration promises to confront structural racism and inequality, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers have given their support to H.R. 40, a decades-old bill first introduced by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1989. The bill would create a commission to study slavery and discrimination in the United States\u00a0 and potential reparations proposals for restitution.\n\nIn April, H.R. 40 moved out of committee for the first time, potentially setting up a floor vote on the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing reckoning with racial injustice and the health disparities exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic have called further attention to the ways Black people have faced generations of systemic discrimination.\n\nBut with an issue so large and complex, proponents suggest a range of ways the U.S. could engage in reparations while opponents say the time for redress for slavery and the discrimination that followed has passed.\n\nCalls for reparations for enslaved men and women \u2014 and later, their descendants \u2014 have been made in various forms since the end of the Civil War. But these demands have never been met by the federal government.\n\nIn 1865, Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman ordered that land confiscated from Confederate landowners be divided up into 40-acre portions and distributed to newly emancipated Black families. Following President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, however, the order granting \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was swiftly rescinded by new President Andrew Johnson. The majority of the land was returned to white landowners.\n\nAfter the Civil War, formerly enslaved men and women also argued that their unpaid labor while in bondage entitled them to pensions. Their demands received resistance\u00a0from the federal government, which accused prominent pension supporters of fraud and ignored pension bills brought up in Congress.\n\nBut as the federal government denied land and resources to formerly enslaved people, it created new pathways for land ownership for white Americans. For instance, the federal government passed the Homestead Act in 1862, granting 160-acre plots to applicants.\n\n\u201cBlack families received no assets from the federal government while large numbers of white families received substantial assets as a starting point for building wealth in the United States\u201d under the act, said William Darity, a professor of public policy at Duke University and author of \u201cFrom Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d\n\nDarity added that calls for reparations are a \u201cspecific claim that is connected to the failure to provide the ancestors of today's living descendants who were deprived of the 40-acre land grants that they were promised.\u201d\n\nAfter the war and during the Reconstruction era, Black Southerners made political, social and economic progress, but these gains were quickly overturned. Discrimination was further entrenched through laws regulating every facet of Black life, including housing restrictions, legal segregation and racially motivated terrorism and lynchings.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Black Americans also continued to be denied opportunities to build wealth under federal programs that benefited white families and communities.\n\nUnder the GI Bill, for example, \u201cmortgage and school tuition benefits extended to black soldiers were devalued due to state endorsed and enforced segregation,\u201d law professor Adrienne Davis argued in a pro-reparations human rights brief published in 2000.\n\n\"There were far fewer places they could attend school or purchase housing,\" Davis wrote. \"The schools they were able to attend and houses they were able to buy were less valuable because they were black institutions and neighborhoods, respectively, in an economy that valued whiteness.\"\n\nExcluding domestic and farm workers from Social Security legislation effectively shut out 60 percent of Black people \u201cacross the U.S. and 75 percent in southern states who worked in these occupations,\u201d according to policy think tank the Brookings Institution.\n\nExperts argue that such omissions from federal policy have not been fully corrected and have been magnified by widening health, education, employment and housing disparities, as well as a lack of access to capital.\n\nCollectively, these historical and current disadvantages have led reparations proponents to argue that while slavery is where denials of wealth and equal rights began, the cumulative effects of both slavery and systematic federal denials of opportunity that followed continue to impact the descendants of enslaved people in the present.\n\nIn recent years, reparations have often been discussed alongside the racial wealth gap, or the difference between wealth held by white Americans compared to that of other races.\n\nResearch has found that the gap between white and Black Americans has not narrowed in recent decades. White households hold roughly 10 times more wealth than Black ones, similar to the gap in 1968. While Black Americans account for roughly 13 percent of the American population, they hold about 4 percent of America\u2019s wealth. Experts note the gap is not due to a lack of education or effort but rather is due to a lack of capital and resources that have left Black individuals more vulnerable to economic shocks and made it difficult for Black families to build inheritable wealth over generations.\n\nDarity and co-author Kirsten Mullen say closing this wealth gap should be a fundamental goal of a reparations program and should guide how such a program is structured. In their book, Darity and Mullen call for a system of reparations that primarily consists of direct financial payments made by the federal government to eligible Black Americans who had at least one ancestor enslaved in the United States.\n\nProposals for reparations programs have also been raised by reparations advocacy groups in recent decades. The National African American Reparations Commission, for example, has a 10-point reparations plan that includes calls for a national apology for slavery and subsequent discrimination; a repatriation program that would allow interested people to receive assistance when exercising their \u201cright to return\u201d to an African nation of their choice; affordable housing and education programs; and the preservation of Black monuments and sacred sites, with the proposals benefiting any person of African descent living in the US.\n\nOther proposals, like one proposed by Andre Perry and Rashawn Ray for the Brookings Institution, would also specifically provide restitution to descendants with at least one ancestor enslaved in the U.S., coupling direct financial payment with plans for free college tuition, student loan forgiveness, grants for down payments and housing revitalization and grants for Black-owned businesses.\n\n\u201cMaking the American Dream an equitable reality demands the same U.S. government that denied wealth to Blacks restore that deferred wealth through reparations to their descendants,\u201d they wrote last year.\n\nThe variety of proposals show that even among supporters of reparations, there is some disagreement about what a full program should look like and what exactly should be described as \u201ctrue reparations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we would be doing ourselves a huge disservice if we were just talking about financial compensation alone,\u201d said Dreisen Heath, a racial justice researcher with Human Rights Watch.\n\nWhile Heath said she did support and see the value in direct financial payments, she added that money alone \u201cis not going to fix if you were wrongly convicted in a racist legal system. That\u2019s not going to fix your access to preventative health care. All of these other harms are connected to the racial wealth gap but are not exclusively defined by or can be relieved by financial compensation.\u201d\n\nSome local governments \u2014 most notably Evanston, Illinois, and Asheville, North Carolina \u2014 are also attempting to issue reparations for historical discrimination Black residents of these areas faced. These attempts have been praised by some proponents, who say the wide-ranging harms of slavery and subsequent discrimination requires a multipronged solution.\n\n\u201cReparations efforts at multiple levels are necessary because the harms were on multiple levels \u2014 the institutional, at the state level and at the federal level,\u201d Heath said. \u201cSpecific harms were committed and need to be remedied in a very specific way. There\u2019s no blanket reparations program for a specific community.\u201d\n\nStill, critics of such programs, like Darity and Mullen, say municipal efforts are not significant enough in scale because of sheer municipal budget restrictions. They also say localized programs simply miss the point.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing racial equity initiatives that are being touted as reparations programs,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cFor us, a reparations program must center on eliminating the racial wealth gap, and putting people on committees and panels is not going to do that.\u201d\n\nDiscussion of how to best conceptualize reparations has spilled over into debates over H.R. 40, which languished in a House subcommittee for more than three decades before being voted out of committee this year. While supporters of the legislation argue it is the best vehicle for better understanding the need for and possible avenues of providing reparations, Darity and Mullen say in its current form, the measure could ultimately do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems with H.R. 40 is that it is not at all clear that it provides us with a direction towards eliminating the racial wealth gap,\u201d Darity said. He added that the bill\u2019s impacts are limited because it creates a commission rather than directly approving a reparations program.\n\nSupporters of the bill, including members of pro-reparations advocacy groups like the National African American Reparations Commission and the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America counter that the bill would do more than simply study the evidence supporting reparations and is a crucial step toward providing reparative justice.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the bill's main sponsor, and other congressional Democratic leaders have said they hope to move forward with a House floor vote on the bill this summer.\n\nStill, reaction to the legislation not only reveals fundamental differences between reparations proponents but also shows there continues to be a vocal contingent of reparations critics who argue that a federal effort to provide redress for the harms of slavery and the decades of discrimination that followed is unnecessary. Critics say slavery happened too long ago and thus the harms are too old to be repaired. Others say the mere idea of reparations frames Black Americans as helpless.\n\n\u201cReparation is divisive. It speaks to the fact that we are a hapless, hopeless race that never did anything but wait for white people to show up and help us \u2014 and it\u2019s a falsehood,\u201d Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the House, said during debate on H.R. 40 in April. \u201cIt\u2019s demeaning to my parents\u2019 generation.\u201d\n\nExperts argue the focus shouldn\u2019t be on whether reparations are divisive but if they are necessary, saying Black American descendants of enslaved people have a valid claim for redress and restitution.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been this amount of stalling for reparations for Japanese Americans, or around the appropriation for restitution for 9/11 victims, or continued support for Holocaust survivors in the U.S.,\u201d Heath said. \u201cReparation is only seen as a bad word when we\u2019re talking about repair and restitution for Black people.\u201d\n\nUltimately, supporters argue the need for reparations should not be judged based on how popular the issue is publicly but instead should be looked at as a necessary correction for the moral, political and economic failures that have been created by federal policy at the expense of Black Americans.\n\nDarity argued that even if detailed reparations measures are not politically feasible in Congress now, it is important that \u201cthe footprints must be put in place\u201d for future efforts.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the generational relationship to enslavement, you find that it doesn\u2019t really feel all that long ago,\u201d Darity said of efforts to frame reparations as solely focused on the past. \u201cBut what\u2019s more important is that the effects of the period of enslavement are still felt and still embodied in the kinds of consequences for Black lives today.\u201d",

While some of them receive the support and training they need to transition to new lives once their racing careers have ended, others are not so fortunate. To my mind, the most shocking case was that of Ferdinand, a champion Thoroughbred who won the 1986 Kentucky Derby and 1987 Breeders' Cup Classic, was named the 1987 Horse of the Year, and retired as the sport's fifth leading earner of all time. He became a stud in 1989and was sold to a breeding farm in Japan in 1994. After his career as a stallion, he was slaughtered \u2013 much to the shock of the racing world.  Unbeknownst to many, every year, tens of thousands of American horses are trucked to Canada and Mexico to be brutally slaughtered, their meat consumed by foreign diners. The slaughtering process itself is grossly inhumane, due to the animals' anatomy and their instinctive flight response that triggers them to try to escape from danger.  On top of that, the horses endure long, punishing transport to the slaughterhouse without adequate rest, veterinary care, food or water, and some die during that awful journey.  These horses were not intended to become someone's food and the vast majority have been administered a variety of both legal and illegal drugs that are prohibited for use in animals destined for human consumption.  Ferdinand and horses like him were on my mind when I joined like-minded individuals in the horse racing industry to help pass the We who love racehorses and the sport are obliged to support the new doping, medication control and racetrack safety standards mandated by the legislation because it will make racing safer for both horses and jockeys.  Story continues  Hall of Fame jockey Chris McCarron was the grand marshal of Lexington's St. Patrick's Day parade. Photo by Pablo Alcala | Staff  Ending horse slaughter would be a proper next step in restoring our compact with racehorses. Although Congress has annually passed legislation prohibiting the domestic slaughter of horses, there is no law to prohibit the export of American horses abroad to be slaughtered for human consumption, so a predatory horse slaughter industry continues to operate across our borders in Canada and Mexico. The H.R.3355/S.2732 would bring an end to all of that, and it speaks to the resolve of American horse racing's leadership that The Jockey Club, The Breeders' Cup, the New York Racing Association, The Stronach Group, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, all stand in strong support.  What is needed to get this crucial bill over the finish line is increased public awareness and support. I urge racing fans and all animal lovers to contact their U.S. representative and senators with the message that they abhor horse slaughter, and they vote \u2013 and urge those legislators to pass the SAFE Act in this Congress. It is a matter of life and death for our beloved equine companions.  Chris McCarron is a retired Hall of Fame jockey who twice won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.

If passed and signed into law, the bipartisan bill would commission a working group to evaluate how the U.S. currently treats digital assets. Why it matters This might be the first major crypto bill to get anywhere in Congress. What's more, it's one that, if passed, would have a direct impact on how the U.S. treats digital assets. This could finally provide companies in this industry with some much-requested regulatory clarity. The fact the bill has support from both parties is another mark in its favor. Of course, if regulatory agencies don't act until this bill is implemented, it'll be quite some time before any actual clarity is adopted. Breaking it down The entire House of Representatives passed the \u201cEliminate Barriers to Innovation Act,\u201d introduced by Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) in March , making it the first major crypto-specific legislation to get through one of the bodies of Congress. A number of other bills have also been introduced to define how cryptocurrencies can or should be treated under U.S. law, but few have made any progress. \u201cIt's the first bill to address regulatory clarity for digital assets and digital asset marketplaces to pass the house, and in a bipartisan fashion no less,\u201d said Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.",

Schumer went as far as deeming state election integrity efforts \u201cone of the greatest threats we have to modern democracy in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these voter suppression laws in Georgia and other Republican states smack of Jim Crow rearing its ugly head once again. It is 160 years since the 13, 14, and 15th amendments abolished slavery, and Jim Crow stills seems to be with us,\u201d Schumer said during last month\u2019s Senate Rules and Administration Committee hearing on S. 1, or the \u201cFor the People Act.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden referred to election integrity efforts pursued by GOP state legislators \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201csick,\u201d making \u201cJim Crow look like Jim Eagle.\u201d\n\nHowever, the vast majority of U.S. likely voters disagree with the Democrat narrative and do not consider basic election integrity measures, such as requiring valid photo identification to vote, as discriminatory in nature.\n\n\u201cDo laws requiring photo identification at the polls discriminate against some voters?\u201d the survey, taken April 11-12 among 1,000 likely U.S. voters, asked.\n\nA majority, or 62 percent, said no, 29 percent said yes, and nine percent indicated they remain unsure. Notably, 59 percent of black voters agree that requiring photo ID at the polls is not discriminatory, and 58 percent of those who did not identify as either black or white agreed.\n\nOpinions, unsurprisingly, are divided on party lines, as 79 percent of Republicans say voter ID is not discriminatory, compared to the plurality of Democrats, 46 percent, who disagreed. Forty-three percent of Democrats said voter ID is not discriminatory, putting the Democrat opinions \u2014 between agreeing and disagreeing \u2014 within the survey\u2019s +/- 3 percent margin of error.\n\nThe criticisms have come as Georgia passed an election integrity measure and Democrats in the House passed H.R. 1, or \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d which would nationalize elections, largely stripping states of their ability to implement basic election integrity measures such as voter ID and systems to clean the voter rolls.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, \u201cthe bill declares that photo ID, \u2018burdensome\u2019 voter registration procedures, purges of ineligible voters, restrictions on vote-by-mail, rules against felons voting, and other measures that states and municipalities have taken to guarantee the integrity of elections are, in fact, \u2018restrictions on the right to vote.'\u201d It also calls for nationwide vote-by-mail without a photo ID.\n\nOther polls, in recent weeks, have indicated majority support for voter ID measures.",

This landmark legislation is a critical step to improve safety for patients and healthcare providers by coordinating existing efforts within a single independent agency solely focused on addressing safety in health care through data-driven solutions.\n Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, medical error was the third leading cause of death in the United States, with conservative estimates of more than 250,000 patients dying annually from preventable medical harm and costs of more than $17 billion to the U.S. healthcare system Recent data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that patient safety worsened during the pandemic.\n  The National Patient Safety Board Act would create a National Patient Safety Board (NPSB), a nonpunitive, collaborative, independent agency modeled in part after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) to address safety in health care. The aviation industry has had a stellar safety record thanks to the work of the NTSB and CAST, which together have been improving and promoting transportation safety in the United States for more than 25 years. The NPSB would guarantee a data-driven, scalable approach to preventing and reducing patient safety events in healthcare settings.\n  The NPSB is designed to augment the work of federal agencies and long-standing patient safety organizations without displacing them. To support this role, the NPSB would also have a public\u2013private partnership team, the Healthcare Safety Team , to gain consensus on patient safety measures, autonomous data collection technologies, and solutions.",

Introduce Veterans for Mustangs Act Bill backed by Animal Wellness Action, Monty Roberts, and 80 plus groups seeks protect wild horses, help veterans, and save taxpayer dollars Reply\n\nSeveral wild mustang horses fighting and playing in the Nevada deserts. (Shutterstock Photo ID: 2059104068 )\n\nIn early February, U.S. Reps. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., Troy Carter, D-La, Barry Moore, R-Ala., and Dina Titus, D-Nev. introduced the Veterans for Mustangs Act, H.R. 726, with the support of eight Republicans and six Democrats. It\u2019s picking up more support by the day, with 20 cosponsors evenly divided by party in the U.S. House \u2013 the Chamber closest to the American people.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the measure is backed by an unlikely group of allies including House Natural Resources Wildlife Subcommittee Chairman Cliff Bentz, R-Ore., and House Natural Resources Public Lands Subcommittee Ranking Member Joe Neguse, D-Colo., as well as former House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert, R-Calif., and Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., the top equine protection advocate in Congress. The Veterans for Mustangs Act (VMA), which would amend the 1971 Wild and Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act to better protect American wild horses and burros on federal lands and provides avenues for healing American veterans with post-traumatic stress and other disorders resulting from combat. Under the Act, veterans would receive training and opportunities to engage on critical components of wild horse management efforts in the field.\n\nThe measure has been endorsed by more than 80 equine, veteran, and animal protection groups, including Veterans for Mustangs, Animal Wellness Action, the Animal Wellness Foundation, the Center for a Humane Economy, the Wild Beauty Foundation, the American Horse Protection Society, numerous American Legion Posts across the U.S., Monty Roberts (\u201cThe Man Who Listens to Horses\u201d) and Flag Is Up Farm, Horse Sense and Healing, War Horse Creek, Devil Dog Depot Equine Sanctuary and Rescue, and Wish for Our Heroes. Wild mustangs still roam our western lands and are a cherished part of our American Heritage. Despite being an iconic symbol of the American spirit, these majestic wild equids have been mismanaged by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which continues to round up the wild horse and burro population by helicopter, often resulting in injuries and deaths. Under the Biden Administration, the U.S. has seen more roundups and mass incarceration of wild horses than under any other Administration prior. While the agency touts helicopter stampedes as \u201chumane,\u201d hundreds of animals have been deliberately killed by the BLM, either during the roundups or in holding facilities, and hundreds more have been sold by unscrupulous adopters into the slaughter pipeline.\n\nThe current roundup system also bleeds the federal government of scarce tax dollars. Today, there are roughly 60,000 wild horses and burros in holding pens, and that number will likely double in the next few years, at a tremendous cost to the American taxpayer. H.R. 726 would create a new program to address these concerns, one that offers a more humane, fiscally responsible alternative to helicopter roundups. The program would save the taxpayer billions of dollars over the next 10 years and offer a unique form of healing for our American heroes \u2013 the U.S. veterans who have proudly served our country and risked their lives \u2013 by enabling them to be trained and subsequently administer fertility control to select herds of wild horses and burros located on federal lands and to obviate the need for inhumane and costly roundups.\n\nAmerican service members struggle deeply with the transition from war to civilian life. More than half of the 2.6 million veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars struggle with physical and mental health problems stemming from their service. On average, 22 soldiers kill themselves every day, which sadly is a higher death rate than at the height of the Iraq war. To put this in perspective, soldiers statistically are more likely to die at home from their own hand than in war at the hands of the enemy. Implementing humane fertility control is a way to maintain safe and sustainable population levels of wild horses where needed on our public lands. The PZP contraceptive vaccine has been recognized by the National Academy of Sciences as the most promising and cost-effective method for controlling the growth some wild horse populations. It\u2019s a humane solution that can be administered to mares via a dart injection. A dose is $30 and is administered once a year, becoming self-boosting after five to seven years. In comparison, it costs the American taxpayers an average of $50,000 to capture and care for a mare for her entire life.",

    "body": "When Erika Alexander (Living Single, John Lewis: Good Trouble) and Whitney Dow (Two Towns of Jasper, Whiteness Project) first set out to creat a prjct about reparations, they expected to make a thesis film about the debate surrounding H.R. 40, a 30-year-old Congressional bill that would establish a commission to study slavery and consider reparations for Black Americans. Plans shifted upon meeting Alderman Robin Rue Simmons and learning of her pursuit to pass the first government-funded reparations program in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe result became The Big Payback, a documentary that follows Simmons\u2019s efforts in Evanston and the fight to pass H.R. 40. Featuring interviews with Simmons, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), and other community leaders, The Big Payback is a view into the legislation behind reparations and how it affects communities on a local and national level. In an interview with Digital Trends, co-directors Alexander and Dow explain the definition of reparations and discuss the arguments for and against reparations, and as well as who should be responsible for paying the debt.\n\nNote: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDigital Trends: I want to start with the definition of reparations because most people believe it\u2019s just money. That does represent a huge portion of it, but after watching the documentary, you find out there are more elements to reparations than just the financials. To you, what is the definition of reparations?\n\nErika Alexander: Reparations is the making of amends for a wrong one has done by paying money to, [therefore] helping, those who have been wronged. Or compensation paid by a defeated state. That\u2019s really what it is. In this sense, it\u2019s reparations for the descendants of the enslaved Africans and their descendants by the U.S. government for harm, not only from slavery, but from Jim Crow policies, legislation, [and] all these things that have been interred in the American fabric. They would like them to see to it, address it, and give an apology with no conditions.\n\nWhitney Dow: Yeah, I just typed it in a GPT chat to see what it says [laughs]. It\u2019s the action of repairing a wrong. And I think it works in two directions. What\u2019s interesting about reparations, for me, is that it\u2019s really about repairing an injury. Whether it\u2019s making amends, making an apology, [or] making monetary payments, I think when people think of reparations, and Erika has talked about this a fair amount before, it\u2019s not just the idea of just repairing the injury to Black people, but it\u2019s repairing the relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s repairing the relationship between Black and White Americans. It also means repairing White people. As a White person, I believe you\u2019re living in a state of cognitive dissonance where you are trying to manage this story that you\u2019ve told about yourself, which has some holes in it. It\u2019s really hard to keep holding that in play, so I think that part of the repair is also for the White community to repair itself.\n\nHow did your partnership start on this project? When did you decide to partner?\n\nAlexander: Joy Reid. Do you want to tell the story, Whitney? The great Joy Reid is a friend of both of ours.\n\nDow: Yes. We both weirdly vectored through Joy Reid. I was talking to her, and Erika was talking to her, and she said, \u201cYou got to meet my friend Erika. She\u2019s interested in reparations.\u201d And she said, \u201cErika, you don\u2019t want to meet my friend Whitney [laughs].\u201d We met, and we really hit it off. I think one of the interesting parts of this thing, and I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it, is this work is really hard.\n\nWorking on a subject as complex and fraught as race relations is hard. Working on a subject about reparations is even harder, but working on it in a shared control capacity across race and across gender creates a lot of challenges. I was lucky enough to have a partner in Erika. Sometimes, it\u2019s more important to have shared goals than shared motivations. I think that we always had the same shared goal. And Joy, for whatever reason, saw that in us when she put us together.\n\nThis project started with the congressional reparations hearing in 2019 with Rep. Jackson Lee and H.R. 40. For people who may not understand the specifics or intent of the bill, what is H.R. 40?\n\nAlexander: H.R. 40 is a study bill that\u2019s in Congress. It was first introduced by Congressman John Conyers [D-Michigan] as a bill to study reparations and their effects. And to make recommendations \u2026\n\nDow: For appropriate remedies.\n\nAlexander: For appropriate remedies. By the way, that was going to be the name of this film, Appropriate Remedies. It was that or The Big Payback. Whitney wanted Appropriate Remedies, and I wanted The Big Payback.\n\nDow: I didn\u2019t want to scare White people. I was like, \u201cThe Big Payback? The Big Payback\u2019s coming. Holy shit! Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d [laughs]\n\nAlexander: But you know what I said? I said, \u201cScare White people? You scaring everybody off. Nobody wants to see a movie called Appropriate Remedies.\u201d I said this sounds like a drug for constipation. So I said, \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do that here.\u201d Just so you know, Dan, how we solve things, because of reparations, I always win. That\u2019s just what it\u2019s going to be. Appropriate Remedies. Lord? Mm [shakes head]. That\u2019s what H.R. 40 is. It\u2019s been stuck there for 30 years, and Sheila Jackson Lee moved it for at least a House vote.\n\nDow: We got access to the Judiciary Committee hearings. We got access to film the markup session of the bill. We filmed the debate in the markup session, and it was voted out of committee. It was not only the first time it was voted out, but it was the first time it was even brought to a vote.\n\nJohn Conyers would submit this bill for 30 years. The committee would refuse to even take it up for debate, let alone a vote. Representative Jackson Lee managed to not only get it voted out of committee but also has close to 200, if not over 200, co-sponsors on the bill. It\u2019s just a question of whether the leadership will bring it to the floor. We\u2019ll see if [Republican House Speaker] Kevin McCarthy wants to bring this to the floor.\n\nAlexander: That\u2019s why they\u2019re looking for an executive order from [President Joe] Biden to bypass that and get on with it.\n\nThe Big Payback | Official Trailer | Independent Lens | PBS\n\nDo you think it will ever happen while Biden\u2019s in office?\n\nAlexander: I think it must happen. I don\u2019t know if it will ever happen. That\u2019s a good question. Everything is a political calculation, and I can see why he avoided it before these past elections. After a while, especially for Black people, they\u2019re looking at it like you can\u2019t keep pushing this to the side. Not only is it not fair, but it\u2019s wrong.\n\nNo one should be that afraid or calculate that it might harm them the most if they did it. It\u2019s already harming not only Black people but all sorts of people. Poor people and all these other people have been harmed by policies that they put in to stop or deny Black people, but it ended up denying poor Whites and everyone else, so it needs to be handled.\n\nWhile filming in 2019, you get this message about Alderman Robin Rue Simmons, someone who is tackling reparations at a local level in Evanston. Take me through how and why you decided to shift the point of view to Alderwoman Simmons.\n\nDow: Well, when we really started making the film, it was a very, very different film. It was more of a thesis film. It was shooting a lot of people in the studio on a green screen. It was going to have animation and archival [footage] and a B-roll. We were going to use the debate around H.R. 40 as a bit of a narrative engine to carry it through. About a few months into filming, one of our producers saw this article on Robin Rue Simmons that she had passed this bill. There was going to be an event that opened the film at the church, where they announced this program to the community.\n\nWe jumped on a plane and flew out there, put a crew together, and started filming. We said to ourselves that we were really making a film about how history manifests in the present. Well, here is actual history being made in the present, so it really became a way of doing this micro and macro story. We have this national story taking place at a glacial pace, and then we have this representational local story that allowed us to really unpack the details of how something like this works.\n\nWhat stood out about Alderman Simmons during this process? When did you know you made the right decision to shift the film toward her work?\n\nAlexander: I think we did know right away: She is extraordinary. She has a beautiful way about her, and it\u2019s easy. But she was also very honest. Very soon after we arrived, she said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know if I should do this.\u201d But she knew she wanted to do this for the community. They needed to know how it was documented.\n\nEven though she was hesitant as a person, she understood her place in history right away. This was going to be something extraordinary. She also naively thought, \u201cOh. I\u2019m going to do this, and then the cameras will go away. It will all be over, and I\u2019ll be back to my old life.\u201d We looked at her and laughed and said, \u201cIs she crazy? She\u2019s the Rosa Parks of reparations.\u201d\n\nI was sad for her because she would never have that again. She could never go back. You can never put all that in the box. At all times, she would say that she was worried about how she was coming off, not out of any ego, but because she wanted people to know where her anxiety was.\n\nI thought that type of honesty should be \u2014 and I think Whitney did as well \u2014 rewarded with us always being honest with her. We had a really great dialogue going back and forth as filmmakers to a woman who was becoming, like Michelle Obama would say, \u201cliving out loud,\u201d under a lot of pressure, allowing us to watch her.\n\nA common argument against reparations would be when people say, \u201cThere weren\u2019t my crimes. Why should I be the one to pay that debt?\u201d How do you approach those people and counter those viewpoints to explain where you\u2019re coming from?\n\nDow: What did Falkner say? \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d It isn\u2019t. There are two ways that I approach it. One is that the data is incontrovertible. If you look at the data trends \u2014 wealth, education levels, mortgage rates, health, or death rates \u2014 there is an intransient gap between Black and White Americans. Some of the data I\u2019m sure you probably know is that White Americans have up to 11 to 14 times the wealth of Black Americans.\n\nThis idea that somehow this magically happened \u2026 of course, the past exists in the present. That was actually what we first set out to really try and see. A documentary is relatively simple. It\u2019s hard to do complex things. A book could be written about it. A really complex book about how Evanston systematically excluded Black Evanstonians from participating civically and participating in the institutions and things that allowed them to build wealth.\n\nImagine a poker game where people have been cheating. You\u2019ve been playing against someone who has been cheating for like 400 years, and you catch them cheating. They go, \u201cOh, yeah. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. That was so bad. I was cheating. I admit I was cheating. Cheating is terrible. I\u2019m never going to cheat again. But now, you can\u2019t cheat, either. You all have to play by the rules, and I\u2019m keeping all the chips.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s kind of the situation we\u2019re in. The chips have been gathered on this side of the table. In the 1960s and 1970s, White Americans made this idea like, \u201cWe\u2019ll pass civil rights. We agree that this is bad, but we\u2019re still not willing to compensate for the cheating we did over those decades and centuries.\u201d\n\nWho should pay the reparations? Does this fall squarely upon the federal government?\n\nAlexander: Whitney will talk about the corporate end, and I will talk about the government. Yes, it is the government\u2019s debt to pay. Let\u2019s be clear about that. We are in America, and they were the ones who allowed these things to happen for so long to specific people and then, afterward, allowed corporations and all sorts of other institutions to create laws and legislation directly against Black Americans.\n\nIt still goes on to this day. You look at the redlining now, but also what they do with the voting in the polls and all that stuff. It still goes on. I hate to say it, but it\u2019s destroying not Black people, [but] it\u2019s destroying America. The debt is theirs to pay. I should say ours to pay, [or] hers [America] to pay. And we\u2019re looking forward to her figuring it out.\n\nDow: What I really like about this film is that it addresses both questions. Yes, I believe there\u2019s a national debt to pay, and that is the federal government. The federal government benefited through taxes. The federal government created the policies that created some of these injuries and inequities. But it\u2019s also local communities\u2019 responsibility to look at their own place in the paradigm, their own place in the equation, and decide the specific way that this has manifested itself here.\n\nIn Evanston, it happened to be around redlining real estate. If you went to Jackson, Mississippi, it might be something different. If you go to San Diego, California, it\u2019s something different. What I like about this story is communities saying, to answer that earlier question you asked, \u201cYeah. I wasn\u2019t involved in slavery, but this echo of legacy passed through every community in this country.\u201d I think it\u2019s a productive exercise and healing of sorts, and an exercise that will make a more positive, stronger community if you examine your role and how it manifests in your community.\n\nSo Evanston came up with this idea of saying this is how it manifested here, so this is how it needs to be addressed.\u201d Your question about who should pay. One of the most interesting things, it\u2019s funded by a tax on legal marijuana. She [Simmons] saw this opportunity for this new tax.\n\nWhite people used to say when I would meet in Evanston that they\u2019re so proud of this, [and] so proud of Evanston that they\u2019re doing this reparations program. I said,\u201d What are you proud about? You didn\u2019t propose this thing. You didn\u2019t pass this thing.\u201d It\u2019s a syntax. If you don\u2019t buy weed, it doesn\u2019t touch you. How and why are you proud?\n\nOne of the things that happened recently, which makes me really excited, is they created a property tax that they\u2019re now going to add to the fund. That, to me, is a much more interesting way to do it. If this is Evanston\u2019s problem, everybody should contribute to the reparations to try and create healing.\n\nInitially, I think it was a good way in. You know, get your foot in the door first. Then they try and slam it, but you get the body in a little farther, and I think that\u2019s by opening that door. What Robin did, and we\u2019ve said this a number of times before, is that she showed that the impossible was possible. It\u2019s like the four-minute mile. Once you break it, that time keeps coming down. So once she showed that it was possible, all things are possible in this realm.\n\nAlexander: I do have to say, Whitney, that they did send representation, and they did pass it from a mostly White council, which is, to me, extraordinary. We have to give Evanston props for that. Also, knowing that it\u2019s a moral debt that America must pay, and in that way, that\u2019s more of a reckoning in people\u2019s hearts, to keep denying that not being there is a reason why they shouldn\u2019t pay. Well, the Japanese were put into internment camps, and then in 1988, they actually did pay reparations to the tune of about $1.6 billion once it was all spread out. They at least looked at that and got that done.\n\nYou can\u2019t keep pushing this down the hill because of age. The slaves had no rights. They had no representation. So to say they should have gotten it done, I\u2019m like, \u201cHow? How could they have gotten it done when everybody around them hated them and was hunting them and using them, not just for work, but for whatever they wanted? We have to go, \u201cOf course, they didn\u2019t have any way to create this, but we do, so let\u2019s figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe Big Payback makes its television debut on PBS\u2019 Emmy award-winning documentary anthology series Independent Lens to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day at 10 p.m. ET on January 16, 2023 (check local listings).

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\n\nWASHINGTON - The House passed legislation banning the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China Thursday.\n\nThe bill passed 331-97, as members from both sides of the aisle rally around an increasingly protectionist stance against China, the world's second largest economy.\n\nThe Biden administration has sold record amounts of oil out of the petroleum reserve, to counteract energy price spikes following the war in Ukraine and the rise in economic activity coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a speech on the House floor Thursday, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said millions of barrels of crude from those sales had ended up in China.\n\n\"Draining our strategic reserves for political purposes and selling it to China is a significant threat to our national and energy security,\" she said. \"This must be stopped, which is why I\u2019m proud to join my Republican colleagues in passing H.R. 22, one of the most bipartisan votes on an energy bill in many years.\"\n\nUnder existing federal law, the Department of Energy is required to sell oil from the reserve, which is located in underground salt caves in Texas and Louisiana, to the highest bidder, according to a department spokesperson.\n\n\"The Biden administration, like administrations of both parties have historically done, rightly authorized emergency use of the SPR mission to address supply disruptions,\" the spokesperson said. \"Since 2017 the vast majority of oil sold from the reserve is sold to American entities.\u201d\n\nSen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, introduced similar legislation last summer, which is currently under review in the senate energy committee.\n\n\"China cannot be allowed to profit from our emergency energy reserves,\" he said. \"Now that the House has acted, the Senate should move to take up legislation to ban such sales.\u201d",

    "body": "as the For The People Act, with a series of amendments from the version of the bill that the House passed in March. The expected changes are not all that dramatic, including adding waivers for automatic registration rules, easing same-day registration requirements and scaling back a 15-day early voting requirement of small jurisdictions. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right No one should be under the illusion that these amendments will persuade any Republicans to support a voting-rights bill. They instead appear to be designed to address complaints from Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), the sole Democrat who has not co-sponsored the bill and who has raised concerns about the lack of flexibility for local voting officials. He seems firmly opposed to dramatic voting reform, but it is unclear what voting provisions he would support. If, as some voting-rights advocates suspect, he is looking to be an obstacle to preserve his standing in a conservative state, they are wasting their time trying to accommodate his demands. Rather than throwing out proposals with the hope to get Manchin's buy-in, perhaps it is time to force him to show his hand. What voting reform is he prepared to accept? (It is bizarre, frankly, that Democrats are obsessing about going too far to protect voting rights.) Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Let's say for the sake of argument that Manchin is operating in good faith and would support a limited but substantial list of voting reforms (e.g., independent redistricting, guaranteed early and no-excuse absentee voting, a mandatory paper trail subject to audit) and H.R. 4, which would reauthorize preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act. He would then still need 10 Republican votes, which he seems to think can emerge from open debate and negotiation. Manchin almost certainly will not find 10 Republicans willing to acknowledge that the problem is not voting fraud but voting restrictions. Given that House Republicans are about to excommunicate one of their leaders for refusing to go along with the Big Lie that the election was stolen, I would guess the task of finding any Republican senator who is willing to dispense with the lie about voting fraud and circumvent state legislatures seeking to suppress voting is virtually impossible. (Are there even 10 Republicans to support a stand-alone H.R. 4?) That means Manchin will have to make a decision that he seems determined to avoid: If no voting rights bill will ever garner 10 Republican votes, what is he prepared to do about it? The answer may be \u201cnothing.\u201d He currently enjoys cover to avoid tough votes (on voting reform and anything else) if the 60-vote cloture rule remains in place. So long as the filibuster makes passage of controversial bills impossible, he need not go up against home-state conservatives on any issue. He could, of course, support a limited exception to the filibuster (as reconciliation has done) to requires a simple majority to pass legislation that entails constitutional protections, but it is far from clear that would pass muster with him. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Manchin must surely realize that Democratic voters, donors and activists \u2014 as well as his fellow officeholders \u2014 will not accept a senator who refuses to defend voting rights in the midst of an onslaught of Jim Crow-style legislation. Voting rights and protection of multiracial democracy are so fundamental to the ethos of the party (more so than abortion rights, taxes or any other topic) that Manchin risks an irreparable breach with his fellow Democrats should he refuse to block the Republicans' assault on voting rights. (Many Democrats would support a primary challenge against Manchin, even at the risk of losing the seat, if he impedes voting rights reform.) Democrats should make clear that party members cannot remain in good standing unless they prioritize voting rights over the filibuster. If the red line for Republicans is embrace of the Big Lie, the red line for Democrats is embrace of the Big Truth \u2014 namely that democracy is imperiled by Jim Crow-style legislation. Ultimately, Manchin will have to decide whether he stands with advocates of voter suppression or his own party.

    "body": "Tuesday marks 100 years since the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre \u2014 an act of city-sanctioned white violence that murdered up to 300 Black men, women and children, destroyed the Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and then was erased from history.\n\nBefore a white mob tore into Greenwood, it was a safe haven for Black people to live and thrive. It was known as Black Wall Street \u2014 a testament to its cultural, social and economic strength.\n\nMy grandfather Raymond Beard Sr. and great-aunt and great-uncle, Mary and Matthew Beard, lived and worked in Greenwood. Thankfully, they survived the massacre, but they didn't escape unscathed. My family's home and laundry business were burned to ashes.\n\nWe learned later that my great-uncle and great-aunt fled to Los Angeles, where they changed their first names to conceal their identities. Like many survivors, they carried the weight of the massacre for the rest of their lives, unable to shake flashbacks and memories of screaming, the smell of smoke and fire, the image of white men murdering Black people right in front of their eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, local and state officials destroyed documentation of the massacre, newspaper records were deleted, and the perpetrators and aggressors established a culture of silence. A full century after the massacre, no one has been held accountable, and neither the last known living survivors nor my family and other descendants are any closer to justice.\n\nToday, the Greenwood community is held back in nearly every measure, including health, education, jobs, economic opportunity, housing and criminal justice. Black youths are three times more likely to be arrested than white youths in Tulsa. The presence of more payday lenders and fewer banks and credit unions in North Tulsa, where the majority of Black Tulsans live, limits our ability to accumulate wealth. The Black infant mortality rate in Tulsa is almost three times that of white Tulsans.\n\nWe cannot tolerate the consequences of the Tulsa Race Massacre any longer, so I recently joined the last three living survivors of the massacre, as well as other descendants, to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. We are calling for reparations to address the pain and trauma still felt by our community.\n\nThe best way to unravel the traumas inflicted by this nation starts with an honest reckoning of systemic racism through passage of H.R. 40. Introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, this bill is a transformative framework to begin a national conversation focused on acknowledging, studying, confronting and atoning for our dark history. It would establish a commission to examine slavery and discrimination and their impacts from 1619 to today, as well as develop reparation proposals.\n\nWhile critics may be quick to write off this proposal as too expensive or too politically charged, they clearly do not grasp the magnitude of current traumas shouldered by the Black community.\n\nAt 107 years old, Mother Fletcher, the oldest living survivor of the massacre, has waited long enough for justice. She lost her chance to have an education after the massacre, never finishing school past the fourth grade. To this day, she struggles to afford her basic everyday needs and has flashbacks of the screams, the Black bodies lying in the street, the neighborhood businesses burning. The clock is ticking to ensure that she receives reparations in her lifetime.\n\nIn October, I stood in the trench of a mass grave at Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa as part of my duties as a member of the city's Mass Graves Investigation Public Oversight Committee. As we uncovered 12 coffins, I noticed a smaller box about the size of a woman's hat box. The Tulsa Race Riot Commission report concluded that inside was most likely a stillborn baby.\n\nThese bodies weren't embalmed, and their death certificates weren't even signed by a medical examiner. They were thrown away like garbage. I walked away from this grave and wept for the soul of this child and the mother who would never know her baby's whereabouts, lost both in the womb and in the earth.\n\nTime has not and will not heal these wounds. The only way to truly move forward is to tackle the darkness of our past head on. As we approach the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, there can be no better way to honor the survivors and descendants than by passing H.R. 40 to begin a long overdue national reckoning.",

NACDS welcomes the Biden Administration's action, which is critical for retail pharmacies of all formats and sizes,\" said NACDS President and CEO Steven C. Anderson.\n\n\"We will continue to engage and we will comment formally to help make the most of this moment. We also look forward to working with the administration, with Congress and with other key stakeholders for the establishment of consistent, relevant and workable pharmacy quality measures that are essential to the success of true DIR fee reform.\"\n\nThe Biden Administration's action came in the form of a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed rule for Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs. Released on January 6, 2022, the proposed rule is scheduled to be published on January 12, 2022, in the Federal Register.\n\nThe proposed rule would have the practical effect of preventing the needless inflation of seniors' out-of-pocket drug costs that results from a current regulatory loophole. This same loophole jeopardizes pharmacy viability with unpredictable and often below-cost payments from payers to pharmacies for the medications that they dispense.\n\n\"NACDS expresses deep appreciation to the sponsors of the Pharmacy DIR Reform to Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act (S. 1909/H.R. 3554) in this Congress \u2013 and to those who have helped lead the charge for DIR fee reform in prior Congresses,\" Anderson said. \"We look forward to their continued leadership and engagement throughout the regulatory process and to address any and all remaining legislative needs.\"\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-MT), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) introduced the bill in the Senate; while Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT), Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA), Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), Rep. John Rose (R-TN), Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), and Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) introduced a similar bill in the House. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) has championed DIR fee reform in his leadership capacity, as has former Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA).\n\nThe reforms proposed by CMS are estimated to reduce seniors' costs by $21.3 billion over 10 years. CMS states pharmacy DIR fees grew more than 107,400 percent between 2010 and 2020.\n\nThe Administration also issued a press release and fact sheet about the proposal, which would take effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nIs there a problem with this press release?

He died as a result of his wounds. Cashe was awarded a Silver Star for his heroism, but it took a new law, which was signed by then-President Donald Trump, to exempt his case from a deadline for a Medal of Honor.\n\nCeliz is being honored for his actions in Afghanistan in 2018. While clearing an area of enemy forces, the unit Celiz led came under enemy fire. He exposed himself to enemy fire more than once, including when he used his body as a shield for an injured person he loaded into a medical evacuation helicopter and guarded it as it took off without him. As he faced gunshots, he waved the aircraft off, telling them to leave without him. Celiz died of his injuries on a later evacuation flight.\n\nPlumlee, the only living Medal of Honor recipient for Thursday's ceremony, will be awarded for his actions in Afghanistan in 2013. After insurgents bombed a perimeter wall at Forward Operating Base Ghazni and attempted to move in, Plumlee and other drove toward the explosion.

    "body": "But it passed the Senate by the barest of margins, and only after Democrats used the arcane \u201creconciliation\u201d procedure, which enabled them to advance the bill with just 50 votes, avoiding a Republican filibuster. Meanwhile, other important legislation is piling up at the Senate's door. The House last week passed H.R. 1 , a major election reform bill that would ease voting \u2014 an antidote to Republicans' efforts in many states to make voting more difficult. Though improving access to the ballot box should be a bipartisan priority, the legislation faces strong GOP opposition, and Democrats likely cannot use reconciliation to skirt the filibuster's 60-vote requirement to impose minimum national voting standards. Similarly, Democrats seek to advance this year a generational investment in infrastructure and climate change programs, both major needs that Congress has long neglected. But the pervasive use of the filibuster, which Republicans practiced during the Obama administration, limits what Democrats can do without 10 Republican senators. To some Senate traditionalists, this is a feature, not a bug. The Senate at its best is a crucible of compromise. The filibuster is a powerful tool senators in the minority can use to force the majority to negotiate with them. Ideally, the two parties would strike bargains on voting rights, infrastructure, climate and other critical issues, which would make the resulting policy more broadly appealing and politically durable. Yet we find ourselves a long way from the ideal. In today's climate, the filibuster has become a tool more of obstruction than compromise. Once sparingly used, the filibuster in its current form imposes a de facto 60-vote threshold on almost all legislation, enabling 41 senators representing a fraction of the country's population to routinely block all sorts of broadly popular bills with hardly the lift of a finger. The result has been policy gridlock, which is infuriating in calmer times and dangerous now. The Jan. 6 riot , the lies that fueled it and the Republican Party's anti-democratic turn show that democracy is under threat. The world is running out of time to avoid devastating climate change. Senate rules should be rebalanced, not just in an attempt to address these issues, but also to build a more functional Senate for the long term. Key Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) oppose abolishing the filibuster, but, as Mr. Manchin noted on Sunday, there are a variety of filibuster reforms senators could consider that would make the maneuver harder to use. Senators could be required to speak without interruption on the Senate floor to sustain their filibusters, which would reflect the filibuster's roots in the rules regarding legislative debate. Senators could be forced to sustain filibusters by producing enough votes to continue debate, rather than keeping the onus on the majority to gather enough senators to break filibusters. Rules could be shifted such that it required only three-fifths of present and voting senators to end a filibuster, rather than three-fifths of all senators. These are only a few of the ideas circulating. The filibuster has changed before, and it can change again. Mr. Manchin is right: Democrats should be examining reform. Republicans, meanwhile, should seek a settlement that relaxes the filibuster straitjacket while preserving some minority influence. Read more: Paul Waldman: Joe Manchin's plan is working perfectly.

    "body": "What would have happened if the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, had responded, \u201cOK, I'll try,\u201d in a January phone call after President Trump asked him to \u201cfind\u201d 11,000 votes? No one can be sure. What is clear is that the question has been overlooked in recent months. Public attention has mostly moved on from Mr. Trump's bid to overturn the election; activists and politicians are focused more on whether to restrict or expand voting access, particularly by mail. But trying to reverse an election result without credible evidence of widespread fraud is an act of a different magnitude than narrowing access. A successful effort to subvert an election would pose grave and fundamental risks to democracy, risking political violence and secessionism. Beyond any provisions on voting itself, the new Georgia election law risks making election subversion easier. It creates new avenues for partisan interference in election administration. This includes allowing the state elections board, now newly controlled by appointees of the Republican State Legislature, to appoint a single person to take control of typically bipartisan county election boards, which have important power over vote counting and voter eligibility. Advertisement The law also gives the Legislature the authority to appoint the chair of the state election board and two more of its five voting members, allowing it to appoint a majority of the board. It strips the secretary of state of the chair and a vote. Even without this law, there would still be a risk of election subversion: Election officials and administrators all over the country possess important powers, including certification of election results, that could be abused in pursuit of partisan gain. And it's a risk that H.R. 1, the reform bill congressional Democrats are pushing, does relatively little to address. The new Georgia law does not inherently make it easier to \u201cfind\u201d 11,000 votes. Almost all of the powers that the Legislature might use already existed \u2014 they were just vested in other people or bodies. They could have been abused before and could be in the future, regardless of the new law. And the law has eligibility requirements for a chair that exclude many of the sort of people who would seem likeliest to abuse their authority, including anyone who has been a political candidate, campaign contributor or party organizer in the two years before the appointment. This is not guaranteed to preclude a rabid partisan leading the board, but no such checks had existed on the secretary of state. (Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, previously served in the Georgia House of Representatives.) The law takes power from the very person, Mr. Raffensperger, who a mere three months ago rebuffed Mr. Trump's plea to find 11,000 votes. State legislators demoted Mr. Raffensperger for a reason: Many were probably sympathetic to Mr. Trump's allegations. And if the Legislature had a problem with how Mr. Raffensperger handled the 2020 election, it is reasonable to wonder whether it might have supported board members aggressively backing the claims advanced by Mr. Trump. Advertisement Can state boards, county boards or anyone else use their administrative powers to flip electoral outcomes? After the November election, a majority of Republican members of Congress and state attorneys general signed on to efforts that would have invalidated millions of votes and brought about a constitutional crisis. With that backdrop, it seems na\u00efve to assume that no one would try to abuse such power, whether in Georgia or elsewhere. It's worth going back to Mr. Trump's infamous call. While the oft-quoted line about \u201cfinding\u201d votes makes it sound as if he wanted Mr. Raffensperger to manufacture votes out of thin air, Mr. Trump said he had already found the votes, in the form of thousands of ballots he said were cast illegally: \u201cWe have all the votes we need. You know, we won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. You know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number.\u201d In addition to the 4,925 out-of-state voters mentioned, Mr. Trump baselessly asserted in the call that there were hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots with forged signatures. He alleged, based on imperfect matches between lists of voters, that there were 4,502 voters who voted but weren't registered; 18,325 voters with vacant addresses; 904 voters who voted only with a P.O. box address; and nearly 5,000 votes by dead people. And with virtually no evidence whosever, he alleged great malfeasance in Atlanta's Fulton County, including 18,000 votes having to do with someone who did something nefarious and \u201c3,000 pounds\u201d of shredded ballots. County and state election officials hold a variety of powers relevant to such claims. They evaluate whether to accept or reject ballots, and they certify results. In Georgia, they hear eligibility challenges. It would have been hard to employ these powers to aid Mr. Trump, let alone to survive a subsequent court challenge. But there are levers that they could have at least tried to pull, even if it's not clear what would have come of it. One option is that the state board could have usurped the power of Fulton County, based on the president's allegations in the general election and other allegations from the primary (the law requires evidence of failed administration in at least two elections over the prior two years). The state board could have either used the president's allegations as a basis to refuse to certify the result or to disqualify otherwise eligible voters. It would be hard or even impossible to pull this off immediately after an election. The law requires a fairly drawn-out hearing process before the state can interfere in county elections. The preliminary hearing can't be held for at least 30 days after an initial petition, which is after the Georgia certification deadline. But perhaps a nefarious board could lay the groundwork earlier, potentially putting a newly appointed superintendent in control before the elections, when he or she would have the ability to pre-emptively disqualify voters and ballots. County election boards heard similar kinds of challenges to voter eligibility during the Georgia runoff. The state Republican Party and a Texas group challenged the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of voters in December, based on whether a voter appeared to match someone on the Postal Service list of people in the National Change of Address Registry. A few small counties actually went through with trying to invalidate voters on this basis. This eligibility challenge was rejected by the U.S. District Court Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner, who happens to be the sister of Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 governor's race in Georgia to Brian Kemp. But although the eligibility challenge faltered in the runoff, it is not obvious that ironclad protections exist against eligibility challenges, either as a matter of court precedent or federal law. A narrower challenge could have had a better chance of surviving a court challenge. And the new Georgia law makes these kinds of challenges easier, by allowing a single person to challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of voters. Advertisement Another option to thwart an election might be to stop certification. The new Georgia law does not do much to make it easier to block certification, as the secretary of state \u2014 not the board or the Legislature \u2014 still certifies results statewide. But county election boards, including in Georgia, generally certify their election results, which the secretary of state then certifies statewide. Mr. Trump tried to thwart efforts to certify the results certification, turning routine hearings into televised events. In the end, Mr. Trump's effort failed. Election officials overwhelmingly acted to preserve the integrity of the election, despite immense political pressure to act. Even so, the president did manage to persuade a handful of officials to vote against certification on dubious grounds. If secretaries of state had not certified election results, whether in Georgia or elsewhere, it might have plunged the country into crisis with uncertain consequences. It is not unreasonable to wonder whether there's a chance of something similar occurring in the future, given how many House Republicans refused to certify the electoral count. Election administrators may have other options to undermine elections, besides disqualifying ballots and voters or decertifying the results, either in Georgia or in other states. All of this represents an obvious threat to American democracy. And yet the risk of election subversion has been overshadowed by the fight over new restrictions on voting, especially by mail. Progressives have been concerned about these kinds of restrictions for years, and the reform bill H.R. 1 was written in part as a response. But since the law was mainly devised before the 2020 election, its provisions don't directly address the new risk that election officials could subvert election results. There's no provision, for instance, requiring nonpartisan administration or certification of federal elections. H.R. 1 does have provisions that would indirectly limit the options available to actors who might try to subvert elections. One notable example is a provision against voter caging, which precludes eligibility challenges based on matched lists, like the change of address notification challenge attempted in December. It also includes provisions that ensure basic election administration, like requiring that people don't wait in line longer than 30 minutes. But with the main focus of the proposed law being to improve democracy, by expanding voting access and more, it is not at all obvious whether H.R. 1 amounts to a comprehensive effort to protect democracy. And even if it does have the protections it needs, the risk of election subversion has received such little attention that relevant provisions might not be included in a slimmed-down bill . Those provisions have not been mentioned in most proposals for a narrower bill.",

But this flight out of Austin had a different purpose \u2013\u00a0a quorum-busting walkout to prevent a vote on an election integrity bill designed to safeguard elections in the Lone Star State, It was the second such walkout; Democrats deployed the same tactic in May at the end of Texas\u2019 regular biennial session.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe main point triggering the walkout? Requiring voters who vote by mail to write down one of three government-issued ID numbers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a driver\u2019s license, state ID or last four of the Social Security number\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inside a privacy flap on their ballot return envelope to ensure that the vote cast in their name is actually from them.\nTUCKER CARLSON: TEXAS FREEDOM FIGHTER DEMOCRATS FLED TO DC IN A MOVE EVEN PUTIN WOULDN'T ATTEMPT\nToday, only a signature match is required, as determined by a county signature verification committee that always has a two-to-one partisan balance and thus is subject to the whims of political subjectivity.\u00a0\u00a0\nEvery state legislature has rules for a quorum \u2013 typically enshrined in the state constitution. Of the 50 states, 45 only require half the chamber to be present to constitute a quorum.\u00a0Four more, including Texas, require two-thirds of the legislature to be present, and Massachusetts is alone in allowing quorum with only two-fifths of the Senate and three-eighths of the House.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\u00a0\nQuorum rules are designed to prevent abuse by a majority of lawmakers who, without such protections, could convene a snap session and debate and pass legislation without input from the minority.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut in this case, the requirements for a quorum are being exploited for a different purpose\u00a0\u2013 to prevent consideration of legislation by shutting down a duly called special session of the Texas Legislature. Lawmakers have abandoned their posts and walked off their jobs. For any of the rest of us, that would constitute a fire-able offense. But these lawmakers \u2013 and their fans in the major media \u2013 see themselves as heroes in the cause of voting rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut are Texas Democrats heroes\u00a0\u2013 or are they fighting for a bad cause?\u00a0\u00a0\nDemocrats, both nationally and in Texas, want to radically remake our election laws, erasing state voter ID laws, making it impossible to verify citizenship for voter eligibility, degrading the quality of voter lists, and dramatically expanding mail-in voting with minimal safeguards against fraudulent ballots.\u00a0\u00a0\nPart of the reason Texas Democrats fled to D.C. was to promote their party\u2019s counter to election integrity laws being passed in states such as Georgia and Florida, with Texas on the verge of passing similar legislation.\u00a0\u00a0\nCalifornia is the template for this effort. There, the entire election system runs on an honor system, with no official ID required to register or vote, and with 87% of the ballots cast by mail. At the federal level, the plan to California-ize the nation\u2019s elections is known as H.R.1 and S.1. H.R.1, the deceptively named, For the People Act, passed the U.S. House on March 3. It stalled in the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans hold a 50-50 balance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTexans want their elected lawmakers to work, not walk.\u00a0\u00a0\n The problem with imposing California election standards (meaning no standards) on the nation is that people don\u2019t like it. In Texas, 89% of voters\u00a0\u2013 including majorities of Black, Hispanic and Democrat voters\u00a0\u2013 support presenting an official ID to vote; 81% support requiring some form of ID to vote by mail; 89% support audits of voter lists to ensure dead voters, people who have moved out of state or non-citizens aren\u2019t registered; and 83% support protections to ensure poll watchers can\u2019t be prevented from doing their jobs. \u00a0\nMost importantly, by a two to one margin, Texans reject the Democrats\u2019 flight out of state. Texans want their elected lawmakers to work, not walk.\u00a0\u00a0\nDemocrats say that there is no election fraud in Texas. But the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office has convicted 140 people for election fraud since 2005, with 44 open election fraud cases pending. More than half of the convictions involved mail-in ballot fraud. And, for about 10 of the 16 years in question, those prosecutions were obtained with only one part-time prosecutor. Today, the AG\u2019s office has three prosecutors working to ensure free and fair elections in a state of some 30 million people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, will Texas Democrats continue their walkout indefinitely? Likely not. That\u2019s because 2021 is a redistricting year and, in Texas, when the Legislature fails to draw new legislative lines during their first general session, the Legislative Redistricting Board takes over.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThis five-member body is composed of the lieutenant governor, speaker of the house, attorney general, comptroller and commissioner of the general land office\u00a0\u2013 Republicans all. Their decisions on where to draw the lines can potentially end the careers of dozens of lawmakers, who, in Texas, aren\u2019t term limited.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe pending work of the Legislative Redistricting Board may serve as a powerful inducement to return to the work of legislating, especially for Democratic lawmakers with seniority.

Greg Abbott is likely to add additional charges to the special session call such as consideration of $5 billion in property tax buy-downs.\u00a0\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHUCK DeVORE",

But Congress could set national voting standards for federal elections \u2014 such as requiring all states to conduct early voting, mail-in voting, automatic voter registration or nonpartisan congressional district map-drawing. House Democrats have already approved such a bill, known as H.R. 1 . But the bill faces a certain filibuster in the Senate, where many Republicans oppose even what should be uncontroversial measures to make voting simpler and fairer. So Mr. Biden argued that the filibuster, which he called a relic of the Jim Crow era, must be reformed. The president proposed forcing senators to talk on the floor to sustain their filibusters. And if that does not work, he said, \u201cthen we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about.\u201d He had, he said \u201can open mind\u201d about setting aside the filibuster for \u201cthings that are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy,\u201d such as \u201cthe right to vote.\u201d Democrats should not undertake filibuster reform lightly. Mr. Biden rightly encouraged Senate Democrats to start cautiously, with adjustments that may reduce the ease of obstruction in the Senate. But Mr. Biden's plea for reform reflected a vision bigger than passing a single bill. Filibuster reform may itself show that democracy can work. Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cthinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can't function in an ever-complex world,\u201d Mr. Biden said . Renovating and hardening the nation's voting infrastructure and reforming the Senate so as to be more responsive to national challenges would show that the United States can respond to competition from Mr. Xi or any other despot who believes freedom is an unnecessary risk.

    "body": "A number of Senate Republicans are lining up to oppose two pieces of immigration legislation, both passed by House Democrats and a handful of House Republicans, that would provide amnesty to millions of illegal aliens living in the United States.\n\nLast week, the Democrat-controlled House \u2014 with support from 30 House Republicans \u2014 passed H.R. 1603, known as the \u201cFarm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021,\u201d and H.R. 6, known as \u201cAmerican Dream and Promise Act of 2021.\u201d The so-called \u201cFarmworker Amnesty\u201d and \u201cDream Act Amnesty\u201d bills, though, are meeting firm GOP opposition in the Senate, possibly dooming their chances of making it through the upper chamber and becoming law.\n\nOver the past several days, Breitbart News reached out to the offices of all 50 Senate Republicans to ask if the senators support consideration of these House-passed amnesty plans and found serious and growing opposition to them. To kill a bill in the Senate, with the filibuster intact as it currently is, Republicans need 41 of their 50 members to oppose the legislation. While at this time there are not 41 Republicans expressing public opposition to either plan, the growing opposition among Senate Republicans building quickly after the House passed the bills does not bode well for either plan\u2019s chances. That does not mean either idea generally speaking is dead on arrival in the Senate, either, as Senators could draft a different plan than the House-passed plan\u2013but the momentum for sweeping immigration changes is quickly hitting the brick wall of the filibuster in the Senate, dimming leftist hopes publicly touted by Senate Majority Whip Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) just this weekend that there might be enough support to move on either bill.\n\nWhile the Farmworker Amnesty would give green cards to about 2.1 million illegal aliens working on U.S. farms, theDream Act Amnesty would put potentially 4.4 million young illegal aliens on track for American citizenship.\n\nThis weekend, \u00a0Durbin told CNN he is \u201cclose\u201d to whipping enough votes to pass the H.R. 6 amnesty \u2014 the more expansive of the two bills. Senate Democrats need to peel off 10 Senate Republicans to pass the amnesties without changing the Senate rules by using the nuclear option to blow up the filibuster. Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) have repeatedly said they will not support the nuclear option, and despite a push from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Joe Biden to do so, there is no sign that a push from the left to get either to back down may work. So, Durbin is trying to corral 60 senators\u201350 Democrats plus 10 Republicans\u2013to back the legislation to get past the Senate rules.\n\n\u201cDo I have 60 now? I think I\u2019m close,\u201d Durbin said of the Dream Act Amnesty during that CNN interview. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit down with members of the Republican side and ask them if they would consider supporting it. I think I\u2019ll have some support. Whether it\u2019s enough remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nDurbin\u2019s comments, several senior GOP Senate aides told Breitbart News, may be a bluff to try to gin up extra support and momentum for the amnesties\u2013and several Senate GOP officials involved with immigration policy told Breitbart News that they do not believe that either House-passed plan will get close to 60 votes. While it is far from over, those private predictions of plugged-in Senate aides that both amnesty plans are dead on arrival in the Senate\u2013in other words, both have opposition from at least 41 senators\u2013appears to be true.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to all 50 Senate Republicans to ask if they support the H.R. 1603 Farmworker Amnesty and the H.R. 6 Dream Act Amnesty. Thus far, 15 GOP senate offices confirmed they will oppose both bills even being considered by the Senate\u2013and while that number may seem a little low, there are several offices that have not yet responded who are very likely to be opposed to both, and there is no reason to suspect that they would support either plan. Several offices would not confirm publicly where the senator stood on the issue, but privately confirmed they are opposed to both pieces of legislation as well\u2013putting the number of hard no votes against both bills north of 30 GOP senators. Assuming those aides to those senators who did not want to confirm publicly where their member stood on these bills are accurately describing these senators\u2019 positions, that means there is very little room for Durbin to maneuver to get to 60 votes on either bill.\n\nBelow, Breitbart News has compiled a dataset to show which Senate Republicans have said they will oppose the amnesty bills, which ones have not yet responded or refused to publicly confirm the senator\u2019s position, and which ones have not taken a clear position at all. We will continue to update this as senators get back to us post-publication, but all 50 Republicans have had more than two full days to answer on the legislation.\n\nSENATORS WHO STATED THEY WILL OPPOSE BOTH BILLS:\n\nSENATORS WHO DID NOT STATE A CLEAR POSITION ON THE BILLS\n\nSENATORS WHOSE OFFICES DID NOT RESPOND OR REFUSED TO PUBLICLY CONFIRM POSITION:\n\nThere are definitely some surprises in this list in many respects. First and foremost, the decision by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID) to oppose both House-passed amnesty bills is a major setback for proponents of the Farmworker Amnesty. While Crapo\u2019s position on the Dream Act Amnesty was never in doubt \u2014 he was always opposed to that \u2014 his office confirmed to Breitbart News on Tuesday he is opposed to the House-passed Farmworker Amnesty \u2014 a major setback for lobbyists trying to get that bill through the Senate as well. When the House passed that bill last week, Crapo issued a joint statement with Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) praising it and saying he would work with Bennett to introduce a Senate companion bill.\n\n\u201cWe applaud\u00a0our colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014\u00a0for their work on\u00a0this crucial legislation to make much-needed reforms\u00a0to our immigration system for our producers and farmworkers,\u201d Crapo and Bennett said in the joint statement on March 19. \u201cHouse passage of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act is an important step toward bringing certainty to our country\u2019s agriculture industry and the hard-working producers and farmworkers who have sustained the nation during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0We\u00a0will work together to\u00a0introduce companion legislation in the U.S. Senate\u00a0that appropriately addresses the needs of both the industry and the farmworkers that uphold it.\u201d\n\nBut now, as of March 23 \u2014 just a few days after that statement \u2014 Crapo is opposed to the House-passed bill.\n\n\u201cEven though Senator Crapo has said he\u2019ll work on a Senate version of the bill, we should add he won\u2019t support the existing House-passed version,\u201d Crapo\u2019s spokeswoman Lindsay Nothern told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cCrapo has said in the past that he won\u2019t support amnesty nor giving advantage or benefit toward citizenship for anyone who crosses the border illegally.\u00a0 Those entering must get to the end of the line and following the legal process by applying for a green card, permanent status, or citizenship.\u00a0The House bill is meant to be a targeted fix. Crapo supports helping Idaho farm producers with problems they have under the existing system, such as concerns over liability and the fact dairy producers need a year-round, stable workforce. In all, 34 Idaho industries support improving the workforce system.\u00a0Crapo continues to work with those business leaders on potential solutions. The present situation at the southern border has not helped the situation but negotiations will continue in the Senate. Again, Crapo cannot support the House bill as presently written.\u201d\n\nNothern added in a follow-up email that while discussions over a Senate package will \u201ccontinue\u201d in order to try to meet the needs of the agricultural community, \u201cwe are holding to core values\u201d \u2014 which of course means opposition to amnesty for illegal aliens.\n\nThis development is a serious setback for those trying to push the House Farmworker Amnesty plan in the Senate, as the original Senate GOP sponsor of the bill is now saying he opposes the House-passed bill because of the amnesty provisions contained within.\n\nMore generally, the building opposition to both amnesties was pretty clear in senators\u2019 quotes and responses. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), for instance, told Breitbart News that the Biden administration\u2019s culpability in the border crisis precludes any possibility of negotiation on immigration policy. Rubio, of course, was in 2013 a member of the so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d and helped get an amnesty passed out of the Senate. His opposition now to any such measures is a huge setback for the proponents of the various Democrat amnesty proposals.\n\n\u201cWe have a full-blown crisis at the border because the Biden Administration, and Democrats in Congress are cutting back on enforcement while they pursue various new paths to citizenship,\u201d Rubio told Breitbart News. \u201cThe only thing we should be focused on right now is stopping the humanitarian and security crisis we are confronting on our southern border.\u201d\n\nThe office of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who is leading a trip to the border with his colleagues this week, confirmed he is strongly opposed to both bills.\u00a0\u201cI can confirm that Sen. Cruz is absolutely against both bills,\u201d a Cruz spokesperson told Breitbart News. \u201cSen. Cruz is leading his colleagues in a tour of the border this week to witness the crisis President Biden and the Democrats\u2019 radical agenda has created firsthand. Sen. Cruz will continue working with his colleagues to bolster border security, enforce the rule of law, and protect law-abiding Americans.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) called on President Biden to reverse his undoing of former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration actions. \u201cWe need to secure the southern border first and get this crisis caused by Biden under control before considering any immigration reforms,\u201d the Daines spokesperson said. \u201cA starting point would be to reinstate the policies from the Trump administration that Biden reversed on Day One.\u201d\n\nSen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) believes similarly and is concerned that these Democrat proposals are creating an incentive to prospective illegal aliens flooding the border. \u201cSenator Hagerty is strongly opposed to amnesty, and it is astonishing that Democrats are proposing an amnesty plan at a time when the Biden Administration\u2019s unilateral dismantling of American border security measures has created a border crisis in which there are currently record numbers of unaccompanied migrant minors in custody,\u201d a Hagerty spokesperson told Breitbart News. \u201cSecretary Mayorkas acknowledged last week that the government cannot currently process within legal time limits the record number of minors currently in custody, and simultaneously enacting a blanket amnesty proposal would only encourage more illegal immigration and exacerbate this humanitarian crisis, which the White House still refuses to acknowledge. The Senator believes that securing our border and protecting American workers struggling to find jobs in light of the pandemic-induced recession must be the priority, not importing foreign labor to compete with them.\u201d\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-OK) is strongly opposed as well. \u201cSen. Inhofe has always been consistent in that he will not support immigration proposals that grant amnesty to those here illegally \u2013 allowing them to jump the line ahead of immigrants going through the process lawfully,\u201d Inhofe\u2019s spokesperson told Breitbart News, adding that he is a \u201cno on any bill that grants amnesty!\u201d\n\nSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) lamented the lack of any serious bipartisanship in addressing these problems. \u201cSenator Hyde-Smith does not support the partisan immigration bills generated in the House,\u201d a spokesperson for the Mississippi Republican told Breitbart News. \u201cThe Senator, who has consistently opposed rewarding those who have entered our country illegally, believes the country would be better served with a comprehensive and bipartisan approach to secure our borders and fix the broken American immigration system.\u201d\n\nDespite the growing opposition to amnesty measures among Republican Senators, one surprise in a different direction is the position of Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL). A spokesperson for Scott, who as Breitbart News has reported is developing his own Dream Act-style amnesty bill despite his office\u2019s insistence that he opposes amnesty, would not say he is opposed to or supportive of the two bills that passed the House last week. When asked about them, Scott\u2019s office issued a generic statement reiterating the senator opposes amnesty without specifically saying where he is on these two particular bills.\n\n\u201cSenator Scott does not support amnesty,\u201d Scott\u2019s office told Breitbart News. \u201cLook at what Biden\u2019s open borders and amnesty plan is doing to our Southern border. Senator Scott has long said reforms to the immigration system become much more simple once the border is secure, and that\u2019s his focus.\u201d\n\nAsked again in a follow-up email if that means the senator is specifically opposed to the two bills in question that passed the House last week\u2013the Farmworker Amnesty plan and the Dream Act Amnesty plan\u2013his office issued another vague and general condemnation of amnesty. \u201cSenator Scott does not support amnesty,\u201d Scott\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nIn the did not answer or refused to publicly state a position column, too, there are also some surprises. Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), John Kennedy (R-LA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Jim Risch (R-ID), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Todd Young (R-IN), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and John Barrasso (R-WY) are all probably hard against both bills based off their previous voting history and other public statements, but their offices did not reply or would not publicly confirm their positions. Assuming they all are, that would put the total of confirmed opposition over 30\u2013and in stone\u2019s throw range of reaching a filibuster of 41.\n\nBreitbart News will continue to update this story and report in new stories as more senators answer these basic questions, but one thing is very clear:\u00a0Republican voters and conservatives are overwhelmingly opposed to both of these amnesty bills.\n\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports survey of about 1,000 likely U.S. voters found that Republicans opposed the amnesty bills by 72 percent. Conservatives, likewise, oppose the amnesty bills by a 77 percent majority, and swing voters oppose the bills by a 55 percent majority.\n\nThe H.R. 1603 Farmworker Amnesty and the H.R. 6 Dream Act Amnesty have each been backed by some of the nation\u2019s most powerful political donors in the Washington, DC beltway. The H.R. 6 amnesty, for instance, has support from tech conglomerates like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Facebook, as well as multinational corporations like Verizon, Visa, Marriott International, and Apple.\n\nMeanwhile, big agriculture interests are lobbying for lawmakers to pass the Farmworker Amnesty as the legislation, aside from legalizing an illegal workforce, would allow farms to import more foreign visa workers each year and is explicitly designed to keep U.S. wages from rising.\n\nThe authors of the Farmworker Amnesty say the legislation is necessary to \u201cstabilize wage rates\u201d by capping the rate to which wages can grow in the future.\u00a0The\u00a0National Council for Farmer Cooperatives and the\u00a0National Milk Producers Federation are both backing the amnesty.\n\n\u201cWithout reform, the minimum wage rates will continue to skyrocket\u2026\u201d the authors of the amnesty admit in their summary of the legislation.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is lobbying on behalf of bost amnesties \u2014 calling their passage \u201ccritically important\u201d in a statement. The Chamber represents the interests of big businesses who see mass immigration as a boon to their profit margins as they can cut the cost of labor by artificially inflating the labor market.\n\nResearch by the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 Steven Camarota reveals that for every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of an American workers\u2019 occupation, Americans\u2019 weekly wages are cut by perhaps 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by potentially 8.75 percent, as more than 17 percent of the\u00a0workforce\u00a0is foreign-born.\n\nAlready, current immigration levels\u00a0put downward pressure on U.S. wages while\u00a0redistributing\u00a0about\u00a0$500 billion in wealth\u00a0away from America\u2019s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.\n\nPeer-reviewed\u00a0research\u00a0by economist Christoph Albert acknowledges that \u201cas immigrants accept lower wages, they are preferably chosen by firms and therefore have higher job-finding rates than natives, consistent with evidence found in U.S. data.\u201d Albert\u2019s research also finds that immigration \u201craises competition\u201d for native-born Americans in the labor market.\n\nIndependent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has repeatedly noted how amnesty, and high immigration levels, depletes U.S. wages.\n\nIn 2013, CBO\u00a0analysis stated\u00a0that the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty plan would \u201cslightly\u201d push down wages for the American workers. A 2020 CBO\u00a0analysis stated\u00a0that \u201cimmigration has exerted downward pressure on the wages of relatively low-skilled workers who are already in the country, regardless of their birthplace.\u201d\n\nToday, there are anywhere between 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S.",

    "body": "studies professor at Emory University of California's Reparations Task Force decision on who gets reparations among Black California residents.  \u201cBlack is a self-selecting category on the census, anyone can select Black,\u201d said Kamilah Moore, Chair of the California Reparations Task Force. Moore voted in favor of a lineage-based standard or the equivalent of to the one-drop rule, for Black California residents with family lineage tracing back to an enslaved descendant in the 19 th century, but the implications of reparations are being felt far beyond the Golden State.  \u201cIt's important because whatever California does with its prestige in this country is going to affect how other states act,\u201d said Joyce Hope Scott, professor of African-American studies at Boston University.  Hope Scott has dedicated her entire career to the study and advocacy of reparations, she says one thing is for certain when it comes to what is and isn't reparations.  \u201cI will say, flat-out, straight-out, a check, a one-time payment is not doing it,\u201d Hope Scott said.  Hope Scott says the harms associated with slavery are so deeply rooted, a simple paycheck won't be enough to repair the harms felt by generations of African-Americans who are still suffering from systemic racism today.  \u201cIt's about the fact you have a group of people who not only suffered slavery but landlessness, not just because they weren't given any by compensation but by terrorist acts that were never litigated,\u201d Hope Scott said.  Hope Scott believes real forms of reparations include more tangible efforts that impacts property and wealth building. \u201cThe bane of wealth disparity between Blacks and whites because they started out with no land.  Not only did they not start out with no land or homes, the land and nearly 16 million acres they did acquire over the course of time after slavery was taken away from them by scurrilous means by governmental acts and so on and so forth,\u201d Hope Scott said.  Story continues  Similar to Hope Scott feels a simple paycheck isn't enough, Dianne Stewart, Ph.D., an African-American studies professor at Emory University believes social programs aren't the answer either.  \u201cReparations first of all is not affirmative action. Reparations is a form of compensation that is supposed to repair damage,\u201d said Stewart.  Stewart says reparations can come in different forms such as corporate reparations. \u201cPursuing corporate reparations is critical and I think that's a very important aspect of any reparations plan and that can be done,\u201d Stewart said.  Stewart outlines her own list of what real reparations could look like.  \u201cFree genetic testing and genealogy services, African-Americans should have free healthcare period, third, education, there should be support for HBCUs and other kinds of institutions that are African centered. Wealth building, things like Derrick Hamilton's baby bonds should absolutely be supported. I think corporations should be held liable where corporations can be found that participated in slavery and held people as slaves, slavery was a business. Mental health care as well, really work with experts to develop resources that can promote family building,\u201d said Stewart of her vision of reparations for African-Americans.  The Associated Press reports cities in Michigan, Rhode Island, and Illinois are considering or have already passed some form of reparations measures. At the federal level, H.R. 40, legislation that would establish a committee to study reparations, was first introduced in 1989 by the late Rep. John Conyers and introduced again by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee last year, but the bill has since stalled.  Both Stewart and Hope Scott believe what's happening in California can help fuel the reparations debate nationally.  \u201cWe really don't think of California as a slave state, so what of the places we identify with slavery are going to do. It's almost embarrassing, look at California doing this and you've got Mississippi, Georgia who can't do anything, are you kidding me?\u201d Stewart said of Southern states more associated with slavery not leading the way on reparations for African-Americans.  Hope Scott points to financial and education institutions as having to do their part in repairing harms done to African-Americans over several generations.  \u201cNow you've got banks who need to weigh in on this, you've got universities who've got to weigh in, you've got insurance companies who've got to weigh in, everybody should weigh in however they want to do it. The banks are not going to be in there with H.R. 40 people, the insurance companies aren't going to be sitting in the city council chambers in California, so let them do what they have to do at that level,\u201d Hope Scott said.  Hope Scott says even if states take the lead on reparations or if the federal government takes the lead, it will still be a win for Black people. \u201cI don't think the state can do too much or the federal level can do too much, I don't think they can cancel each other out,\u201d Hope Scott said.  As the California Reparations Task Force continues to work out granular details on their reparations plan, both Stewart and Hope Scott feels real tangible reparations cannot come soon enough. \u201cEven if everyone stopped being racist after slavery, that damage would still reverberate, not only in wealthlessness but in other areas as well for example, chronic diseases African-Americans suffer from,\u201d Stewart said.",

    "body": "ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) today lauded the Biden Administration for initiating action to rein in direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees and pledged continued vigilance to optimize the regulatory proposal for the benefit of seniors and for the viability of the pharmacies that serve them.  \"DIR fees have needlessly inflated seniors' out-of-pocket drug costs and have been a bane of pharmacies' existence \u2013 and a threat to their existence \u2013 for more than a decade. NACDS welcomes the Biden Administration's action, which is critical for retail pharmacies of all formats and sizes,\" said NACDS President and CEO Steven C. Anderson.  \"We will continue to engage and we will comment formally to help make the most of this moment. We also look forward to working with the administration, with Congress and with other key stakeholders for the establishment of consistent, relevant and workable pharmacy quality measures that are essential to the success of true DIR fee reform.\"  The Biden Administration's action came in the form of a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed rule for Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs. Released on January 6, 2022, the proposed rule is scheduled to be published on January 12, 2022, in the Federal Register.  The proposed rule would have the practical effect of preventing the needless inflation of seniors' out-of-pocket drug costs that results from a current regulatory loophole. This same loophole jeopardizes pharmacy viability with unpredictable and often below-cost payments from payers to pharmacies for the medications that they dispense.  \"NACDS expresses deep appreciation to the sponsors of the Pharmacy DIR Reform to Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act ( S. 1909 H.R. 3554 ) in this Congress \u2013 and to those who have helped lead the charge for DIR fee reform in prior Congresses,\" Anderson said. \"We look forward to their continued leadership and engagement throughout the regulatory process and to address any and all remaining legislative needs.\"  Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) introduced the bill in the Senate; while Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT), Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA), Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), Rep. John Rose (R-TN), Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), and Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) introduced a similar bill in the House. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) has championed DIR fee reform in his leadership capacity, as has former Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA).  The reforms proposed by CMS are estimated to reduce seniors' costs by $21.3 billion over 10 years. CMS states pharmacy DIR fees grew more than 107,400 percent between 2010 and 2020.  The Administration also issued a press release and fact sheet about the proposal, which would take effect on January 1, 2023.

    "body": "In a CNN town hall Tuesday, Biden stumbled through a recounting of his two-hour Feb. 10 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which the two leaders discussed the issue of China\u2019s human rights violations against Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Biden said that, historically, China has been victimized by foreign powers when it is not unified and explained that this is Xi\u2019s rationale for exerting tight control over his people.\n\n\u201cCulturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow,\u201d Biden said, a line that was quickly criticized by several GOP lawmakers and pundits. He also said that the United States will reassert its role as a champion of human rights and that China will face consequences for the atrocities, but those lines got less coverage and attention.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s much more complicated,\u201d Biden said in the town hall. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t try to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television.\u201d\n\nIf only Biden had taken his own advice. On Thursday, McMaster criticized Biden\u2019s comments on the Uighurs while virtually addressing a meeting of the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 150 conservative GOP lawmakers led by Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.). A few reporters were invited to join the virtual meeting. McMaster\u2019s comments were on the record.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden on the town hall, I mean he made a big mistake,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Well, they have different cultural norms.\u2019 You could call that bigotry masquerading as cultural sensitivity.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s State Department declared on its very last full day that the Chinese government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang through a mix of mass internment, mass forced labor, forced sterilization and other measures to intentionally extinguish their culture and identity from the face of the earth.\n\nBiden\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, testified during his January Senate confirmation hearing that he agrees Beijing\u2019s atrocities amount to a genocide, but the Biden administration has not made this official determination yet, pending an internal review. During the campaign, the Biden team debated and decided to call the atrocities a genocide even before the Trump administration made that determination.\n\nIn his RSC event, McMaster said the United States had for decades engaged in \u201cstrategic narcissism\u201d toward China, adding that U.S. leaders in government and business had been compromised and tricked into helping the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s strategy out of greed or ignorance.\n\n\u201cThey have these useful idiots here in the United States \u2026 who just parrot their perspective, that \u2018poor China,\u2019 that we are trying to keep China down,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cNo, we are defending ourselves from Chinese Communist Party aggression.\u201d\n\nMcMaster was there to promote his book, \u201cBattlegrounds: The Fight to Defend the Free World,\u201d which came out last fall. Referring to its thesis, he said the United States was wrong to assume after the end of the Cold War that the era of great-power competition was over and that China would liberalize both economically and politically as it rose.\n\n\u201cThis was obviously not the case much earlier than 2017, but we clung to that assumption,\u201d McMaster said, praising the Trump administration\u2019s turn toward a more competitive China approach. \u201cI think the greatest threat that we are encountering to our future is from the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nXi is driven by \u201cfear of losing control\u201d and an ambition to promote China\u2019s authoritarian, mercantilist model at the expense of the free world, McMaster said. Beijing\u2019s strategy uses a mix of co-optation, coercion and concealment to get Western nations and leaders to support the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s goals or at least stop criticizing them. He labeled the Chinese state-driven industrial model a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d\n\nMcMaster called for a whole-of-society approach to win the grand strategic competition. He cautioned the Biden team not to fall into the trap of making unenforceable deals with Beijing in exchange for the false promise of smooth relations. He said that after the 2022 Winter Olympics, Xi will lose any remaining restraint and China\u2019s behavior will only get worse.\n\nIn a conference call Thursday evening to preview Biden\u2019s participation in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven on Friday, a senior administration official sought to clarify the confusion about Biden\u2019s call with Xi, saying Biden emphasized his long-held commitment to universal values, human rights and the dignity of all people.\n\n\u201c[Biden] was quite direct and candid in speaking with the president of China on the subject of Xinjiang,\u201d the official said.",

Spicer, who also questioned the decision in a tweet, had been appointed to the Naval Academy visitors' board.Psaki said the move was \"to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values.\"She added, \"I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified or not political to serve on these boards. But the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration. They are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you're aligned with the values of this administration.\"Other top officials whose resignations were requested include former Trump national security adviser H.R.

Vought in a tweet said that he will not step down. \"No. It\u2019s a three year term,\" he tweeted with an image of the request from the White House.USA TODAY",

    "body": "Due to WFH challenges amid the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly 30% of companies adjusted performance evaluations and 5% paused reviews or completely canceled them, according to a survey from McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org . As a simplification expert with several anti-complexity books and TED talks , I strongly believe that the percentage of companies eliminating evals should be 100%. Why? Because the annual process for reviewing employees' performances has become so bloated that it's now referred to as \u201creview season.\u201d What began last century as a simple rating system has devolved into a measurement of everything from \u201cmet sales goals\u201d and \u201cachieved client success\u201d to \u201ctakes initiative\u201d and \u201ccollaborates well with others.\u201d For managers, all these criteria represent multiple data points to plot, more fields to populate and endless forms to complete and submit to H.R. Meanwhile, the average employee is bewildered about how to apply the evaluation to her day-to-day. Does she need to be more of a team player\u2026or take ownership of projects more often? Should she follow direction better\u2026or take more initiative? These inputs often contradict one another, leaving the employee confused and even traumatized. For a kinder, gentler and less complicated approach, check out the five alternatives below. Modify the cadence of performance goals. For most companies, goals set in January are obsolete by end of year. Quarterly goals are far more practical \u2014 and quarterly reviews are a more accurate reflection of the employee's overall performance. \u201cCompanies that set performance goals quarterly generate 31% greater returns from their performance process than those who do it annually, said Josh Bersin, H.R. researcher and expert. \u201cAnd those who do it monthly get even better results.\u201d Speaking of monthly check-ins. Rather than withhold feedback until the annual review season, managers at professional services company Accenture feedback employees all year long. Likewise, managers and employees at The Gap, Inc., are encouraged to have 12 informal, undocumented conversations about performance during the fiscal year. By coaching people in real-time \u2014 instead of bringing up mistakes or successes from months ago \u2014 these touchpoints enable managers to resolve performance issues more efficiently (and less stressfully) than in a formal review. Conduct real-time retrospectives. Global leader Deloitte replaced its review process with \u201cperformance snapshots,\u201d which evaluate an employee at a single moment in time rather than over an entire year. Typically done after a project is completed, snapshots enable managers to dialogue with employees about their performance while the project is still top of mind. In this context, performance recognition can be given; challenges or obstacles can be identified; and if needed, upskilling can be scheduled. Manage it through an app. In 2016, General Electric cancelled annual talent reviews for its employees, replacing those evals with touchpoint discussions between managers and employees about goal progress. Rather than relying on performance scores or rankings, it rolled out PD@GE , a smartphone app designed to compel more frequent and deeper conversations between managers and employees. The app enables a constant exchange of year-round feedback; and participants can receive suggestions from anyone in their network, including upper management and employees on other teams. Provide mandatory compensation training for managers. Plenty of naysayers have asked me how pay raises can be awarded if ratings aren't compiled? I point them to Adobe, which has used a management development program since 2012 to address this. Managers are given access to an internal salary tool illustrating where each employee falls in the salary range for his or her role. From a set pool of money, managers are empowered to give pay increases, keeping the following criteria in mind: \u00b7 How is the employee performing relative to established objectives? \u00b7 Is this employee competitively paid? \u00b7 What kind of impact are they making and how critical is the role they are playing in the business? \u00b7 Does this employee have unique skills that are difficult to find in the market? Giving feedback regularly to your direct reports sends the message that you're invested in their success at the company. Whenever possible, connect your feedback to organizational strategy or leadership values so people can see how their individual performance aligns with the business holistically. When employees have a clear understanding of what they need to improve or change in order to be promoted, they're more likely to stay with their current employer. Whether you're ready to update your review process or not, the shift is already underway. Organizations using ranking systems and nonstop forms will fall behind those opting for simpler and more humane approaches to talent management.

Dec. 16, 2022\n  NACDS announced that a new poll conducted by Morning Consult December 7-12 found that 64 percent of American adults \u2013 including majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \u2013 believe \"Learning the lessons of the pandemic means keeping in place policies that make it easier for patients to access services from pharmacists and other pharmacy team members \u2013 including vaccinations.\"\n  Meanwhile, only 20 percent believe: \"It is time to return to all policies that were in place before the pandemic, including those that limit patients' access to services provided by pharmacists and other pharmacy team members.\"\n  Consistent with the new poll and with the impending end to pandemic policies, NACDS conveyed again to the Biden Administration and to Congress the increasing urgency of preventing forced reductions in patients' access to pharmacy services that now are widely expected.\n  \"If this capacity goes away, Americans' vaccination experience will be characterized by lack of access, especially for children and families, longer wait times and frustration,\" wrote NACDS President and CEO Steven C. Anderson to Biden Administration officials and to members of Congress. \"The current 'triple-demic' of COVID-19, flu, and RSV demonstrates that our nation will continue to experience spikes in vaccination demand.\"\n  NACDS is urging the Biden Administration to ensure pharmacy authorities related to vaccination, testing, and treatment do not end with the public health emergency or with the transition of COVID-19 countermeasures to commercial markets. NACDS also continues urgent calls for the U.S. Congress to pass the Equitable Community Access to Pharmacist Services Act (H.R. 7213).",

    "body": "Former national security adviser reacts to the chaos unfolding in Kabul on 'The Story'\n\n\n\n\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  \n\nEditor's note: This essay is adapted from the author's congressional testimony on October 5.\u00a0\nThe catastrophe that is only beginning in Afghanistan, is the result of incompetence based in strategic narcissism, or the tendency for American leaders to define the world only in relation to the United States, and to assume that what they decide to do is decisive in securing a positive outcome.\u00a0\nBut others, including adversaries and enemies, also enjoy authorship over the future. In Afghanistan, policies and strategies across two decades were based on what U.S. leaders preferred rather than what the situation demanded. Strategic narcissism led to self-delusion, and self-delusion provided a rationale for self-defeat.\nA fundamental lesson of Afghanistan is that wars are interactive and that progress in war and diplomacy is never linear. That is why the war in Afghanistan and the broader war against jihadist terrorist organizations is not over; it is entering a new, more dangerous era. Containing the catastrophe in Afghanistan and learning from it will require U.S. leaders to confront the truth of our experience in Afghanistan and stop pretending.\u00a0\nStop pretending that our surrender to the Taliban in February 2020 and subsequent concessions to that terrorist organization\u2014which strengthened our enemies and weakened our Afghan allies\u2014were not the principal reasons for a lost war and its consequences.\u00a0\nMICHAEL GOODWIN: EVERYTHING WE FEARED ABOUT BIDEN'S STAGGERING AFGHANISTAN DEBACLE IS TRUE\nThe psychological blows we delivered to our Afghan allies included negotiating with the Taliban without the Afghan government, not insisting on a cease fire, forcing the Afghan government to release 5,000 terrorists, curtailing intelligence support, ending active pursuit of the Taliban, withdrawing all aircraft from the country, and terminating contractor support for Afghan forces.\u00a0\nStop pretending that we can end so-called endless wars by withdrawal. Wars do not end when one party disengages and our enemies are waging an endless jihad. We failed to learn from our complete withdrawal from Iraq in December 2011 and the subsequent reemergence of al Qaeda in Iraq which morphed into ISIS. By the summer of 2014, ISIS gained control of territory the size of Britain and became the most destructive terrorist organization in history. As the English philosopher and theologian \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adG.K. Chesterton observed, war may not be the best way of settling differences, but it may be the only way to ensure that they are not settled for you.\nStop pretending that all our efforts in Afghanistan were wasted. Progress is impossible to disavow as we watch the Taliban reverse gains and reinstate the horrors endured during the organization\u2019s rule from 1996 to 2001. Afghanistan was not transformed into Denmark. But Afghanistan only needed to be Afghanistan with a government hostile to jihadist terrorists and security forces strong enough to withstand the regenerative capacity of the Taliban.\nStop pretending that the outcome would have been better if we had simply left Afghanistan after the successful military campaign in 2001. The consolidation of gains has never been an optional phase in war. The notion that the Taliban would have accepted a negotiated agreement consistent with our objectives in Afghanistan earlier in the war is just another element of our self-delusion.\nStop pretending that America cannot generate the will for sustained military efforts abroad. Sustained efforts in Korea, the Sinai, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Colombia are just a few examples of successful and sustained long term efforts. Those who cite public opinion polls that favor withdrawal should attribute lack of support to leaders\u2019 failure to explain what was at stake in the war and the strategy for achieving an outcome worthy of the costs, risks, and sacrifices. By 2018 low levels of multi-national military and financial support were enabling Afghans to bear the brunt of the fight.\nThe catastrophe that is only beginning in Afghanistan is the result of incompetence\n Stop pretending that there are short term solutions to long term problems. Afghanistan was not a twenty-year war; it was a one-year war fought twenty times over. Our short-term approach increased the cost and duration of the war. Declarations of withdrawal across three administrations emboldened our enemies, sowed doubts among our allies, encouraged hedging behavior, perpetuated corruption, and weakened state institutions.\nStop pretending that adversaries will conform to our preferences or that we can fight enemies we wish we had rather than our actual enemies. Until the base motivation of its Army changes, Pakistan will not be a partner against terrorist organizations. The Taliban has not changed, is intertwined with other jihadist terrorists, and is determined to reinstate brutal Sharia.\u00a0\nThe reestablishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is as much a victory for al Qaeda and other jihadists as it is for the Taliban. The notion of partnering with the Taliban to fight terrorism is like partnering with Whitey Bulger or Tony Soprano to fight organized crime.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nStop pretending that vilification from the \u2018international community\u2019 will influence the Taliban. The notion that enemies of humanity who are determined to force Afghanistan back into the 7th century or an organization led by Hibatullah Akhundzada, who encouraged his seventeen-year-old son to commit murder as a suicide bomber at age 17, are concerned about chiding tweets or disapproving speeches is ludicrous.\nStop pretending that the military instrument can be separated from diplomacy. As Secretary George Shultz observed, \"negotiation is a euphemism for capitulation unless the shadow of power is cast across the bargaining table.\" Civilian and military leaders said that there was no military solution to the war in Afghanistan. But the Taliban, their Pakistani sponsors, and their al Qaeda allies clearly came up with one. \u00a0More diplomacy with the Taliban without the prospect of force will achieve nothing but further embarrassment.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFinally, we must stop pretending that it is acceptable to fight wars without a commitment to win. Winning in Afghanistan meant achieving the just intention of ensuring that Afghanistan never again became a haven for jihadist terrorists. Because in war each side tries to outdo the other, lack of commitment to win is counterproductive. According to Thomas Aquinas' jus ad bellum theory, it is also unethical to fight without determination to succeed. Our leaders invented new terms like \u2018responsible end\u2019 as cover for their ambivalence as they sent soldiers into battle.\u00a0\nUnless we stop pretending and demand better from our leaders, the prospect of learning from our searing experience in South Asia, rebuilding our strategic competence, and effacing the stain of 2021 will remain dim.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM H.R.

At the signing ceremony in Qatar, Pompeo posed for photographs alongside Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar, who is anticipated to head the next Taliban government in Afghanistan.\u00a0\nAt the time, critics blasted the Trump administration for excluding the Afghan government, claiming it undercut its legitimacy. That criticism has been renewed amid the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan and the collapse of the US-backed Afghan government on August 15.\n\n                          \n                          Bolton, who served as Trump's national security advisor from 2018 to 2019, has said both the Trump administration and President Joe Biden are responsible for the chaotic and ongoing removal of US troops from the country.\nOther Republicans who have criticized Trump and Biden over the pullout include Reps.

Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, have led the latest efforts to get the legislation passed. They have teamed up with Republicans, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get the legislation passed in a closely divided Congress.\nThe House Rules Committee met to consider the bill on Tuesday, a likely step before a full House floor vote.

The bill would outlaw the type of cub petting business that was highlighted during portions of Netflix's hit \"Tiger King,\" which focused on the battle between exotic zoo operators like Joe Exotic Bhagavan Mahamayavi \"Doc\" Antle and organizations like Baskin's Big Cat Rescue. Cub petting is when zoos allow people to pay for up-close encounters with tiger and similar exotic cubs, a practice strongly opposed by animal welfare advocates.\nAntle was charged earlier this summer with federal money laundering earlier this summer. Prosecutors claimed that he laundered more than $500,00o, the apparent proceeds of a human smuggling operation, the Associated Press previously reported. Antle operates a wildlife safari near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\nExotic and his supporters failed to get then-President Donald Trump to pardon him.",

    "body": "Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) on Thursday wrecked President Biden\u2019s hopes of destroying federal election integrity laws, causing Democrats to panic heading into the 2022 midterms.\n\nWhile Biden on Wednesday was forced to\u00a0shelve his massive tax and spend package until next year because of Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s (D-WV) opposition, Biden immediately pivoted to enact his second priority of altering election integrity laws, such as doing away with popular voter ID constraints.\n\n\u201cIf we can get the congressional voting rights done, we should do it. \u2026 There\u2019s nothing domestically more important than voting rights,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut Sinema singlehandedly burst Biden\u2019s desperate attempt to weaken election integrity laws Wednesday evening by stating she will protect the 60-vote filibuster threshold. Fifty Senate votes are needed to trash the filibuster. If the filibuster is terminated, a simple majority vote could be held to destroy election laws.\n\nTo lure\u00a0Sinema into destroying election laws, Democrats have watered down their original H.R.1 proposal. Yet\u00a0Sinema\u2019s spokesman\u00a0John LaBombard\u00a0told Politico\u00a0she will protect the filibuster\u2019s bipartisan standard and ultimately election integrity.\n\n\u201cShe continues to support the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, to protect the country from repeated radical reversals in federal policy which would cement uncertainty, deepen divisions, and further erode Americans\u2019 confidence in our government,\u201d LaBombard said.\n\nSinema\u2019s spokesman also implied that Sinema may be interested in the watered down \u201cvoting rights\u201d proposal if it garnered bipartisan support above the\u00a0filibuster\u2019s threshold.\n\n\u201cSenator Sinema has asked those who want to weaken or eliminate the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation which she supports if it would be good for our country to do so,\u201d LaBombard said.\n\nSinema\u2019s position has caused congressional Democrats concern that 2020\u2019s pandemic-centric election laws will not be applied in 2022, such as voting by mail and other weakened measures. Temporary 2020 elections laws reverting back to pre-pandemic rules likely reduce the Democrats\u2019 ability to win elections.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to become too dramatic,\u201d Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) told Politico\u00a0on Thursday, \u201cbut voting rights may be the only thing we have to at least halt the trek away from democracy.\u201d\n\nRep. James Clyburn (D-SC) also voiced concerns\u00a0that if election integrity laws are reinstated before the 2022 midterms, America\u2019s democratic republic will no longer exist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be constrained by trying to do it before the end of the year. I don\u2019t know that you have to do it before the end of the year,\u201d Clyburn told Politico. \u201cI just want us to get a bill done that will help preserve this democracy because if we don\u2019t, I think we\u2019ve lost this democracy.\u201d\n\nRep. Anthony Brown (D-MD) echoed Clyburn\u2019s urgency. \u201cI want to see Biden start running people in and out of the White House,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI want to start by seeing the president using the full leverage of his office. It\u2019s a crisis in democracy and the president needs to address it.\u201d\n\nMSNBC anchor Al Sharpton warned that if election integrity is not weakened, the Democrat base voters will not vote for Democrats.\n\n\u201cAn inaction at this point would lead to an inaction of Black voters. People are saying, \u2018If they don\u2019t do this, I\u2019m not voting,\u2019\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cPeople are saying they feel betrayed.\u201d",

We are grateful to our champions Congressmen Quigley and Fortenberry and leaders throughout the House for making today's passage a reality.\n\nWith more than 330 House and 50 Senate cosponsors, this critical bill has more cosponsors than any bill introduced in Congress this year. Today's vote brings this legislation one step closer to making a meaningful difference in the lives of those living with ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nACT for ALS\u00a0creates a new grant program that funds access to investigational ALS treatments for people living with ALS who cannot participate in clinical trials, while also supporting research on treatment safety and ALS progression.\n\nThe legislation invests in neurodegenerative disease research through a brand-new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program. This program is critically important to keeping FDA and other federal agencies moving urgently to find treatments and cures that can be approved by the FDA, covered by health insurance and made available to all.\n\nFinally, the ACT for ALS would establish a Health and Human Services (HHS) Public-Private Partnership for Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases jointly led by the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the first federal entity explicitly charged with the responsibility to speed the development and approval of therapies for rare neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n'Today, we celebrate the fierce community of advocates who were relentless in making ACT for ALS the most cosponsored bill in this Congress,' I AM ALS Director of Science and Policy Dr. Megan Miller said. 'Today's overwhelming support and passage in the House of Representatives is a direct result of the advocates' unwavering determination to improve the lives of people living with ALS today and in the future. I AM ALS stands united with them in calling for immediate action in the Senate. It is time we act with the urgency this disease requires.'\n\nThe ALS Association Chief Mission Officer Dr. Neil Thakur said, 'We have worked closely with Congress and advocates on this measure to provide funding for early access to ALS investigational therapies as well as new funds to FDA for ALS research to develop cures and treatments. People with ALS can't wait, and passage of this bill is urgently needed.'\n\n'Today's overwhelmingly bipartisan House passage of the ACT for ALS further emphasizes the importance of enacting this legislation as soon as possible. Now it is time for the Senate to act. The Muscular Dystrophy Association stands behind this legislation and is eager to work with the bill sponsors and Senate leaders to make this a reality,' said Paul Melmeyer, Vice President, Public Policy and Advocacy, Muscular Dystrophy Association.\"\n\nIs there a problem with this press release?

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he opposed Congress alone creating the new state and he believes, like Republicans have argued, that statehood for the nation's capital needs to be done through a constitutional amendment.\u00a0\n\"If Congress wants to make D.C. a state, it should propose a constitutional amendment,\" Manchin said in an interview with the West Virginia MetroNews radio network, according to The Associated Press. \"It should propose a constitutional amendment and let the people of America vote.\"\nHOUSE PASSES DC STATEHOOD BILL TO MAKE DISTRICT 51ST STATE AFTER HEATED FLOOR DEBATE\nIn a 50-50 split Senate, D.C. statehood already had a tough shot of becoming a reality because as long as the legislative filibuster is in place the proposal would require 60 votes to advance. Republicans have been squarely opposed to elevating the\u00a0federal district to statehood\u00a0status arguing it's an unconstitutional powerplay by Democrats to add two more liberal senators to the upper chamber.\u00a0\n\n      Sen.

    "body": "In May this year, 240,000 illegal aliens were apprehended by Border Patrol, an all-time high for the country. That\u2019s nearly 8,000 every day \u2013 not including the thousands of aliens who got away. The crisis at the border is the number one long-term problem our country is facing. Under President Biden, the Left has systematically dismantled every system and tool we have to stop the flow of illegal aliens across our border. Worse, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has disempowered our law enforcement, causing deep division and deeper loss. That\u2019s why House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., must make border security the No. 1 priority for Congress next year when conservatives retake the House. Americans are demanding a total overhaul of border security and a return to law and order. Americans have noticed, and are demanding change. Heritage Action surveyed Americans in congressional battleground districts in May 2022 and found that 72% of respondents wanted stricter enforcement of immigration laws \u2013 only 12% thought they should be looser. Nearly two-thirds also blamed Biden\u2019s executive orders for the crisis, and supported hiring more border patrol and ending catch-and-release. DESANTIS WAS RIGHT TO SEND MIGRANTS TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD. WE NEED TO BRNG BORDER CRISIS TO DEMOCRATS If Republicans take the House in November, it\u2019s clear that conservatives will have a mandate from the American people to reverse Biden\u2019s wave of disastrous executive orders and fix the border. The only question is what they will do with that mandate. They could return to the pre-Trump era of \"compromise,\" granting amnesty without meaningfully securing the border. Or they could follow the will of the people, hold Biden accountable, and make a powerful border security package H.R. 1, the first bill that the next Congress takes up. The next speaker of the House will have his work cut out for him, but he does not have to go it alone. Conservatives have already begun to lay the groundwork for the policies a strong border bill should include. Earlier this year, a coalition of former senior law enforcement officials and leading conservative groups, including Heritage Action, laid out a list of policies that Republican leadership must include in a border bill when they retake the House next year. The biggest opportunity for reform is the broken asylum system. Asylum is supposed to only go to those fleeing persecution in their home country, yet has increasingly been abused. Now, many aliens traveling for economic reasons simply claim they\u2019re afraid to return to their home country and are allowed into the United States, only to never show up for a court hearing. The number of asylum applications has exploded in recent years, up from 25,000 in 2005 to\u00a0over 200,000 before 2020. There are several asylum loopholes Congress must close: First of all, it\u2019s time to use common sense and stop allowing entry to illegal border-crossers \u2013 aka \"catch and release.\" It is outrageous that Border Patrol catches aliens in the middle of trespassing and then must admit them to the country for asylum hearings. Congress must authorize Homeland Security to immediately expel illegal aliens caught along the border. Second, Congress must immediately reimplement the Remain in Mexico policy and designate Mexico a safe third country, meaning aliens crossing through Mexico cannot claim asylum in the U.S. An alien claiming they are fleeing violence in Honduras should simply stay in Mexico or other safe third countries, instead of being admitted into the United States. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Third, Congress should ensure all parts of law enforcement are doing their jobs. They should end the outrageous abuse of the parole authority, which allows USCIS to simply let aliens go free inside the U.S. as they wait for deportation hearings (most never show up, of course). Congress should simultaneously increase the resources of CBP and other agencies while limiting the prosecutorial discretion that allows liberal Soros-funded prosecutors to simply refuse to charge illegal aliens. Finally, Mayorkas must be impeached. He has failed the basic requirements of the job, making a mockery of our nation\u2019s laws. A Republican House should immediately impeach the secretary, showing the Biden administration that there are consequences for undermining our national security. There is far more Congress can do, and there is much they shouldn\u2019t do \u2013 for one, amnesty is an immediate non-starter. Our leaders should be confident that prioritizing border security will be politically rewarding: a July Morning Consult poll\u00a0shows that Republicans hold a 12-point edge in trust among independent voters on their handling of immigration. Additionally, 61% of independents said passing an immigration reform bill should be a \"top\" or \"important\" priority for Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The American people know the border is in chaos. They know it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. They support border security. The only thing they don\u2019t know is whether Congress will fix it.\u00a0 Come January, Leader McCarthy will have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make border security bill H.R. 1 and prove that conservatives have what it takes to govern. Americans are counting on him. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JESSICA ANDERSON",

    "body": "The GOP objects to Jones' statement; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats' quest\u00a0to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state hit a big roadblock this week in the form of a fellow Democrat.\u00a0\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he opposed Congress alone creating the new state and he believes, like Republicans have argued, that statehood for the nation's capital needs to be done through a constitutional amendment.\u00a0\n\"If Congress wants to make D.C. a state, it should propose a constitutional amendment,\" Manchin said in an interview with the West Virginia MetroNews radio network, according to The Associated Press. \"It should propose a constitutional amendment and let the people of America vote.\"\nHOUSE PASSES DC STATEHOOD BILL TO MAKE DISTRICT 51ST STATE AFTER HEATED FLOOR DEBATE\nIn a 50-50 split Senate, D.C. statehood already had a tough shot of becoming a reality because as long as the legislative filibuster is in place the proposal would require 60 votes to advance. Republicans have been squarely opposed to elevating the\u00a0federal district to statehood\u00a0status arguing it's an unconstitutional powerplay by Democrats to add two more liberal senators to the upper chamber.\u00a0\n\n      Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., adjusts his face mask as he arrives for votes on Biden administration nominees, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Manchin said he's against D.C. Statehood passing unilaterally through Congress. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n      \n\n\nManchin, a moderate member from a red state, has been outspoken in his opposition to eliminating the legislative filibuster too. His siding with Republicans on various issues has frustrated liberals who want to use the slim Democratic majority in the House and Senate to pass major priorities like federal voting\u00a0rights legislation, police reform, D.C. statehood and raising the minimum wage to $15.\u00a0\nBIDEN WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALLY SUPPORTS MAKING DC THE 51ST STATE\nThe House earlier this month passed legislation to make\u00a0Washington, D.C., the 51st state and to grant its roughly\u00a0700,000 residents\u00a0full representation in\u00a0Congress.\u00a0The strictly party-line vote in the House was 216 to 208, with all Republicans rejecting the statehood bill, dubbed H.R. 51.\u00a0The legislation has\u00a0support from President Biden.\nD.C.'s lone non-voting delegate in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, has argued that the district should be no different than the 37 others states that Congress admitted to the union without a constitutional amendment. She put out a new statement on Friday, not mentioning Manchin by name, saying the 23rd Amendment does\u00a0not need to be\u00a0repealed before Congress grants statehood.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Those who make such an assertion are conflating a policy choice and a constitutional requirement,\" Norton said.",

    "body": "Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.) said Democratic leaders must work \u201cgingerly\u201d to keep their members together on the floor, particularly on what he termed \"messaging\" bills that have little chance in the 50-50 Senate and already generate internal divisions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd, you know, when you're controlling both chambers and the White House and you\u2019re still doing messaging bills. That\u2019s going to kill us in the midterms,\u201d Brown said. But he added, \u201cthe speaker\u2019s a master at this.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are moving legislation at a rapid clip for now, fast-tracking bills that were passed in the last Congress. They're eager to show their base the type of progress that can come from electing Democrats to take full control of Washington. But taking big swings can mean taking big risks.\n\nAnd unity tests are looming as many Democrats admit they\u2019re still struggling to navigate a political landscape reshaped by the Jan. 6 insurrection. Their lingering distrust of GOP colleagues who opposed certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s win spilled out onto the House floor after weeks of emotional conversations in private \u2014 threatening to hobble any chance of cross-aisle work in the House. \n\nIt all started as lawmakers from both parties packed the steps of the Capitol on Tuesday night for a candlelight vigil marking a half-million U.S. deaths from the coronavirus. Behind closed doors, Pelosi's team was hustling to avoid an embarrassing defeat on the most mundane of congressional business: a bill to name a post office. \n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) angered Democratic leaders by forcing a roll call vote on the bill, wanting to send a message that Democrats wouldn\u2019t work with Republicans who have refused to denounce the pro-Trump rioters of Jan. 6. But top Democrats worried the move would have unforeseen ramifications, effectively torpedoing the House\u2019s current practice of allowing quick consideration of noncontroversial, bipartisan bills by all members. The bill ultimately passed easily.\n\n\u201cThere need to be serious consequences for trying to overturn the results of our election. I think there\u2019s just a spectrum in the caucus right now on what that looks like,\u201d said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was one of 15 Democrats who sided with Casten on the post office vote.\n\nNow Pelosi and her leadership team must turn their attention to the intra-party fissures ahead as they take up several high-profile bills. Some will be easier than others, such as a long-delayed reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Other bills on the docket involve tricky politics, whether the immigration status of farm workers or public funding of elections. \n\nIn only the second month of Democrats' unified power over government, the limits of control are becoming clear. For many Democrats, passing legislation during the last Congress that was likely to run aground in a GOP Senate was one thing. Now that bills the House passes stand a real chance of becoming law, Democrats are suddenly looking harder at their own decisions.\n\n\u201cI know we're going to have a lot of political to-and-froing, but I think this is going to be a very productive Congress,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. \n\nThat dynamic is complicating next week\u2019s passage of a sweeping voting rights and government reform bill, one of the Democrats\u2019 highest priorities from last Congress. \n\nSenior Democrats are confident they will pass the bill, which carries the high-priority ranking of H.R. 1. But an influential group of Congressional Black Caucus leaders, several of them from the south, are raising objections to a provision that would require states to cede control of their redistricting decisions to independent commissions. The CBC members fear such a massive overhaul could be weaponized by GOP-controlled legislatures to undermine Black voters, but the bill's supporters say there are protections already in place under law.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), who will likely oppose H.R. 1 without a change to the redistricting language, said he had the same qualms when the bill passed in 2019. But it\u2019s simply tougher to support the expansive bill now, he explained, since the provision he objects to could actually become law this Congress.\n\n\u201cLast year, H.R. 1 was more aspirational,\u201d Johnson said in an interview. \u201cYou have to be more careful about what you let go to the Senate.\u201d \n\nTop Democrats, including Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and John Sarbanes (D-Md.), have been privately meeting with CBC members to hear their concerns. Some CBC members have also heard from former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is leading Democrats\u2019 national redistricting overhaul effort. Lofgren and Sarbanes huddled with Pelosi, Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn Wednesday on the issue. \n\nCBC Chair Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) said those discussions are helping to whittle down the number of her members who oppose the bill \u2014 which she called a \u201cgood sign,\u201d though she declined to say whether she was prepared to support the legislation. \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of great stuff in the bill, but obviously I want to make sure we don\u2019t dilute minority representation,\u201d Beatty said, noting there is still some talk of amending the language. \n\nThat bill is expected to reach the floor next week, along with another broadly popular bill from last Congress that\u2019s run into new headwinds this year. \n\nOn the Democrats\u2019 sweeping policing reform bill, a group of moderates are attempting to roll back language that seeks to hold police officers legally accountable for alleged misconduct, changing a doctrine known as qualified immunity. The centrists pushing back on that issue all backed the policing bill last summer. \n\nThey argue that keeping the qualified immunity provision as written would tank negotiations with the roughly 10 Republicans who would need to support the bill in the Senate. Most Democrats, though, argue the language is a crucial piece to holding officers responsible for any crimes committed on the job.\n\nFor the next two years, a group of just five House Democrats have the power to tank any bill they don\u2019t like by voting no on the floor. So far, none have shown the willingness to blow it up. Privately, some members believe such a stunning moment could happen soon but acknowledge they face intense pressure to stay together.\n\nMeanwhile, the bad feelings in the wake of Jan. 6 remain unresolved for many Democrats. \n\nThere\u2019s lingering anger within the caucus about what several Democrats privately described as their leadership\u2019s failure to start a \u201cfamily conversation\u201d until this week about interacting with Republicans in a post-Jan. 6 world. Senior Democrats counter that there\u2019s no way they could institute any kind of caucus-wide policy on the issue and say they have addressed it in numerous conversations before this week.\n\nCasten defended himself on a private caucus call mid-week, saying he didn\u2019t want to be ostracized as the \u201cThomas Massie of the left,\" according to several people listening \u2014 referring to a Kentucky House Republican who has alienated many in his conference. But Casten is one of several Democrats who have drafted their own kind of \u201cblacklist,\u201d refusing to work with any GOP members who supported Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election.\n\nHouse Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said on the call that she didn\u2019t plan to bring up bills in her committee that were cosponsored by those Republicans, according to two Democrats.\n\nOn the call, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders advised each member to do what\u2019s right for their districts while underscoring that they wouldn\u2019t allow the full institutional breakdown that would result if Democrats stopped working with Republicans outright. \n\n\u201cIn the context of interacting with those who continue to provide aid and comfort to a violent insurrection,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said, \"everyone\u2019s going to have to make individual decisions.\"\n\nAlly Mutnick contributed.",

Democrats say the changes would have an outsize impact on Black voters. \u201cWe all need to continue to use our platform,\u201d Mr. James wrote to his 49 million followers on Twitter on Tuesday, sharing a link to a report about the campaign in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . \u201cThis last election won't change anything if we don't keep working.\u201d The group's plans include a social media campaign and interviews with league stars promoting expanded voting rights, according to a statement. Advertisement The All-Star Game campaign comes as House Democrats in Washington prepared on Wednesday to pass omnibus federal voting legislation that would blunt attempts by Republican-led states to impose new restrictions to the ballot box. In addition to Georgia, new voting restrictions have passed in Iowa, and many other states are lining up similar efforts Among the provisions in the House bill, designated H.R. 1 by Democrats to reflect its importance to their agenda, are strict national requirements that would disallow restrictive voter identification laws enacted by states, mandate automatic voter registration, vastly expand early and mail-in voting, and restore voting rights to former felons. Proponents expect the changes to increase voting in Black and Latino communities. The bill would also eliminate partisan gerrymandering, impose new transparency on dark money in the campaign finance system and tighten government ethics standards. Democrats expected to pass the bill through the House in the face of unified Republican opposition. Its fate in the Senate, where Democrats have only narrow control, appeared uncertain; unless Democrats agree to significantly alter the bill or eliminate the legislative filibuster that requires them to win at least 10 Republican votes, it has little chance of becoming law. Advertisement House Democrats intend to hold a separate vote in the coming months on legislation to restore key enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 . But that effort also faces an exceedingly narrow path in the Senate.",

At the signing ceremony in Qatar, Pompeo posed for photos alongside the Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar, who is anticipated to head the next Taliban government in Afghanistan.\nAt the time, critics blasted the Trump administration for excluding the Afghan government, saying it undercut its legitimacy.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming. H.R. McMaster, Trump's national security advisor from 2017 to 2018, denounced Trump's Taliban deal as a \"surrender agreement.\"\nPompeo and Trump have attempted to absolve themselves of the situation in Afghanistan and blamed Biden for the fallout.\n\"I hope this Administration comes to understand that apologizing, placating, appeasing, being weak, only presents risks to American security,\" Pompeo tweeted on Thursday.",

    "body": "The vote is a striking setback for Democrats' $3.5 trillion package. Drug pricing is intended to be a key way to pay for the package. Leadership can still add a version of the provision back later in the process, but the move shows the depth of some moderate concerns. The three moderates said they worried the measure would harm innovation from drug companies and pushed a scaled-back rival measure. The pharmaceutical industry has also attacked Democratic leaders' measure, known as H.R. 3, as harming innovation. The three lawmakers had long signaled their concerns with the drug pricing measure, but actually voting it down in the House Energy and Commerce Committee is an escalation. Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) had implored the three lawmakers to vote in favor of the measure to at least keep the process going. \"Vote to move forward today,\" he said to the moderates in his party. \"Vote to continue the conversation.\" Still, Pallone said he is confident that some form of measure to lower drug prices will make it into the final package. The House legislation was already expected to change before the final version, given moderate Democratic concerns in the Senate as well. Senate Democrats are working on their own bill, which is not yet finalized but is expected to be less far-reaching. \"I know it is going to have drug pricing reform,\" Pallone said of the final bill, noting that negotiations with the Senate would continue over the coming weeks. Still, the move on Wednesday is a show of force from the moderates. Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Democrats were not giving up on including drug pricing measures. \"Polling consistently shows immense bipartisan support for Democrats' drug price negotiation legislation, including overwhelming majorities of Republicans and independents who are fed up with Big Pharma charging Americans so much more than they charge for the same medicines overseas,\" he said in a statement after the vote. \"Delivering lower drug costs is a top priority of the American people and will remain a cornerstone of the Build Back Better Act as work continues between the House, Senate and White House on the final bill.\" Updated at 3:21 p.m.",

    "body": "Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) joined the Guy Benson Show to discuss why he voted against a bill to codify same-sex marriage into law, as some worry the supreme court might strike down gay marriage next.\n\nCongressman Gallagher explained his vote by saying,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I think needs to be fixed, and I think it would both increase the chances of something passing in the Senate and also reduce the likelihood of whatever passes being challenged in court and then this being litigated endlessly. And first, let me be clear. I am not endorsing the so-called slippery slope argument, but I do believe this provision may inadvertently give oxygen to that argument. So this bill, H.R. 84, repeals DOMA. It does not, as you point out, and as some on the right are erroneously claiming. It doesn\u2019t force states to marry same sex couples. It just requires them to recognize legal same sex marriages from other states. For example, if a gay couple lived in a state where gay marriage was permitted, then moved to a state where it was not, that state would have to recognize the marriage for tax and benefit purposes. It\u2019s very similar in concept to the idea of concealed carry reciprocity, which most conservatives support. But the reciprocity provisions are contradictory. So when it speaks about reciprocity between the states and invokes the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, it explicitly says pertaining to a marriage between two individuals, two individuals, two human beings. That\u2019s the key phrase when speaking about reciprocity between states and the federal government. However, the resolution omits the qualifier between two individuals and instead says that an individual\u2019s marriage should be considered valid simply if it\u2019s valid in the state the marriage was entered into. So the second provision would force the federal government to recognize a marriage beyond two people. Is just one state permitted it. I concede no state permits it now. You may view that as a low probability outcome, but in my mind it\u2019s higher than the probability Obergefell gets overturned.\u201d",

    "body": "The House on Wednesday voted to eliminate the CDC\u2019s vaccine requirement for U.S. visitors.\n\nProposed by GOP Representative Thomas Massie, the bill, H.R. 185, would \u201cterminate the requirement imposed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for proof of COVID-19 vaccination for foreign travelers, and for other purposes.\u201d The measure, which was co-sponsored by 22 Republicans, succeeded in the chamber on a mostly party-line vote of 227-201, with seven Democrats voting along with Republicans to approve it.\n\nThe original order, published on April 7, 2022, restricted the entry of non-citizens who are not immigrants into the United States by air travel unless they were fully vaccinated against the virus.\n\nMassie\u2019s measure was forward-thinking, as it also nullified any future vaccine restrictions for foreign visitors as a condition of entry and prohibited \u201cthe use of federal funds to administer or enforce such a requirement.\u201d\n\nOn the House floor, Massie pointed out the Biden administration\u2019s hypocrisy in maintaining the vaccine requirement for foreigners but allowing unprecedented illegal immigration into the country.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the logic of having a vaccine mandate on legal international travelers but not on the millions of people who are pouring across our border? Where\u2019s the logic in that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYou want a list of countries that don\u2019t have this mandate? Australia, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Spain, Germany, France, Ukraine,\u201d Massie said. \u201cDictatorships have already gotten rid of this vaccinate mandate. Russia, Syria, China, Cuba even doesn\u2019t have this draconian, xenophobic measure at the border.\u201d\n\nEven with the pandemic in the past, the Biden administration has still not revoked his national emergency concerning Covid which former president Trump made in March 2020. In January, Republican Representative Paul Gosar introduced a resolution to end the national emergency. On January 30, Biden announced that he plans to discontinue both the national emergency and the public-health emergency declarations on May 11, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhy does Biden want to delay ending the COVID emergency for another 100 days? Because he wants to use emergency authorities to shove more money out of the door. It\u2019s been 1000+ days to slow the spread. End the COVID emergency NOW,\u201d Massie tweeted on February 1.\n\nMore from National Review",

To understand the molecular mechanisms affected in the gonads of breeder fish after an immune challenge, we investigated the metabolome and the transcriptome profiles in zebrafish testes after inducing an immune response. After 48\u202fh of the immune challenge, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (LC-MS) and transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq (Illumina) resulted in 20 different released metabolites and 80 differentially expressed genes. Among these, glutamine and succinic acid were the most abundant metabolites released and 27,5% of the genes belong to either the immune or reproduction systems. Pathway analysis based on metabolomic and transcriptomic crosstalk identified cad and iars genes that act simultaneously with succinate metabolite. This study deciphers interactions between reproduction and immune systems and provides a basis to improve protocols in generating more resistant broodstock.\n  Keywords  Immune Reproduction Metabolites Transcripts Markers\n  Aquaculture\n  View PDF\n  Data availability  Data will be made available on request.\n  Cited by (0)  \u00a9 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.\n  No metrics available.\n  View details\n  About ScienceDirect Remote access Shopping cart Advertise Contact and support Terms and conditions Privacy policy\n  We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Daniel Webster (R-FL) and Colin Allred (D-TX) for introducing bipartisan legislation to create a nationally chartered bank to provide capital for infrastructure projects throughout the United States. The Federal Infrastructure Bank, as it's called, will receive no federal funds or government guarantees.\n The bill, \u201cThe Federal Infrastructure Bank Act of 2023,\u201d H.R. 490 , was introduced and referred to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, of which both Congressmen are members.\n  J. Patrick Cave, president of the Alliance for Financing U.S. Infrastructure, called the bill \u201can important milestone on the march to securing the world's greatest infrastructure for this nation. Infrastructure is not just an economic boon. It boosts national security at a time of heightened threats around the world.\u201d\n  \u201cAmerica's infrastructure is long overdue for critical repairs and needed advancements,\u201d said Rep. Webster. \u201cThis bank will work with state and local partners to facilitate private infrastructure investments, creating a much-needed mechanism for projects to access necessary funding.\u201d\n  \"Our rapid growth in Texas requires us to use every tool we can to invest in our infrastructure so our economy can grow an we can remain competitive,\" said Rep. Allred. \"This bipartisan bill will create a national infrastructure bank, modeled after similar banks in states across the country to leverage the private sector to spur sustained, long-term investment to create jobs and help meet our infrastructure needs. I am proud to join my fellow Transportation & Infrastructure Committee colleague Congressman Webster on this bill and look forward to working together to invest in our infrastructure.\"\n  Even after funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that at least another $2 trillion is needed to bring U.S. infrastructure up to acceptable levels \u2013 and much more to become the global leader.

Brown (D-OH) and Collins (R-ME) and Reps. Walberg (R-MI) and Courtney (D-CT)oHou. Today, federal employees can choose a nurse practitioner (NP) as their health care provider under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, yet outdated federal law prevents these same providers from certifying and overseeing the care of federal employees' workplace-related injuries. This bill would ensure federal workers receive access to high-quality health care for work-related injuries from their chosen health care provider.\n\nThere are more than 355,000 licensed NPs in the U.S. who provide care in communities of all sizes and this year the profession was named the top job in health care.\n\n\"I urge members of Congress to support this legislation and reduce barriers to timely care delivery,\" said April Kapu.\n\n\"This bipartisan legislation would give federal workers timely access to the care they need when they need it most,\" said AANP President April Kapu, DNP, APRN, ACNP-BC, FAANP, FCCM, FAAN. \"The bill would authorize nurse practitioners to certify federal workplace injuries and oversee treatment of injured workers. I urge all members of Congress to support this legislation and reduce unnecessary barriers to timely care delivery. On behalf of AANP and the more than 355,000 licensed NPs in the U.S., we thank Senators Brown and Collins and Representatives Walberg and Courtney for their dedication to improving health care access for federal employees, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to pass this important legislation.\"\n\nThe American Association of Nurse Practitioners\u00ae (AANP) is the largest professional membership organization for nurse practitioners (NPs) of all specialties.

We are grateful to our champions Congressmen Quigley and Fortenberry and leaders throughout the House for making today's passage a reality.  With more than 330 House and 50 Senate cosponsors, this critical bill has more cosponsors than any bill introduced in Congress this year. Today's vote brings this legislation one step closer to making a meaningful difference in the lives of those living with ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases.  ACT for ALS creates a new grant program that funds access to investigational ALS treatments for people living with ALS who cannot participate in clinical trials, while also supporting research on treatment safety and ALS progression.  The legislation invests in neurodegenerative disease research through a brand-new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program. This program is critically important to keeping FDA and other federal agencies moving urgently to find treatments and cures that can be approved by the FDA, covered by health insurance and made available to all.  Finally, the ACT for ALS would establish a Health and Human Services (HHS) Public-Private Partnership for Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases jointly led by the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the first federal entity explicitly charged with the responsibility to speed the development and approval of therapies for rare neurodegenerative diseases.  'Today, we celebrate the fierce community of advocates who were relentless in making ACT for ALS the most cosponsored bill in this Congress,' I AM ALS Director of Science and Policy Dr. Megan Miller said. 'Today's overwhelming support and passage in the House of Representatives is a direct result of the advocates' unwavering determination to improve the lives of people living with ALS today and in the future. I AM ALS stands united with them in calling for immediate action in the Senate. It is time we act with the urgency this disease requires.'  The ALS Association Chief Mission Officer Dr. Neil Thakur said, 'We have worked closely with Congress and advocates on this measure to provide funding for early access to ALS investigational therapies as well as new funds to FDA for ALS research to develop cures and treatments. People with ALS can't wait, and passage of this bill is urgently needed.'  'Today's overwhelmingly bipartisan House passage of the ACT for ALS further emphasizes the importance of enacting this legislation as soon as possible. Now it is time for the Senate to act. The Muscular Dystrophy Association stands behind this legislation and is eager to work with the bill sponsors and Senate leaders to make this a reality,' said Paul Melmeyer, Vice President, Public Policy and Advocacy, Muscular Dystrophy Association.\"  View original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/three-leading-als-organizations-celebrate-house-passage-of-act-for-als-call-for-swift-senate-action-301440786.html  SOURCE Muscular Dystrophy Association  COMTEX_398568044/2454/2021-12-08T19:45:13  Is there a problem with this press release?

They are staging an assault on the right to vote : reducing early voting, restricting registration and reversing the rollout of voting by mail. We all know why: They need to entrench their diminishing hold on power by disenfranchising voters of color. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. arrow-right As a member of the most diverse Congress in U.S. history and one of the first openly gay Black members of Congress, I know that we are closer to building a true, multiracial democracy than ever before. But twice before in our nation's history, we have tried to build a multiracial democracy. And twice before, white supremacists have devised ways to disenfranchise people of color. Story continues below advertisement In 1870, during Reconstruction, Congress adopted the 15th Amendment , outlawed disenfranchisement on the basis of race and created the Justice Department in part to empower Black voters. Advertisement But white supremacists soon got around that. If they couldn't disenfranchise on the basis of race, they would disenfranchise people like me using proxies for race. They required voters to pass arbitrary \u201cliteracy tests,\u201d then denied Black citizens access to education. They required voters to pay poll taxes, then plundered Black communities. They barred people convicted of crimes from voting, then invented new crimes and found Black people guilty of them. And they killed whomever they had to in order to overthrow multiracial state governments. Story continues below advertisement These strategies led millions of Black Americans, including my grandparents, to flee the Jim Crow South in search of freedom. After North Carolina reelected George Henry White to Congress in 1898, the South would not elect another Black American to Congress until 1972, when Texas elected Barbara Jordan to the House and Georgia elected Andrew Young to the same body. Advertisement In 1965, during what many call the Second Reconstruction, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which renewed our democracy's opposition to racial discrimination. The law enacted real protections to safeguard voting rights for Black people across the South for the first time. And it restored the Justice Department to its original primary role of ensuring that we were not systematically denied the right to vote. But in recent years, a far-right majority on the Supreme Court has enabled white supremacists to circumvent the Voting Rights Act, striking down the strongest protections \u2014 as in Shelby County v. Holder \u2014 and weakening others. Story continues below advertisement We now find ourselves at a crossroads. For the first time in 10 years, the Democratic Party controls Congress and the White House. Building a multiracial democracy will not be easy. But if we do not act now, it may soon be impossible. Advertisement Now is the time for a Third Reconstruction \u2014 one that abolishes Jim Crow once and for all. That means making voting as easy as possible for everyone, by establishing automatic voter registration, protecting our voter rolls from purges, and ensuring universally accessible ballots for seniors, people with disabilities and anyone else who needs an accommodation. That means restoring that right to the 5.2 million people , disproportionately Black and brown, who have been disenfranchised because of felony convictions. Second, we must end partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts. That's the distorting system that has evolved to permit politicians to choose their voters rather than voters to choose their politicians. Congress's power to right this wrong is beyond dispute. As even Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the Supreme Court in 2013, the Constitution's elections clause gives Congress the \u201cauthority to provide a complete code for congressional elections.\u201d Until we end partisan gerrymandering, a declining White minority will wield it to deny communities of color the representation they deserve \u2014 packing them into safe districts to waste their votes or spreading them out to diffuse their power. Meanwhile, QAnon conspiracy theorists will continue coasting to victory in general elections after prevailing in Republican primaries. These are distortions of our democracy. Story continues below advertisement Third, we must end the pernicious power of Big Money, which converts the racial wealth gap into a political power gap. An under-told truth of our politics is that the donor class often anoints the candidates who make it on the ballot. That donor class is overwhelmingly White and conservative. And that big-money gatekeeping disproportionately excludes candidates of color, who rely more on small donations. Advertisement Public campaign financing would amplify the voices of communities of color. The For the People Act , commonly known as H.R.1 or S.1, would match every dollar donated up to $200 with $6 raised from penalties on corporations that have broken the law. A $50 donation would become a $350 donation. In New York City, a limited, small-donor matching program has already fostered more representative donors and candidates for city offices. This transformation of our democracy will not happen overnight. But Congress can bring us closer than ever before by passing the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act \u2014 uncompromised. If we squander this opportunity, future generations will not \u2014 and should not \u2014 forgive us.

As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news, Mr. Chapman said his \u201cgut dropped to the floor,\u201d and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately.  \u201cI've been through layoffs and usually there's closure because you talk to H.R., you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes,\u201d Mr. Chapman said. \u201cThere's no closure here. You're staring at an empty screen in your house.\u201d  It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email, reviewed by The Times, that explained the terms of the termination, Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday, the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy, certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn).  Mr. Chapman said that the chief executive's messaging about fired employees \u201cstealing\u201d from the company by working only two hours a day \u2014 which the former employee said was contradicted by his team's recent promotions and raises \u2014 had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs.  Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the company's site, Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had \u201cblundered\u201d the approach.",

It also featured reforms to tighten campaign finance regulations and fortify federal ethics rules.\u00a0\n\n                        \n                        It seemed to have significant momentum in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and outgoing President Donald Trump's continued denial of his 2020 presidential election loss.\nBut not everyone shared Pelosi's urgency to pass the bill \u2014 and she quickly found herself clashing with key White House advisors over what she saw as a lack of urgency and commitment to the measure.\u00a0\nPelosi, the authors wrote, grew increasingly \"frustrated\" with the White House for not taking a more hands-on role in lobbying for the bill on Capitol Hill.\u00a0\nIn one meeting detailed in the book, Pelosi \"trashed\" senior White House advisor Anita Dunn \u2014 behind Dunn's back \u2014 for doubting the necessity of the legislation, the authors wrote. When White House chief of staff Ron Klain tried to defend Dunn, Pelosi called Klain's dedication to the bill into question, too, the book says.\u00a0\n\n                        \n                        And \"if Pelosi was incensed, Biden's advisers were equally annoyed by her attachment to the catch-all bill, especially some of the proposed campaign finance restrictions that they feared would hinder Democrats more than Republicans,\" the authors wrote.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nThe book did not specify which campaign finance reforms White House officials objected to in the bill.\nBut the bill included major elements of the DISCLOSE Act, a bill that would crack down on nonprofit and social welfare organizations that aren't required to disclose their donors spending so-called \"dark money\" to influence elections. It also called for an overhaul of the bipartisan Federal Election Commission, whose commissioners often disagree on how to enforce federal campaign finance laws.\u00a0\nMany Democrats have denounced the rise of \"dark money\" on the right. But Democrats are increasingly benefiting from \"dark\" and hard-to-trace campaign spending themselves. Liberal nonprofits are catching up to and, by some accounts, even exceeding \"dark money\" spending from conservative money in both federal and state-level elections.\n\n                        \n                        And Biden, who has so far declined to take executive actions that would dramatically reshape the FEC, was \"somewhat ambivalent\" about the legislation's priorities.\u00a0\n\"The president's main concern was not gerrymandering or campaign finance reform, but election subversion by foreign enemies or domestic saboteurs,\" the authors wrote. \"Pelosi's cherished bill did nothing to address that threat.\"\u00a0\n\n                      \n                            \n                          \n                            \n                              House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, joined by Texas lawmakers, speaks at a news conference on a voting rights bill on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 15, 2021.\n                            \n                      \n                              \n                                AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\n                              \n                          \n                      It was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer who had the far tougher hand in getting voting rights measures that drew near-nonexistent Republican support through an evenly-divided Senate under the current filibuster rules.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe authors described Schumer as \"depleted\" and \"adrift\" over the fate of voting rights as Republicans filibustered every bill he brought to the floor.\n\n                        \n                        The Senate leader was tasked simultaneously with fielding discontent from donors and anger from voting rights advocates over the lack of progress while lobbying moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to soften their long-held opposition to weakening the filibuster.\u00a0\nManchin helped draft and got behind the Freedom to Vote Act, a slimmed-down version of H.R. 1 that focused on voting rights \u2014 and named for the late congressman John Lewis that would restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u00a0\nIn January of 2022, Schumer brought both bills, combined into one package, to the floor \u2014 along with a plan to force a vote on filibuster reform.\nBut Manchin and Sinema joined all 50 Senate Republicans in voting against a one-time change to the chamber's filibuster rules that would more easily allow Democrats to pass the measures along party lines, striking the fatal blow to Democrats' voting rights push.\u00a0\n\n                        \n                        White House press secretary Jen Psaki, for her part, offered a far more optimistic spin on the state of American democracy than Pelosi's reported comment that lawmakers should \"give up and go the beach\" if voting rights and democracy reform protections didn't pass.\u00a0\n\"My advice to everyone out there who's frustrated, sad, angry, pissed off: feel those emotions, go to a kickboxing class, have a margarita, do whatever you need to do this weekend, and then wake up on Monday morning, we gotta keep fighting,\" Psaki said in an interview of ABC's \"The View\" after the defeat of the bills.\u00a0\nPelosi's office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.",

    "body": "House Democrats' top legislative priority \u2014 the H.R. 1 For the People Act of 2021 \u2014 is 791 pages of big election changes.\n\nThe legislation \u2014 a wish list of policies voting rights advocates have urged lawmakers to adopt for years \u2014 rethinks the entire voting process: how people register to vote, how ballots are cast and how states conduct elections. The goal is to improve access, particularly for voters of color.\n\nThe bill would also create public financing systems for campaigns and ethics rules for candidates.\n\n\"This is the next great civil rights bill,\" said Elizabeth Hira, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, who helped craft the bill in her previous job with the House of Representatives.\n\nVoting rights advocates say the legislation could help prevent gerrymandering and restrictive voting laws.\n\nWendy Weiser, vice president of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, said H.R. 1 would \"thwart\" nearly all of the more than 200 restrictive voting proposals her group has identified in 43 states.\n\nThe bill stands little chance in the Senate under its current rules: Even though Democrats have a slim majority, at least 10 Republican votes would be needed to pass it.\n\nRepublicans argue that the legislation would federalize election administration, and they have worked to mobilize supporters against it.\n\nHere's what the bill would do:\n\nThe bill sets out to make it easier to get on and stay on voter registration rolls.\n\nH.R. 1 would require states to offer online voter registration systems \u2014 which 40 states and Washington, D.C., already allow \u2014 and same-day voter registration during federal elections. It would also require local officials to automatically register eligible voters.\n\nEighteen states already have some type of automatic registration, and national implementation could register 50 million new voters, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nThe bill would also limit how states can purge voter rolls and require the U.S. Postal Service to facilitate voter registration updates when people fill out change-of-address forms.\n\nThe bill would require states to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister when they get their driver's licenses so they would be able to vote when they turn 18.\n\n\"That really matters, because Generation Z and Generation Y collectively are the largest voting bloc. They just surpassed the boomers in the power of their vote,\" Hira said.\n\nSeveral of the bill's measures aim to make voting easier and quicker.\n\nThe bill would require states to allow all voters the option of voting by mail, and it would mandate 15 consecutive days of in-person early voting for at least 10 hours a day.\n\nThe bill would stop state lawmakers who are already trying to place more, not fewer, restrictions on mail voting.\n\nStates would be required to notify voters seven days before elections if their polling places have changed.\n\nThe bill also seeks to force states to address long wait times on Election Day, requiring the allocation of enough resources to ensure that voters don't wait longer than 30 minutes.\n\nThe bill would restore voting rights for felons who have completed their prison sentences.\n\nSome states bar citizens with felony convictions from voting for some period of time, such as during probation.\n\nThe provision could restore voting rights for millions. The Sentencing Project, a group advocating for criminal justice reforms, estimated in 2020 that 5.2 million Americans are disenfranchised by felony convictions. At least 2.2 million of them have completed their sentences in full and would be enfranchised, as well as those completing sentences outside of prison, like probation.\n\nIt's estimated that 900,000 of those disenfranchised former felons live in Florida, the group notes.\n\n\"The single greatest impact is in Florida, where voters overwhelmingly voted for a similar policy that got thwarted by legislation,\" Weiser said, pointing to a ballot measure that passed in 2018, only to be effectively nullified by state legislators.\n\nThe bill would ban district maps that \"unduly\" favor one party or another as measured by \"scientifically accepted measures of partisan fairness.\" The bill doesn't finger a specific formula; several have been used in the past.\n\nBoth parties gerrymander, but in 2010, Republicans controlled more state governments and more redistricting processes.\n\nTechnological advances in the last two decades have made gerrymandering, the practice of drawing district lines that benefit one party over another, incredibly effective. Critics say it makes it too easy for politicians to pick their voters, when it should be the other way around.\n\n\"It could be transformative,\" said redistricting expert Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center. \"Otherwise, you're going to see maps rigged in such a way that the result is predetermined.\"\n\nA number of states have embraced independent redistricting commissions on their own, but the majority of states still let their legislatures draw the maps.\n\nBecause of the 2020 census, all states are due to redraw their maps in the next year. Republicans control the process in more states, and Democrats see changing the rules as a way to more evenly distribute control of the process.\n\nThe bill would establish a number of parameters to improve election security: standards for election vendors, rules for communicating potential cyberattacks to federal authorities and requirements for states to protect voter registration databases from cyberattacks.\n\nThe bill would also create a security bounty program, which would allow security analysts to be paid for finding security flaws in the election system.\n\nThe bill would create a system of public financing for congressional candidates that would match donations under $200 with six times the funding if the candidates agreed to rules that would include not accepting donations over $1,000.\n\nUnder the proposed system, $100 donations would get candidates an additional $600 in public funds, for a total of $700.\n\nCandidates would be required to disclose all contributions and return unspent public funds over $100,000.\n\nThe bill also seeks to revamp the public financing system for presidential races, which most major-party candidates used until 2008, when Barack Obama opted out of the system. The bill would up the public match for small donations, bar candidates from accepting donations larger than $1,000 and update the system's rules and restrictions.\n\nThe bill would also test out a voucher program in three states that would let voters allocate $25 to the candidate of their choice; the system is based on a similar program in Seattle.",

But in many cases the statute provides for only modest financial recovery for consumers; the statutory damages provision was last meaningfully updated over forty years ago.

    "body": "How does the 1965 Voting Rights Act work? This is the far-reaching question that the Supreme Court will broach when it decides on a pair of voting laws passed by Arizona's legislature in 2016. It is the most important voting rights case in a decade. In recent months, Republican legislatures have adopted new laws that seek to restrict voting, laws that Democrats argue will disproportionately affect minority voters. What arguments have been made in the case? And what implications will the decision have? Advertisement On today's episode Adam Liptak , a reporter covering the United States Supreme Court for The New York Times. Background reading The Supreme Court has signaled that it could tighten the standards for using the Voting Rights Act to challenge all kinds of voting restrictions. The sprawling voting rights legislation known as H.R. 1 could result in lawsuits leading to a dozen Supreme Court cases , according to legal experts. There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily.

Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) added that Republicans are \"carving up left and right\" in rabidly partisan states, while Democrats, rather, are \"unilaterally disarming,\" perPolitico.For example, when Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek (D) this spring offered an effective redistricting veto in exchange for the right's cooperation with her legislative agenda, Democrats were \"unsparing\" in their condemnation, writes Politico. Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) said that was like \"shooting yourself in the head.\" Added Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.): \"It was just an abysmally stupid move on her part.\"The number of independent state redistricting commissions has grown over the last decade, concurrent with national Democratic efforts to \"increase voter awareness of gerrymandering,\" a bipartisan practice the left is framing as a \"Republican abomination.\"But as Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin (D) pointed out, \"unless you're going to have everybody do redistricting commissions, our party is at a disadvantage.\" Republicans need only five seats to win back a House majority, which they could attain through \"favorable maps\" in just a few of the places where they already have control \u2014 like Texas, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina, reports Politico.Ill-fated H.R. 1, House Democrats' election reform bill, mandates independent redistricting commissions, but it is unlikely to clear the Senate. Kelly Ward Burton, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said the party will \"fight tooth and nail\" to prevent Republicans from \"locking in gerrymandered maps\" should it fail to pass. \"We will sue them.\"Read more at Politico.

Cory Booker: \"Our nation must reckon with its dark past of slavery and its continued oppression of African-Americans.\" Reply\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) speaks during a Juneteenth reparations rally at Newark City Hall on June 17, 2022 in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nNEWARK, NJ \u2014 There\u2019s a \u201creckoning\u201d due in the United States and New Jersey, supporters of slavery reparations in Newark say.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s largest city has been one of the hotbeds of the reparation movement for years. And it continues to be home to many people who say that the nation \u2013 and the Garden State \u2013 need to atone for one of the darkest chapters of U.S. history. On the federal level, Sen. Cory Booker \u2013 a Newark resident \u2013 recently reintroduced a proposed law that would \u201cstudy the impact of slavery and the continuing discrimination against African-Americans.\u201d It would also make recommendations on reparation proposals for the descendants of slaves.\n\nThe bill, S-40, is the Senate companion to H.R. 40, introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, which has seen popular support from many Newark advocates in the past. Read More: Demand For U.S. Slavery Reparations Continues In Newark \u201cOur nation must reckon with its dark past of slavery and its continued oppression of African-Americans, fueled by white supremacy and racism,\u201d Booker said. \u201cMany of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class have systematically excluded Black individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge my colleagues to support this bill that will address the institutional racism that has suppressed African-Americans prosperity throughout our history and bring our country one step closer to our founding principles of liberty and justice for all,\u201d Booker said. Nearly 200 organizations are supporting the bill, the senator noted. The list can be seen here.\n\nREPARATIONS IN NEW JERSEY Other Newark residents are demanding action on the state level.\n\nIn December, the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice (NJISJ) \u2013 which is based in Newark \u2013 visited the Statehouse in Trenton along with several other advocacy groups to support S-386/A-938, a proposed state law that would to establish a Reparations Task Force in New Jersey. According to the NJISJ, the task force would be charged with \u201cholding a statewide conversation\u201d about New Jersey\u2019s history of slavery and structural racism, and how it connects to the state\u2019s current racial disparities \u2013 some of the worst in the country. Read More: Racial Gaps Still Plague New Jersey, Advocates Say The task force would also propose strategic policy recommendations to repair the harm, the group said. \u201cSurprising to some who think of slavery as a southern problem only, New Jersey, which has been called the \u2018slave state of the North,\u2019 has deep ties to the institution of slavery and its aftermath,\u201d the NJISJ said. \u201cIn fact, New Jersey was the last northern state to abolish slavery and by 1830, over two-thirds of enslaved people in the North lived in the Garden State,\u201d the group added.",

The appointees had been serving on the advisory boards of the Air Force Academy, Naval Academy and U.S. Military Academy at West Point, with six on each board, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Among the Trump appointees were former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster. On Wednesday, the White House defended the move, arguing that it was about qualifications and values, not politics. \u201cThe president's objective is what any president's objective is: to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. \u201cAnd so, yes, that was an ask that was made.\u201d White House asks several Trump appointees to resign from military service academy boards The boards are composed of members of Congress and presidential appointees. Board members serve for three years in an advisory capacity. Conway had been appointed to the Air Force Academy Board of Visitors. Spicer, a Navy Reserve commander, had been serving on the Naval Academy's advisory board. McMaster had been appointed to the advisory board at the U.S. Military Academy; the retired U.S. Army lieutenant general is a West Point graduate and previously taught history there. Retired four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane also was appointed to the U.S. Military Academy Board. Some of the Trump appointees who had been asked to resign responded by defiantly refusing to do so or by criticizing the Biden administration. Conway, in response to the request, tweeted a letter to Biden in which she said: \u201cI'm not resigning, but you should,\u201d saying the White House action \u201cseems petty and political, if not personal.\u201d Russ Vought, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Trump administration, had been serving on the Naval Academy's Board of Visitors.

That\u2019s the first bill they\u2019ve introduced.

I\u2019ve already spoken to Republican leaders in Washington about giving those legislators the support they need, the lawyers, the expertise to help tighten up their election laws so they\u2019re not in the situation again where they were last year where the Democratic governor has the power to unilaterally make changes without the legislature in session, and therefore the legislature can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\n\nCotton concluded, \u201cI think it has to be a very high priority for Republican legislatures across the country to ensure that what were unusual and rush changes to our election practices in a once-in-a-century pandemic are never repeated again.\u201d\n\nH.R. 1, dubbed the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d would nationally\u00a0mandate\u00a0automated mailing out of ballots to registered voters for elections while prohibiting states from having photo-ID requirements for ballot submission or signature verification of ballots.",

    "body": "Democrats and Republicans sparred Monday over statehood for Washington, D.C., with proponents saying residents were due full voting rights and critics calling it a partisan power grab and arguing the city\u2019s unique status raised constitutional hurdles.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing on the H.R. 51 legislation that would give residents full representation in Congress, with two senators and one House member, rather than one nonvoting House delegate. Residents\u2019 power in presidential elections would remain the same, with three electors.\n\nThe effort to make D.C. the 51st state has gained broad support in the Democratic Party, and has the backing of President Biden. The bill is expected to pass the House, but its future in the Senate\u2014where 60 votes would be required for its passage and only 42 of the 50 Democratic senators currently are co-sponsors\u2014is uncertain.\n\nDemocrats say that residents of Washington, D.C., nearly half of whom are Black, deserve the same representation as other Americans. Residents pay federal taxes, register for selective service and fight in the military, but they don\u2019t have a full voice in Congress and local leadership can be overruled by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe disenfranchisement of Washingtonians is one of the remaining civil-rights and voting-rights issues of our time,\u201d said Mayor Muriel Bowser, who was a witness at the hearing. \u201cD.C. residents have all the responsibilities of citizenship, but they have no congressional voting rights and only limited self-government,\u201d said Rep.

    "body": "Former top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday refused President Joe Biden's request to resign from an Air Force Academy advisory board, saying the request is \"petty and political, if not personal.\"\n\nThe administration had sent letters asking several Trump-appointed aides to resign from boards of advisers for military academies by 6 p.m. Wednesday or face termination, Military Times reported.\n\nConway posted a letter refusing to leave the Board of Visitors of the Air Force Academy, saying the removals would \"politicize\" the academies and discourage others from serving.\n\n\"News reports suggest you have made the same demand of other men and women who were duly appointed to service academy boards,\" she said in the letter addressed to Biden, later adding: \"The result is that faithful and willing public servants will be discouraged or thwarted from service. Our service academies will risk being further politicized and polarized.\"\n\nMilitary academies, including the U.S. Military Academy, the Air Force Academy and the Naval Academy, have nonpartisan advisory panels made up of presidential and congressional appointees who serve three-year terms. The boards give the schools nonbinding advice about matters like curriculum and student resources.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Wednesday that Biden had asked several appointees from the previous administration, such as Conway and former press secretary Sean Spicer, to resign from their positions on various service academy boards. Spicer, who also questioned the decision in a tweet, had been appointed to the Naval Academy visitors' board.\n\nPsaki said the move was intended \"to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values.\"\n\nShe added: \"I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified or not political to serve on these boards. But the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration. They are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you're aligned with the values of this administration.\"\n\nOther top officials whose resignations were requested include former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster, according to reports, and former White House budget director Russ Vought. Vought said in a tweet that he will not step down.\n\n\"No. It\u2019s a three year term,\" he tweeted with an image of the request from the White House.",

    "body": "Billie Hayes, who rode a memorable cackle to kiddie-TV fame, playing a witch named Witchiepoo in the short-lived but much remembered 1969 series \u201cH.R. Pufnstuf,\u201d died on April 29 in Los Angeles. She was 96. News of her death was posted on her website. Ms. Hayes had built a moderately successful stage career and had portrayed Mammy Yokum in the 1959 film version of \u201cLi'l Abner\u201d (reprising a role she had played on Broadway) when she was cast as Witchiepoo. \u201cH.R. Pufnstuf\u201d was the first of a string of children's shows made by the brothers Sid and Marty Krofft in the 1970s \u2014 trippy, slapdash-looking affairs that contrasted noticeably with the carefully pitched messages of \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cMister Rogers' Neighborhood,\u201d which were born in the same era. Krofft shows tended toward the bizarre: \u201cLidsville,\u201d for instance, which also starred Ms. Hayes (as well as Charles Nelson Reilly ), involved a land of living hats. Few of the shows lasted long \u2014 \u201cPufnstuf\u201d survived only 17 episodes \u2014 but they made an impression. \u201cThe Kroffts dished up a swirl of psychedelia, vaudeville and cheesy production values that might be described as brown acid for the toddler soul,\u201d Emily Nussbaum wrote in The New York Times in 2004, when TV Land broadcast a marathon of Krofft creations. Advertisement \u201cPufnstuf\u201d was a sort of comic sendup of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d with Witchiepoo pursuing a talking flute possessed by a boy named Jimmy (Jack Wild) in much the way Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West craves Dorothy's ruby slippers. The red wig and elaborate makeup Ms. Hayes wore made her a striking figure, but witchy ineptitude kept Witchiepoo from being too scary. In 1970 she played the character in a film version, called simply \u201cPufnstuf,\u201d in a cast that also included Martha Raye as a character named Boss Witch and Cass Elliot of the Mamas and the Papas as one named Witch Hazel. For years afterward the role made Ms. Hayes popular among casting directors in search of a witch. In 1971 she played one in an episode of the sitcom \u201cBewitched\u201d in which she was ultimately bested by Samantha, the series' star witch, played by Elizabeth Montgomery. In 1985 she was the voice of the witch Orgoch in the animated Disney film \u201cThe Black Cauldron.\u201d She was the voice of a cackling witch in \u201cShrek Forever After\u201d in 2010. Perhaps most memorably, in 1976 the comedian Paul Lynde, with whom she had first worked decades earlier, managed to pair her and Ms. Hamilton in a running sketch on \u201c The Paul Lynde Halloween Special ,\u201d which also featured appearances by Betty White, Donny and Marie Osmond and the rock group Kiss, and which has taken on a sort of kitschy fame. Advertisement \u201cThe two witches bookend Mr. Lynde as they cackle their way through the hardcover editions of \u2018Rosemary's Baby' and \u2018The Exorcist,' call \u2018The Sound of Music' a real horror movie and play Witches' Monopoly, a board game in which contestants can either buy a property or blow it up,\u201d The New York Times wrote in 2007 when a DVD of that television rarity was released. Ms. Hayes played other roles in her somewhat sporadic career, including providing the voices for characters on \u201cThe Brothers Flub,\u201d \u201cTransformers: Rescue Bots\u201d and other animated shows. But Witchiepoo was the one that stuck in people's heads. In 2003 Inside TV ranked her No. 3 on its list of Top 10 witches in TV history, behind only Ms. Montgomery and Catherine Hicks, who played Amanda Tucker on the 1980s series \u201cTucker's Witch.\u201d Billie Armstrong Brosch was born on Aug. 5, 1924, in Du Quoin , Ill. Her father, Charles, was a coal miner, and her mother, Marie (Armstrong) Brosch, was an administrator for the Perry County General Assistance Office. She began performing as a child and continued to do so after leaving high school early, performing in Chicago and with U.S.O. shows. (An agent at the start of her professional career suggested that \u201cBrosch\u201d was not an ear-friendly name for a performer.) She eventually secured a role in a touring show called \u201cWhat's New\u201d with Mr. Lynde. In 1956 Mr. Lynde wrote and directed sketches for a Broadway revue called \u201cNew Faces of 1956,\u201d and Ms. Hayes found herself as one of those new faces \u2014 along with a young British actress named Maggie Smith. Advertisement Ms. Hayes said her commitment to \u201cNew Faces,\u201d which ran for 220 performances, kept her from accepting an offer to originate the role of Mammy Yokum in \u201cLi'l Abner,\u201d a musical based on Al Capp's comic strip characters, when it opened on Broadway in November 1956, but she later stepped into the part, replacing Charlotte Rae. She won the role in the 1959 film version Ms. Hayes was also president of Pet Hope, an animal care organization. She leaves no immediate survivors. In a 1969 interview with the Dallas-area broadcaster Bobbie Wygant, Ms. Hayes noted that, though Witchiepoo was the villain of \u201cPufnstuf,\u201d she received a lot of fan mail from children seeking her help with kid-size problems. \u201cI'm the Ann Landers of the witch world,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know why they pick the witch to write to,\u201d she said, \u201cunless they figure either she's so dumb she'll give me a funny answer or she's so smart I'll get out of trouble.\u201d",

    "body": "(CNN) House Democrats are taking up two separate bills on immigration Thursday, marking the first time Congress will vote on a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants since Democrats won slim majorities in both chambers of Congress with President Joe Biden in the White House.\n\nIn the first vote, the House passed H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California.\n\nIt would provide a pathway to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as \"Dreamers\" as well as for Temporary Protected Status recipients and Deferred Enforced Departure beneficiaries. The legislation stands to make up to 4.4 million individuals eligible for permanent residence, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe House is voting next on H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, bipartisan legislation from Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington.\n\nThe bill would permit farm workers, and their spouses and children, to earn legal status through continued employment in the agricultural sector, and would make changes to the H-2A agricultural guest worker program.\n\n\"This is a very special day for us,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ahead of the vote. \"We are making a very big difference in how we respect the beautiful diversity of America, how we respect the fact that immigration is the constant reinvigoration of America.\"\n\nBoth of these bills have already been passed by the House in previous years but are being voted on again with Democrats holding slim majorities in the House and Senate. They are expected to hit a wall in the Senate.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said ahead of the votes, \"the House will send a clear message that we believe in a just, rational and humane immigration system. I hope that our Senate colleagues will hear us on the other side of the Capitol and will take similar action.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have been hitting the Biden administration on the influx of migrants crossing the border in recent weeks, including the large increase in unaccompanied minors making the trek into the United States.\n\nMany of those migrants crossing the border have said they believe the Biden administration will be more welcoming than the Trump administration, which had adopted a more hardline posture.\n\n\"It's more than a crisis. This is a human heartbreak,\" House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said at a news briefing on a trip to the border this week. \"The sad part about all this, it didn't have to happen. This crisis is created by the presidential policies of this new administration. There's no other way to claim it than a Biden border crisis.\"\n\nThe push to pass these two bills will give House Democrats an opportunity to say they are working to advance immigration reforms, but questions remain over the fate of broader efforts to overhaul the nation's immigration system.\n\nAnd while some progressive Democrats would have liked to see comprehensive immigration reform legislation rather than these two piecemeal bills, other Democrats have thrown cold water on the idea, underscoring how much of an uphill climb it would be to pass a broader immigration package.\n\n\"I don't see a means for reaching that,\" the Illinois Democrat said. \"I want it. I think we are much more likely to deal with discrete elements.\"\n\nWeighing in on the House effort to move immigration bills, Durbin said, \"I think Speaker Pelosi has discovered that she doesn't have support for the comprehensive bill in the House,\" Durbin said. \"And it indicates where it is in the Senate as well.\"\n\nOn Thursday, CNN asked Raul Ruiz, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, about Durbin's comments.\n\n\"There's different multiple routes that we are going to advocate for. We can advocate it through the budget reconciliation process,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if budget reconciliation is possible for an immigration bill, Ruiz responded there's \"political will\" to do so.\n\n\"I think that there is political will and so, you know, that's, that's a different route, whether ... it's a possibility I think we'll have to wait and see, but I think it's a route we're going to be advocating for,\" he responded.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments Thursday.",

James Talarico (D), one of the \u201cfleebaggers,\u201d said on Monday that he and his colleagues are\u00a0prepared to stay out of Texas for the rest of the session to kill the effort:\n\nThe left has since lavished the Democrats with praise, deeming them \u201ccourageous.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris went as far as likening them to those who fought and died for the right to vote.\n\n\u201cI applaud them standing for the rights of all Americans and all Texans to express their voice through their vote, unencumbered,\u201d Harris said during a Monday appearance at the TCF Center in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\u201cI will say that they are leaders who are marching in the path that so many others before did when they fought and many died for our right to vote,\u201d she claimed.\n\nTexas Democrats are celebrating the support they have received from the White House \u2014 particularly President Joe Biden\u2019s call for Congress to pass the For the People Act, which would nationalize U.S. elections and strip states of their ability to implement basic election safeguards that Democrats falsely describe as suppressive.\n\nEarlier this afternoon, President Biden gave a national address calling for further protections for voting rights \u2014 and revived calls for Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Yesterday, Texas Democratic lawmakers made history by leaving the state in order to block Republicans\u2019 latest attacks on voting rights. After Democrats blocked an earlier Republican attack this spring, failed and flailing Gov. Greg Abbott called legislators back to the Capitol for an irregular extra legislative session, with the specific goal of giving Republicans a second shot at passing the hateful anti-voter legislation. Amid these escalating attacks, Texas Democrats have continued to stand our ground \u2014 bolstered by support from our nation\u2019s highest office. Urging Congress to restore voting rights protections, President Biden quoted the late Congressman John Lewis, saying, \u201cFreedom is not a state, it\u2019s an act.\u201d Vice President Harris thanked Texas Democratic lawmakers for their leadership, saying, \u201cYou acted in a way that is encouraging other people to take action. You are igniting something that is so important.\u201d\n\nTexas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa also expressed gratitude for the \u201cincredible leadership President Biden is showing through his urgent advocacy for voting rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexas Democrats are refusing to back down in the fight for voting rights, and our President and Vice President are stepping forward to fight just as hard alongside us,\u201d he said, calling on every Democrat in Congress to \u201crise to the occasion, fight for our communities, and do what has to be done to protect our right to vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur democracy is in jeopardy. Our future is on the line,\u201d he warned, demanding Congress to act.\n\nThe Democrat-led House passed the For the People Act this year, which 20 attorneys general described as unconstitutional legislation.\n\nHours prior to its passage, 20 attorneys general, led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R),\u00a0sent\u00a0a letter addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). H.R. 1 \u201cbetrays several Constitutional deficiencies and alarming mandates that, if passed, would federalize state elections and impose burdensome costs and regulations on state and local officials,\u201d they wrote, detailing the Elections Clause of Article I of the Constitution and the Electors Clause of Article II, which gives states the primary role in conducting federal elections for House and Senate, and an even bigger role in presidential elections. \u201cThe Act would invert that constitutional structure, commandeer state resources, confuse and muddle elections procedures, and erode faith in our elections and systems of governance,\u201d the attorneys general wrote, asking lawmakers to consider the measure\u2019s many \u201cvulnerabilities.\u201d H.R. 1, they continued, \u201cimplicates the Electors Clause\u201d by regulating the elections for president and vice president. The state leaders also highlighted the \u201csevere constitutional hurdles\u201d the measure faces due to its \u201cregulation of congressional elections, including by mandating mail-in voting, requiring states to accept late ballots, overriding state voter identification (\u201cID\u201d) laws, and mandating that states conduct redistricting through unelected commissions.\u201d\n\nSigners, which included the\u00a0attornies general from Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia, promised to \u201cseek legal remedies to protect the Constitution, the sovereignty of all states, our elections, and the rights of our citizens\u201d if the bill becomes law.",

Dick Durbin of Illinois and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\n\n  \n  \u201cThis bill is going to allow us to make sure that all the fines and penalties that are from federal cases go to the victims, the Crime Victims Fund, to rebuild this fund, because it\u2019s badly needed,\u201d Biden told those gathered in the East Room of the White House. \u201cThis is going to enable us to provide more help and support to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking and other crimes all across America.\u201d\n\n\n\n  \n  The President took the opportunity to call on Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, telling lawmakers in the room, \u201cIt\u2019s long past time to reauthorize and strengthen the protections through the Violence Against Women Act \u2013 please, please.\u201d\n\n\n\n  \n  \u201cWe know from experience you all can come together in a bipartisan, bicameral way to pass this bill. We need to do the same thing to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act without further delay,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n  \n  Biden also offered shout-outs to his late son, Beau Biden, and to Vice President Kamala Harris, who as former attorneys general of their states prioritized funding for victims of assault.\n\n\n\n  \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to be able to sign this,\u201d Biden said, signing the bill. \u201cThis is one of those deals where what they did is literally and figuratively going to change the lives of women and children and some men out there.\u201d",

    "body": "I come to explain Joe Manchin, not to praise him.\n\nThe West Virginia senator has earned the ire of the Online Left for single-handedly holding up legislation near and dear to progressive hearts, including ending the filibuster, because the party can afford no defections with the Senate split 50-50. His latest outrage is expressing opposition in a Charleston Gazette-Mail op-ed this weekend to H.R. 1/S. 1, the For the People Act, which would redress many of the wing-nut efforts taking place in red states across the country to limit voters\u2019 rights.\n\nAs upsetting as some of Manchin\u2019s stances might be, blue-state Democrats need to understand where he\u2019s coming from, both geographically and politically, both before they attack him and as they plan political and policy responses. A lack of understanding of those with whom we disagree is at the root of much of our country\u2019s current partisan division. If we incorporate this binary thinking into our party itself, it will only set us back further.\n\nYet based on these recent attacks, it\u2019s clear that progressives don\u2019t understand Manchin \u2014 and aren\u2019t trying to. The essential context is that Manchin wasn\u2019t elected in one of the blue states from which much of this criticism is originating, so his political realities are very different.\n\nManchin has been called an \u201celectoral miracle,\u201d and a quick glance at how other Democrats do in West Virginia shows just how much he is an outlier. The sheer math (Joe Biden got less than 30 percent of the vote in West Virginia) tells us he's lucky to have been elected at all.\n\nThat means if Manchin wants to keep his seat, he needs to be the kind of Democrat West Virginians will reward: centrist and independent, which sometimes means flouting the party when a sweeping, controversial piece of legislation is moving down the track with the winds of Twitter as its driving force.\n\nProgressives also don\u2019t seem to understand what\u2019s at stake with an all-or-nothing approach on the issues \u2014 in this case, requiring Manchin to accept all 800-odd pages of S. 1 or face persecution from his own party.\n\nThe fact is the Democrats wrote this 800-plus-page document during a time when it had no chance of passing \u2014 in 2019, when the GOP controlled the Senate \u2014 so it\u2019s packed not only with needed voting safeguards but also progressive wish-list items like redistricting and campaign finance reform. Because the measure itself would never come up for a vote, it was instead written as a \u201cmessaging bill\u201d to cudgel Republicans and rally the Democratic base.\n\nWhen Democrats took over the Senate, they didn\u2019t do the necessary introspection and propose a more realistic version essential to securing the voting rights measures we sorely need as Republican states push a nationwide cascade of voter repression bills. Instead, they pressed on with the ambitious messaging version as though it were written in good legislative faith.\n\nTo give just one example, tucked within the 800 pages are things like the Freedom From Influence Fund, which creates a 6-to-1 federal matching program for small-dollar donors. That may be worthwhile, but it is overwhelmingly unpopular. Legislators from red and purple areas can\u2019t reflexively pass provisions like these that have so little popular support if they want to get re-elected (never mind respect the will of their constituents).\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between preserving the sanctity of American elections and inserting a wish list of priorities blatantly specific to one party, and that\u2019s the point Manchin is so desperately attempting to make. In his op-ed, he described the debate over the bill as \u201cnot about finding common ground, but seeking partisan advantage.\u201d\n\nNBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d First Read captured this dynamic succinctly Tuesday: \u201cHR1/the For the People Act was designed as a messaging bill that includes not only voting-rights protections \u2014 but also redistricting and campaign-finance reform. And now Democrats have an activist base that\u2019s upset and disappointed \u2014 over a bill that never had a chance for passage in a 50-50 Senate.\u201d\n\nBut there are also parts of H.R. 1 that are popular and much more achievable. For instance, in his essay, Manchin also outlined his case for passing a version of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. That bill would reinstate the full extent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (a pretty good law!) and layer on additional protections.\n\nIn the 2020 election, progressives were confident there would be a landslide and so overshot reality with rhetoric that caused losses. The same thing is happening with the Senate agenda. It\u2019s an approach that helps some Democrats and activist groups in deep-blue states with fundraising, greater prominence and the like, yet hurts red-district Democrats \u2014 and real people, including on voting rights.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to be a Democratic Party that's truly for everyone, we cannot be intolerant toward leaders like Manchin, who choose to take the often lonely yet largely productive route of independence that appeals to voters from across the spectrum.\n\nI live in South Carolina, and I don\u2019t need to be lectured from Brooklyn or Boston or Berkeley about accepting less than what\u2019s legislatively ideal with every bill considered in this country. Manchin\u2019s positioning in West Virginia is part of the sacrifices necessary to keeping his seat blue, even if it\u2019s a different shade of blue than other members of his party want to see from him.\n\nTo my good friends in blue states who tremble at the idea of a Donald Trump restoration in 2024, the future of your fearful imaginations is already a reality where I live. When I drive through rural South Carolina, I pass roadside markets selling \u201cTrump 2024\u201d flags. The Republican Party isn\u2019t giving up on him, his approach or his ideologies anytime soon.\n\nHard as it is to imagine in sky-blue enclaves, there is immense value to a Democrat in states where the word itself is considered blasphemous. If we are to combat Trumpism, we need to allow Democrats like Manchin a little maneuverability. Incidentally, while Manchin is the most willing to stick his neck out, he\u2019s not the only Democrat with these concerns.\n\nIf Manchin were to lose a primary to a more liberal Democrat, a threat launched just two weeks after inauguration toward Manchin and another moderate, it\u2019s all but certain his Senate seat would turn red in the general election. Democrats need to realize that we simply do not have the ability to implement all of our gauzy progressive dreams.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why extending some compassion toward and recognition of Manchin\u2019s circumstances would be helpful. While Republicans are known as the \u201cfall in line\u201d party, Democrats entertain a level of self-criticism and accountability that makes the party more diverse, welcoming and stronger. If we\u2019re to remain the party that permits healthy dissension and some ideological diversity, accepting Manchin for who he is comprises a vital part of that.",
